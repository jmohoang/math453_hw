                        Last year, my Anthony was diagnosed with Hypoxic Brain Injury due to nearly drowning after a seizure episode while bathing. Doctors are still unsure how per say to treat this. However during our 11 month journey, we have meet some wonderful parents, children and survivors who have provided us with information and proven studies of what works. Hypoxic-anoxic injury, also known as HAI, occurs when that oxygen flow is disrupted, essentially starving the brain and preventing it from performing vital biochemical processes.Hypoxic refers to a partial lack of oxygen; anoxic means a total lack.The diminished oxygen supply can cause serious impairments in cognitive skills, as well as in physical, psychological and other functions. Currently Anthony is responsive but still lacks alot of basic skills which makes him completely disabled. He currently receives therapy 3 times a week. The FDA has recently approved the use of 2 drugs, along with stem cell therapy that would help Anthony and give him a better recovery rate. Of course, these cutting-edge therapies are not covered on our insurance. They are considered an ""out-of-pocket elective."" The money raised would help pay for travels for Anthony to Orlando and receive 2 rounds of a 3-day treatment of these medications to help him live a longer happier life. We will not give in to this prognosis. The kids and I will be the continued backbone and strength Anthony needs.We would forever be grateful for any support offered by our friends and family. Thank you for reading our story. Please continue to follow his journey via facebook and instagram@Supermananthony_Signed,Momma Ty

DELMAR, NY                                





                        On June 22, 2016, Martin Ryfa suffered a tragic accident breaking his C1, C2 and C3 vertebrae. A hematoma pressing on the C2 vertebrae caused complete paralysis. With immediate surgery, the doctors were able to stabilize his broken vertebrae and relieve the pressure on the C2 vertebrae from the hematoma. The doctors are optimistic that Marty will be able to walk again, but it will take a great deal of time, focus, commitment and hard work. And for those of us who know Marty, weknow that he is always concerned about his wife, Beverly (who has been by his side every step of the way) and their beautiful daughter, Danielle. This fund will be used to help offset the financial burden the Ryfa family are incurring so that they may all focus on Martys recovery. As friends, colleagues and even acquaintances, we must all rally behind Marty and ensure that he gets the best therapies and the newest technologies available in order to win the biggest war of his lifetime. Researchers are continually working on new treatments, including robotics and medications that may promote nerve cell regeneration or improve the function of the nerves that remain after a spinal cord injury. While some of these new treatments may not be covered by insurance, we cant let that stop Marty from accessing them in order to regain his life.Any donation will be gratefully appreciated. Marty is a warrior. Whatever your faith, whatever your beliefs, pray for Martys recovery  both spiritually and physically.

WARRENVILLE, IL                                





We need YOUR help!! Jimmy is currently living in a 3 level townhome with his grandma (Lora), mom (Gia), brother (Sonny) and dog (Rose). There is a total of 27 steps in his home. Jimmy is bound to a wheelchair, weighs 55 lbs and is 4'1 . His mom (who weighs 114 lbs and is 5'2) has to carry him up and down the stairs all day long.This family is in desperate need of a ranch home and there just so happens to be a perfect home for them right next door to their cousins! Not only is it a ranch but the fact that there is family right next door means that there is even more support for Gia!We just need a down payment! This home is priced to sell and will not be on the market long. PLEASE help us give this family the home they so desperatly need!JIMMY'S BACK STORY:At birth Jimmy appeared to be healthy, with the exception of club feet. However after a few days his parents noticed that sucking a bottle and trying to feed him was extremely difficult and within a few months Jimmy was not hitting any developmental milestones. ""Failure to thrive"" was a common term used to describe his development. Jimmy was taken to see a neurologist and it was revealed he had Agenesis Corpus Callosum. A rare neurological disorder in which part of his brain did not develop along with some abnormalities. Jimmy was also diagnosed with Mitochondria, a rare progressive genetic disorder. Mitochandria causes damage to the cells of the brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscles, kidney, endocrine and respiratory systems. Symptoms include loss of motor control, muscle weakness, gastro intestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties, poor growth, seizures and much more. 80% of children diagnosed will only live a few weeks, and of the 20% of children who make it, have a life expectance of 16 years old. Jimmy is currently attending school, is extremely smart, has a great sense of humor and loves to interact with people. ""Failure to thrive"" is not used to describe him despite the fact that he is wheelchair bound and non verbal. His determination to learn and communicate overpower his disabilities. Because Jimmy's parents and family focus on his ABILITIES, Jimmy has overcome many obstacles, like turning 8 this past May and saying his first sentence ""I LOVE YOU"". Jimmy has brought so much love and light into this world and has the ability to touch the hearts of everyone he meets!

                        The judicial system has given my 2 daughters to their abusive mother and drug addict boyfriend. CPS was involved and they do not see anything wrong with my girls living in a garage where her mother cannot even provide for them. I barely get any visitation and they are making me to be the bad person because I am a big black man, because statistics say black men can't take care of children. I love my girls more than life itself and I just want to be able to get an attorney and fight this system right so that my girls can come home. They have cried to the judge and mediators but they still point the finger at me saying I brainwashed them. But I haven't had them in my care for almost 3 years. Please help me and help my girls.

Our friend, Sarah Mallory, was riding her bike home from work Tuesday night. She was hit by a speeding car who fled the scene. Authorities do not have any leads as to who hit her. Sarah was thankfully wearing a helmet but unfortunately sustained three vertebral fractures. She is *currently* in surgery to fix her cervical vertebrae. With any accident, surgery, especially spinal, she will be out of work for quite awhile and will be faced with medical bills on top of her physical recovery. Please donate a little bit to lessen the costly burden of her recovery so she can focus on her health. Sarah is incredibly kind, gentle and giving and would do whatever was necessary and in her power to help anyone in her life, whether that be human, canine or feline. Thank you!!

My safe and beautiful room was traded for that of a hospitalone...................Now I cannot speak or move, but my brain is developmental and cognitively age-appropriate. I am a FIGHTER and I have been fighting for my life for 30 months in 3 different hospitals, mainly in pediatric intensive care units in each hospital. Since October 17th, 2013, I have been with mami and papi at home, but I am still very weak and need the experimental medicine and research so that I could get stronger. I love to go out, but I am confined to the area where I live, because I need a wheelchair accessible van to travel. My mommy and daddy found one but it's expensive and we need your help. Please consider giving whatever amount you can give. I would LOVE to go out and see the beautiful world that exist outside of my neighborhood.

                        You don't know me but my name is Stacy. The man you see in the photo is my husband Scott.Scott is a father of 3 boys and a grandfather to a little girl of which he will be missing her 1st birthday this weekend (09/25/16). He's an amazing man who does all he can to help anyone he sees in need and he now needs your help.Scott was in a horrible motorcycle accident on Monday, September 19th, 2016 that almost left him paralyzed from the neck down. Had me moved his neck just 3milimeters either direction he would have been paralyzed. He sustained multiple injuries and is expected to be the hospital for a minimum of 3 months. These are thingsthat are broken,2 (C4 and C5)vertebratesin his neck,4 dislodged (C2,C3, C6 and C7)vertebrates, 4 (T7 to T10) vertebrates in his back,1 broken rib, 1 floating rib, collar bone, shoulder blade, shoulder, and wrist.He is looking at having a minimum of 4 surgeries to try to put his body back to normal. The money that we raise is going towards all hospital expenses that are not covered by insurance. We are struggling as I am the sole providor of our family. I'm not asking for our rent to be paid or anything like that. We are truly trying to raise funds to help with all medical expenses we are accuring while he's in the hospital. We are so willing to take anything to help us. I had to put a dollar amount but the $20,000 is our limitisn't even going to help cover the cost of thesurgery that's he's having today(09/21/16, he had the surgery and there is a minor concern with movement). Anything that you can spare would help our family in this time of need. My husband is the kind of man that if he sees you stuck on the side of the road, he will travel miles to be able to turn around to come help you. He's a sweet, kind hearted man who has been there for his family, friends and strangers. This things gives me ""writing tips"" to follow and one ""suggestion"" is, ""how thankful I will be""... Oh my, I don't think you could even imagine how thankful our whole family will be. The fact that we could pay his medical bills would help keep us in our apartment and keep the lights and food on the table on since I'd be using the donated money to pay medical bills and using my income to pay rent so my family has a place to stay and a home for Scott to come home to. Any amount that you can help with would be beyond appriecated. Thank you for taking the time to read about my husband and thank you so much for taking the time to help us by donating.Only a person who asks for help will recieve help from an unknown source. I hope you are willing to be that unknown source to my family. Thank you and god bless your soul for helping a stranger.

FRANKLIN, TN                                




On Thursday September 22nd, Deborah received a call from the police that her daughter and her family had been involved in a serious car wreck in Florida. This is a parents worst nightmare to receive this type of call, and at that time that is all authorities would tell her.Deborah was able to get a flight to Orlando and arrived by mid-afternoon to be greeted with some very bad news. Due to injuries sustainded during the wreck, her son in law passed away, her daughter had received brain injuries, broken ribs, and punctured lungs. Her daughter has since had brain surgery and is currently in a medical induced coma. Also in the car was Deborahs pride and joy, her grandbabies. Both of them received minor injuries with a broken arm being the most serious.To make things worse, this wreck occurred in a town that the family was visiting, and therefore do not have a natural support system both mentally and momentarily to help during this very difficult time.There are a lot of unknowns with the next steps for Deborahs daughter and their family, so this account will help offset any cost that will occur over the next couple of weeks and months. This will include lodging, transportation cost, food, and anything else that will they during this time.Thanks for your generosity and helping Deborah and her family during this very trying time in their lives. Lets make sure that the ony thing Deborah and her family has to worry about during time is attending to her daughter and grandkids. Deborah has already mentioned how grateful she is to be surrounded by so many great friends and coworkers.

                        Our family is struggling. We were evicted from our home for being late with April's rent. We have 2 children, ages 11 and 9. Our 11 year old is Autistic and this change is not good for him. We had to surrender our beloved family pets. We're all heartbroken and scared. My income is keeping us alive while we look for a much cheaper home. We were in over our heads with our house and couldn't keep up with it. We need to rent a smaller house or an apartment.  We need help putting together a deposit for a new home. We know a lot of people have helped us in the past and we haven't been able to repay it. We are hopeful that a smaller monthly rental will change things for us so we can repay all the people who have helped us at any point. Please consider helping us through this horrible time. We are forever grateful to all those who have helped us.Holly and Greg Gately

                        I am trying to raise money to afford adequate legal representation.  My daughter is my blood life. I have learned it is better not to voice the details of my case...everything I've said has been used against me since this began. I knew in my heart that it wasn't up to me to decide wether or not My daughters father was in my childs life.  It was her choice. I loved my daughter and embraced motherhood from before I knew I was pregnant, my clock was ticking so to speak.  I named her before I knew it was a girl, because I knew she was a girl. The reality here is that I work full time and still I am on food stamps  I do not make enough to afford the commute of 3 hours for each court hearing. My daughters dad is a man with impenetrable financial resource and yet assists in no way for child care or support. I am a nurse assistant and one day I hope to be a nurse practitioner. I want to keep going to school but with this battle I'm not able to handle the weight of work, court, parenting and school. I've had to give up on that dream for now and stay focused on ""winning"" custody. My daughter needs me, and I need her. And we both need me to be in a better way financially. School advancement will get us there, one day.  In my work I am lucky enough to care for those who really need my help. Now I really need your help. I can say with certainty the blessings will be payed forward. I want to have life back where I can take my daughter to the zoo, swim lessons and not be afraid of gas running out on the way to school.  I want to live the life where I am the woman I teach my daughter to be, not the half shell I am...I have worked my way through school and worked my way to a career all while forging through the hells of custody battle after custody battle...our last trial is this december. Please, help us to end this and get back to living. I thank you, from every fiber of my being. Thank you. And may this year bring love and life for you.

                        Hi everybody,My name is Danna Delgado, and I am an Ecuadorian USF student. As you might have seen in the news, Ecuador suffered a 7.8 earthquake this Saturday April 16th. My country suffered an enormous impact since we are not prepared for these kind of disasters. This led to a lot of deaths and wounded, as well as orphans, and the numbers keep increasing.Being at the distance in a moment like this, is hard for me and for my Ecuadorian fellows that are studying abroad. So we decided to start this fundraising campaign to send money directly to the volunteer doctors that are helping stabilize the wounded.We want to collect, and send the money to the Ecuadorian medical teams in order to buy the medicine, aid, and food people need. My sister, Kristel Delgado, is one of the volunteer doctors, and she is assingend to a specific medical team; were they buy medical supplies and send them directly (by light aircraft) to the affected areas. All the funds will go directly to the Medic Volunteers, and they will manage the money from there. Also, part of the funds will go to Dr. Robert Fuller's project to rebuild Ecuador (info on this:  www.savingecuador.com). Lastly, we will buy tents for the people who lost their homes, and send them through the embassy in Miami. Every week a truck leaves from Tampa with the donations.Please help our country, a lot of people are in need. There are so many wounded that cant be stabilized yet because of the scarce resources our country has. Even a small donation, even if you think is not much, it contributes as a huge help for the people of our country.

                        David and I were married in August of 2008. He married me knowing that I would not be able to give him children of our own so we prayed and prayed some more. Over time God had given us a heart to adopt a child through the foster system. On December 21st 2013 God blessed the world with our little Lucy and on Dec 26th God blessed our marriage with Lucy. At first it was hard for both of us but through many tears, sleepless nights and prayer God changed our hearts to love Lucy unconditionally. After having Lucy with us for about 4 months the adoptive mother of Lucy's biological brother came out of the woodworks saying she wanted Lucy. At first it seemed that the people responsable for Lucy's placement decision were saying that she should stay with us. Now at 10 months (11 months on the court date) the decision will be made. It seems that the people making the decision now is wantingLucy to go to this woman that came out of the wood works. We have been advised to get a lawyer to be a voice for both David and I. We believe that GOD has EVERYTHING under control but that God also gave us the ability to get a lawyer as well. We pray fervrently that Lucy stays with us and it kills me that we are having to go through this. I sit here staring at the screen crying that Lucy can be taken from us, but I believe that everything happens for a reason and GOD has everything under control.I ask as my family and friends that you please donate to this page so we can have the ability to have our voices heard. I know things are tight on money but every little bit helps and if you can't donate money then I ask that you donate time by praying for peace wisdom and joy for us and everyone involved in making this decision. I thank you for everything and I love you all in Christ.....Arica Freire

                        Loughglynn United FC was first founded in 1976. Since, then we have called the community pitch in Loughglynn our home. Our current changing rooms have stood at the community pitch in Loughglynn since redevelopment in 1997. On Friday 26/06/2015 those same changing rooms were destroyed by fire.All involved with the club and the community at large are devastated with the news. Our changing rooms are a vital part of the club, without them we face an uncertain future and may not be able to provide a soccer club for the people in the community.However this will not stop us. We will rebuild and once again be a large part of this small community in west Roscommon. We are asking for any and all donations big or small to rebuild the facilities we have lost. We will return bigger and better.We plan to redevelop the site destroyed by this horrible event and create a space that all members of the local community can use, not just those involved in the soccer club.

                        Hi - my name is Usman and I'm writing this on behalf of Gail Culp. Gail's house has flooded because of the torrential rainfall in Houston these last 24 hours. Both of her cars (one pictured) are underwater and totaled. Her house currently has over 2 feet of water. I would like to raise this money to help her during this tough time. Ideally I would like to get this campaign started and monies funded as soon as possible so she can have some relief.Gail is an essential part of the MFRM family. She is a tireless worker and a great employee.  I would really appreciate if you donate a few dollars (or more) to help her through this tough time. It would mean a lot to her and her family if we are able to support her during her time of need. Thank you.

Last night we had a tree fall and crush our only means of transportation. We have insurance and they've said its most likely a total loss but we're just waiting on the final paper work. We currently owe about 5,000 more than the car is worth so once it's totaled out and the payment is made to the bank we will still owe that amount. The car company we purchased it through is willing to erase the debt we owe if we bring them $500 down and repurchase a vehicle through them. We have a rental for 10 days but after that we won't have a vehicle for Andrew to get back and forth to work in or for me and our three kids to do things like doctors apts and grocery trips... There's no way we can come up with $500 in 10 days with Andrews hours having been cut recently so we need help for our friends and family... Anything is greatly appreciated!

YAKIMA, WA                                




Hi, I'm Reva Marx. My husband, Andrew Marx and I live with our 2 small children and my disabled mother, my uncle who has a TBI (traumatic brain injury), and my elderly step dad. Back in 2005- 2006, my uncle had a house built for us to live in. It was to be ours as we cared for my ailing grandparents. The home was custom made to be wheelchair accessible because I was supposed to be wheelchair Bound by 20. We picked the cabinetry and all interior, made repairs, and changes as it was supposed to be our home. Well, we lost my grandfather on May 15, 2014 and my grandmother December 28th, 2014. My youngest was almost 8 weeks old. We were notified by my uncle after, that we didn't have anything room worry about, we didn't have to move. and that he was puting a manufactured home on the back of our lot so my uncle Don had a place to live since the estate house was to be sold. Again, because the home was built for us. I, myself am disabled as well due to PTSD and blown disks in my back as well as multiple birth defects. My husband is also disabled due to severe Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Crohns disease. I was told I couldn't have children but miraculously, after 3 years of marriage, my husband and I were blessed with 2 beautiful boys. Anyways back to the reason I'm making this; 
After the death of my grandparents, my uncle was put as executor of the estate (Which is still open almost 2 years later by the way). He has a law background and is a multi millionaire.
He, his wife, along with a few greedy family.members decided they would call in a false CPS reports. I had an investigation and they closed the case as unfounded after our surprise home visit and I explained why I thought it was in retaliation and gave names. After that, and multiple calls to the police to come to my home by the cousin, he sends us a notice to vacate 2 days before my mother's birthday. Only after he threatens to have the Washington bar commit my uncle and has him so upset he can't sleep. Now we need help with legal fees to fight this. Agreeing a home is for someone , after 10 years, there's no way we can find somewhere else on what very limited income we recieve ( SSI and SSDI). The funds donated will go to legal fees and worst case, to a home for my family. Thank you! We have until October 31st and we have an an attorneywilling to take our case. He should not be allowed to get by with this just because he is rich. He is a bully and they need stoped! As my mother taught me, Whats right is right, and whats wrong is wrong. Please help us stand up for what's right! Thank you so much. I have never ben more afraid for my little family.

My name is Reginald Smith im from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I'm a U.S Marine Veteran who lost everything in this Great Flood of 2016. I wasn't here for the hurricane Katrina disaster but i heard a lot of stories, not knowing my return home i would encounter loosing my home to such a disaster. I was trapped twice in the flood where i assisted in helping other families get rescued before me i also rescued 2 pets that were chained to someone's backyard that a family had left behind you could hear the dog crying for help. People asked how did i get trapped twice after i made it out from my house i found my sister and mother whos houses got flooded also. I got trapped again by going into my sisters flooded area trying to get cloths out of my sisters house for my niece and nephew's. Its a experience i will never forget. I started this go
fund me page for my 
family and myself. I never done a fundraiser before so i decided why not and i thought why not use this platform 
for other families that i know who 
were effected by the flood also. This is not about scamming people or trying
to come up. I set a goal at 6,000 hopefully i raise more. I plan to give half to
other families that truly needs it and
also to sponsor a concert to raise 
more. U never knows what it feels like till it has effected u. So if u would like to donate it would be gladly appreciated. If i had the funds i would help everyone who took a lost. Im just a U.S Marine Veteran trying to do my part. Thank you and God Bless. If you have any questions you can leave a message and i will respond.

On 4/22/14 I was on my way to do what I love the most in this world, putting a smile on peoples faces with my comedy. I was side swipped by a 18 wheeler causing me to lose control of my vehicle,and causing me to crash head on into a huge tree. The 18 Wheeler did not stop. I was in the middle of changing insurances (thus not covered). My car was totaled,which I still owe on. I was then taken to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital with serious injuries for 4 days. The VA has informed me that my medical bills are not going to be covered by the VA. I am asking my family, friends, and fans if you can please help during this critical time in my life. For those of you who know me, it is killing me to ask for help. But there has come a time where I must put my pride aside and ask for assistance. I would appreciate any help that you could give no matter how small or large. May God Bless you and Thank you from the Bottom of My Heart. Your Friend, Mario Salazar

I'm often loathe to discuss my financial situation, and we pride ourselves on scrounging/finding ways to get the job done. We're proud people, and that is not a badge of honor- it is an admission of guilt.Despite our best wheedling and scrounging, the necessity of a car purchase at the end of June has wrecked havoc on our ability to _do_ said scrounging. We had already cut expenses to the bone, with the things we did free or otherwise paid/budgeted for.Many of the other efforts we launched this Spring have paid dividends, and bills were getting paid. In some of those cases, work completed has not yet resulted in payment delivered.We are in a gap situation. What cushion we had has been exhausted, what margin of error eliminated. Our breathing room returns in September, but we've found ourselves a tad short at present.If you can help, we'd appreciate it.

Our immediate current financial needs are:

Remainder of July rent: 600.

August rent: 700.

Utility bills: July is 185, August is 100.

Total: 1585.

If you can help, we would greatly appreciate it. We are working on rewards at present, which will include several diverse options drawing on both of our strengths. This will include poetry, art, cooking, party planning, odd jobs, etc.

We also have a pile of medical bills that are laying untouched from procedures earlier this year that are around $6000.

                        Well it has been a long time over 18 months that they had our child and then tried to say that we have lost our bond that we have lost our connection with our son luckily none of that is true and he has been returned home to us and as a happy guy butt everyday we struggle with basic necessities and still cannot keep up on the things we need like our car that is holding together with possibly rust alone has so much damage I am amazed that we have still been able to get our son back and forth to school let alone all the other needs that we have realistically I have asked our local community are churches our service centers and have even gone on to private areas on Facebook to ask for help and there have been some very wonderful people that we have met along the way that have helped us out in one way or another but even with all the help we are struggling just to keep things afloat and every day we're wondering where that next dollar is going to come from for instance both me and my wife I have celiac disease and the big problem with that is it is not a choice to eat something that has gluten in it so we have to buy the more expensive dietary Foods which limits what we can buy for our family which limits what we can buy for our son and it makes it very difficult to be able to provide proper meals everyday and we continue to look for options we continue to look for help and a better way to do things at the same time hoping that good people will step up and assist us when at all possible it has been amazing how much negative feedback we have gotten for asking for help at least 10 times the amount of people that have helped have belittled and accused us of many things but it is always easy to judge someone else when you are not in their position how we do at this point is try to live our life in a positive way to accomplish positive things to make a better way for our son and our family so if you can help in any way if you can only donate a few dollars or if you want to contact us directly and just take us to buy groceries or to get clothing or possibly help in repairing our vehicle we are open to help in any way shape or form as our options are very limited. Once again I truly hope that someone out there will read our message and will understand that we do truly need help and will do what they can to make things better for us so down the line hopefully we can do the same for others, thank you everyone for your time http://fox17online.com/2015/04/23/father-fighting-for-to-get-his-son-back-and-medical-marijuana-rights-after-felony-charge-for-smear-of-butane-hash-oil/  http://fox17online.com/2015/02/25/father-fighting-to-use-medical-marijuana-concentrates-not-protected-under-law/OTTAWA COUNTY, Mich.  Medical marijuana is a controversial, sometimes sticky issue, especially in Michigan.Max Lorincz is a father from Spring Lake who is fighting for his right to use medical marijuana, and get his son back. Hes a card-carrying patient, but was charged with a felony, after a single smear of oil was found in his home.After Lorinczs probable cause hearing has left him waiting for a decision from a judge.Since seeing FOX 17s coverage of Lorinczs case back in February, Defense Attorney and President of the Michigan Medical Marijuana Association Michael Komorn took on Lorinczs case pro-bono. For the last six years, Komorn said hes dedicated his practice exclusively to medical marijuana patient and caregiver representation.Komorn called Lorinczs case scandalous, and said a major problem here is law enforcement dealing with a public health issue.Like many card-carrying medical marijuana patients across the state, Lorincz is caught between his doctors orders and a judge.When I follow my doctor`s recommendations that`s when my health started to get better; going back and following what the judge is saying, my health is just deteriorating ever since, said Lorincz. So it`s a scary road I`m going down, but I have to comply with what they`re asking and I just don`t know what else to do.But his case has come with some devastating consequences. In February Lorincz was charged with a two-year felony: possession of a schedule 1, controlled, synthetic substance. Schedule 1 is defined as a controlled substance that has no medical use.Now his five-year-old son is taken away, and he is left with only supervised visits. All of this because Lorincz called 911 in September for a family medical emergency. The deputy who responded to the call found a smear of butane hash oil in his home. Its a substance Lorincz ingests for what he called deep pain relief, and is something he obtained with his medical marijuana card.Im outraged by it, it shouldnt have happened, said Komorn.Komorn said medical marijuana is not a controlled substance. In fact, Michigan law states marijuana is a schedule 2 drug. Yet because Lorincz is charged with having a schedule 1 drug, and not specifically marijuana, Komorn said it is difficult to protect Lorincz under section 8 immunity of the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act.Komorn believed part of the issue is a recent policy change in Michigan State Police Lab reporting.They had a policy change by why? asked Komorn. The policy changed. The motivation for it was if they report it this way, people like Max wont be able to claim a medical marijuana defense.The lab technician in Lorinczs case testified that he has been testing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, for 25 years. THC is the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, also present in synthetics. However, a recent policy change means the technicians have to write origin unknown when testing this type of THC on lab reports. The technician said he could not tell if the sample was synthetic or natural.The prosecution argued Lorinczs residue was not usable marijuana, as defined in the previous court case, People versus Carruthers; therefore, Lorincz should be bound over for trial. However, Komorn argued that a hash extraction comes directly from the resin of the plant.Komorn said this lab policy change is the difference between a felony and no charge at all for Lorincz, stating he should be protected under the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act. Komorn asked the judge to dismiss it.(The lab technician) admitted that on the stand, said Komorn. That is very, very, very disturbing to me, because it means that the politics in the law are affecting the truth. Thats not how its supposed to be. Were supposed to rely on science to make the case.For now Lorincz said he is following courts orders and is back to taking what he calls debilitating prescription pain-killers.He is fighting to get his son back, and then to use the medicine he says works best, without having to smoke it.If nobody stands up for this and it just keeps going the way it is, how many more people are going to get thrown under the bus just for using their prescribed medicine? asked Lorincz. It`s just ridiculous.

                        Some of you that will see this already know our story, but there are many who will see it that do not. This is so hard for me to do, to put aside my pride and allow everyone to see our ""mess""....but desperate times call for desperate measures.My husband is no longer able to work. He had a heart attack and has congestive heart failure and diabetes with many related complications. Prior to that, he was the primary provider for our family. God is faithful, and eventually provided me with a part-time job, and now a full-time job. However, forseveral months we struggled and were unable to pay our rent. Our landlord has been very patient, and was letting us make payments, however-the amount owed has become too great and he is asking that we pay it by the end of this month or he will evict us. Those who know our story know that it has been filled with years of instability and struggle. We are finally in a ""home"", Eddie is in a great school, and I have a great job, very close to home, that I love. Walt is scheduled for his disability hearing this month, so we are praying for God's favor in that area so he can come home and contribute to the family income as well.So, bottom line, the landlord said if we pay him the $2000 back rent, and July's rent ($850), we can stay in our home. If you find it in your heart to help us, I would appreciate it more than I could ever express. Even small amounts add up. This is so hard to have to expose all ofthis, but i see my little boy's face and as a mother....I will do whatever it takes to provide for his needs.Thank you and God bless you all!!!

                        Our mom, Maria, was detained on December 19th, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. She was headed to the store and was pulled over due to smoke coming out of the car, the police officer eventually called border patrol because she did not have a state ID. She was sent to Eloy Detention Center and due to the fact that she has no criminal background, she has been given a bond. Our mom will be released from Eloy Detention Center when a bond of $4,000.00 is paid. Unfortunately, we do not have the full amount at our disposal. We would like for her to be released tomorrow so she can join us for the holidays. Any amount is necessary and will be greatly appreciated. Please share this with others.

                        Hello all and thank you very much for taking the time to read our story and consider helping us.We started this in November. At the time, we were due to lose our home, our car insurance, electricity, etc. We were able to meet our goals and got all of the above paid off just in time and paid for most of December's living expense bills as well. We are back in the same predicament due to me still being unable to work...and then to add on to my issues, my husband struggled with a stubborn kidney stone and missed a few weeks of work which really put a damper on things and set us back right where we were in November.So, here we are now again...begging for your help. January is days away...and February is right around the corner. I hope to be better by February, but if not, at least we will be receiving our taxes then and my husband's hours will also be picking up at the point. Our need is for help to get us through the next 2 months until we can stay afloat ourselves. We are both hard working good people, but have fallen on hard times due to a number of circumstances...my health being the primary downfall. We do not live extravagantly. In fact, we rent a very small condo. Our furnishings are mostly second hand..as well as our clothes. Our car is a 1994 and on the brink of dying. But, we have struggled to come this far. We put everything we had into moving back to our beach. The Northern cold was not good for my asthma, etc. It would just crush and destroy us to lose everything. The thought of taking my family to a shelter kills me. So, we put aside our pride and are asking for any and all help we can get...donations(every penny counts), sharing our story with others to spread the word to others who may be able to help and of course all the prayers we can get.A brief summary of my health issues(you can message me for details of the health issues or any other part that you would like to know more about...attempting to keep this at a quick read length)...rough pregnancy, c section, 3 months of bed rest for post partum preeclampsia, emergency tachycardia event that landed me in the ER...the Dr gave me a medication that you are not supposed to give to people with asthma and I woke up days later on life support, heart ablation surgery and they are still working on the worst of the symptoms which they think are due to an adrenal gland imbalance...which usually means there is a tumor on the adrenal gland. It has been a long time since I have been able to properly function let alone work with all of these issues back to back. We did our best to stay afloat on just my husband's wages, but with his hours being cut at the end of summer...it became impossible.So, here we are now. Please help us in any way you are able. I realize that there are many scams out there and many people are uncomfortable with making donations in this manner. I assure you we are a real family with a real problem and really need your help. I am willing to give you any info you need  to ease your mind and prove that we and all of this information is genuine. Message me if you have any questions. I would also like to let all of you know that our issues are temporary. When we are back on our feet, we will be paying forward all donations that we receive. Thank you and God bless!

                        I am a meat cutter on a limited income, that is going to be slashed in half at the start of the year because we must have health insurance for my beautiful epileptic wife, who is currently pursuing disability because she is unable to work. My paycheck will only cover some of rent and part of the utility bill. I'm ready for that because I paint well enough to get paid for it; however, the business is just starting out, so I am unable to address our immediate need for your help.We've received our court papers that get the eviction process in gear. By January 15, 2015, we will face eviction because we have no way to pay more than $1300 for back rent. The landlord took what we could give for several months, but clearly we're having trouble catching up. Both food and utilities conflict with the rent payment. So, either I pay part of the rent or I buy food for my children, two of whom are bottomless gut teenagers!!In addition to the eviction reality, we fear losing our only car, a '97 Ford Explorer, for which we owe over $500. It's not as desperate as the house itself. Lauren, our special needs daughter, pic'd above, has grown quite attached to this particular house. We want to do everything we can to keep this roof over Lauren's head!We can't give up, and we hope desperately for your assistance. We can't give up And we desperately need your help in making sure we can keep our place. The landlord wants us to stay, but I definitely need to take care of this imediatelyPlease help us keep our house and the car!!

                        Christine Fu is an extraordinary flamenco photographer who in the past years has become sought after and cherished by the California flamenco and dance community for her evocative and revolutionary photography of artists from Spain and the U.S. at festivals and concerts.  On her way home after photographing the opening night of the Bay Area Flamenco Festival, she was mugged and robbed by two men of all of her photographic equipment. In the process of trying to protect her equipment, she was bruised and hurt.  Apart from the traumatic event, she is unable to work as a photographer due to this loss.  Many of us in the community want to help her get back to her work - she is an irreplaceable asset to the artists, companies, students and flamenco community in which she works.  We want to raise the $5,000 in camera equipment that was stolen from her, and show her that she is beloved and needed and that our communities cannot wait the year or so she would need on her own to raise the money.Christine Fu has often generously both donated her time and efforts, or worked on our behalf at greatly reduced cost - now we would like to show her that we care and that we can come together to put her back to doing what she loves - being the true artist that she is.  Dance photography is a highly specialized field and it is a rare talent and artist that can bring the form to life...Christine is one of those talents and a generous spirit and we hope you will help!  All proceeds minus a 5% fee go directly to Christine upon the end of this fundraising campaign, so your pledge is held until the goal is reached.

MONSEY, NY                                





                        It is very difficult for me to do this, and with a very heavy heart, and many tears, but at this point I have run out of options, and I am pleading for help. I am a single Mom to a 13 year old boy. I work a full time job for an American company. I work very hard and many hours a day. But, because I work from Israel, I get paid a very low salary that is lower than minimum wage in the US. Up until this point, by the grace of G-D I have been able to manage for the most part. I am not really sure how, but I have been OK. This year has been an incredibly difficult year financially, and things have not been good. I still managed to get by up until a few months ago. That is when everything started to fall apart around me. My bills are seriously delinquent, my rent has not been payed, I now owe for 3 months, and we have not been able to get food in the house in a month. I live in RBS B so my options for help financially are pretty limited. I spoke with the Kupah Shel Tzeddaka here, but they are not able to help since their are much larger families that need more help than I do. Pretty much every organization that I have gone to told me the same thing. I would move to something cheaper, but I cannot afford to pay for a move. Moving still would not solve my problems since I would still need to pay my landlord what I owe. I have been given an ultimatum by my landlord, either pay up what I owe, or I need to leave immediately. I have started selling all of my belongings to try and get some money together. So far I have been able to make enough money off of my furniture, appliances, clothing books and seforim to keep things at bay in my bank account and pay the electricity since it was turned off. I am still trying to sell my belongings hoping to get more money together for the rent, but this could take time, or not happen at all. My son has started feeling the pressure as well since things have started disappearing from the house. I am pleading with everyone out there to please open up your hearts and help me so that I can keep a roof over our heads. I know that things are hard all around for everyone these days, but anything that you can do would be greatly appreciated. If you need references, please pm me for contacts that can vouch for my situation. We should all be Zoche to a Gut G'Benched Yur full of Mazel and Brocha, and much Parnassa.

                        Thanks for taking the time to read this. This all started with a leak from the toilet in the apartment up stairs. Informed manager (4/25/16) no one came for 3 weeks. This is while sewer water had been leaking out of ceiling onto bathroom and anyone trying to use toilet. Now Our family is being been exposed to mold for over two months. The apartment manager refused to fix it to code standards. Maintenance man didn't even have cleaning supplies or towels to clean up sewer water that went all over the bathroom. The manager has not made any efforts to rectify the issue. We have called every department possible and have not been able to find any assistance to get out of this situation. Having small children in the home (under 6yrs old) with this type of exposure is unacceptable. Being that there is no department in the city, or county, to help get us into emergency housing of some sort. We are asking if anyone can donate to help us get a hotel for us to keep our two young children out of harms way (along with ourselves). We have all been sick. And it's getting worse. The mold has got so bad it grew mushrooms. Below is a link of all of the photos to show what we've been dealing with. More photos of mold growth

We overcame many obstacles prior to driving cross country and kept our heads held high. We stepped out on a leap of faith, things have started falling apart and now have to pick up the pieces. We've went to numerous job fairs, interviews, temp agencies, and spent hours in the library applying to jobs. We have met with people, trying to network and get connected. We've had no luck in finding employment thus far, and have been let down by promises made by people that couldn't be kept and now we have no transportation. We've held each other up during these lowest of times and have held out as long as we could. We know that God will see us through however, we are now faced with the challenge of getting our vehicle back after getting stranded in a parking garage when the car was repossessed. Time isn't on our side and we're out of money. So we are reaching out to those who can open their hearts and understand the situation. Derek and I aren't proud of the predicament we are currently in ,but we are both strong God fearing men who will overcome the circumstances. We are over two thousand miles away from home and can't be without our car. These circumstances are severe and we appreciate anyone who is able to help!

Lots of people have lost their homes, family members and friend; they are sleeping in the streets, food, water and medical supplies are running out. The poorest areas are the most affected.

On the morning of Saturday August 13, 2016, I opened my eyes in absolute horrorto see an abundance of destruction and what I went to bed the night before was just a hard fast rain over my hometown, Lafayette, LA. I immediately checked Facebook and it was like a movie playing in slow motion. My best friend since high school, Amy Menard, who just moved back to Maurice, La. from Dallas, Tx was sharing live post from her home, where she, her father and adopted son Brysenlive, be taken over by floodwaters. I watched in horror as she would walk from room to room taking video of floodwater intheir residencealong with the belongings she just moved in from Texas less than 6 months ago, be destroyed by floodwater and trash that was floating from near and far in her neighborhood. She would retreat to her godmother and Uncle Raymond's home located on higher ground only to find the water would follow them there, too. At that point, she watched as waters rushed in covering not just her and her father's vehicles, but those of her aunt and uncle, too. They stood on the porch exhausted, helpless and afraid andcalled 911 to be rescued fromwhat she has known as ""home"" for her entire life. She wouldn't unplug from social media without telling her mother that she missed her on what would be the 4th anniversary of her sudden passing. This somehow gave me hope - I knew Miss Linda was up there watching over them and that things would be ok, also knowing they might get worse before they got better.I inboxed Amy for a sign, I heard nothing.Amy, Brysen, father Wilbur, Nanny, Uncle Raymondand her beloved poochwould be rescued via first responders and delivered to the Quality Innon a dryer side of town, without transportation, food, water orclothing butthankful to be high and dry. They were placedinjust one room, all six of them, hungry -without transportationand without ameans of getting food because a citywide curfew wasinvoked. They wouldforget hunger and pray instead. Today, they remainin the same room.After a brief assessment ofboth dwellings, its contents, vehicles and other property, EVERYTHING is lost. Family momentos, antiques,furniture, clothing, dishes, utensils, flooring, walls, YOU NAME IT, will have to be replaced. Insurance will cover balances,but afterfast food,upfront rental car costs,a change of clothes and hotel costs, they could really use a helping hand. Not a hand out, a hand up. Insurance will cover some of the cost of rebuilding the structures after deductibles are met, but the contents aren't covered. Brysen, who just started high school lost everything - I look at my daughter who is the same age and I could not imagine what might be going through his head - any of their heads. Amy and her family are the type of people that would give their absolute last for anyone andI just want to see them made whole again - well as whole as you can feel after having lost everything. I will support Amy and her beloved family through this, but I need YOUR help! Please help me, help them as soon as possible! Any amount will help. In the near future I will get clothing sizes and gift card needs and will let everyone know where to send. Its going to be a LONG road back to normal for these families but with your help we can lighten the burden little by little. If you have any questions, please ask in the comments section and I thank you in advance for everything. May God Bless you!

                        I bought my home in 2007 when I was a full time college student working on my Associate's degree. I graduated in 2009 and continued to get my Bachelor's Degree in Social Work in 2013 and then my Master's in 2014.While I was attending graduate school, I was working part time in my field as a direct support professional for adults with traumatic brain injuries and mental health issues. Soon after graduating, I was promoted by my employer to a Program Manager for two residential group homes. I held that position for one year until we had started having a major staffing crisis and one of my houses was left with only two employees.Since the houses I managed required 24/7 care for the residents that lived there, I was forced to work over 80hrs/wk. After a few months of this, I couldn't take it anymore; the long hours were taking a toll on me both physically and mentally. I was being paid a salary for 40hrs/wk but was working well over that without additional compensation.In the end, I barely had enough time to sleep, let alone eat, shower, look for another job or spend any amount of time with my then four year old daughter. This being said, I abruptly gave my two weeks notice. I am still in the process of looking for another job and so far have only been contacted for one interview.Right now I'm in the process of attempting loss mitigation but, without current employment, it seems like this process will only benefit me by stalling things.I've made alot of improvements to my home over the 8 yrs I've owned it and would hate to lose that if we're forced to leave . More importantly, my daughter and I and out two fur babies (Gator and Taz) will have no where to go if we don't have this house. Morgen is supposed to start kindergarten in September. I'm a very independent, hardworking person (I've worked nonstop since I was 13). I'm also very stubborn and dread asking for help; however, at this point in time, I'm all out of other options and running out of time.Yesterday 2/17/16, a sheriff came to my house to serve me papers informing me that my house will be sold at a sheriff's sale on April, 7th 2016. I have until then to come with what I owe or we'll have to be out by October 7, 2016.I'm not looking for a hand-out; I know that other people have struggles worse than mine. This being said, I intend and WILL pay back any one that is able to help me save my house.If you are hesitant and have questions before you consider donating, please feel free to pm me at www.facebook.com/my.name.is.urlThank You for reading my story and Thank You for the support!!!

CLAYTON, DE                                




My name is Christy Artymenko. My brother is Steve White. Steve and his fiance Michelle Shober where in a terrible motorcycle accident on Sunday 9/18 in Quarryville, Pa. They were hit by a vehicle and thrown from their motorcycle. Both Steve and Michelle sustained life altering injuries. Steve lost 3/4 of his blood before getting to the hospital. His spleen burst, diaphragm ruptured, both wrists broke, ribs broke and detached, lungs collapsed, and vertebrae compressed. Michelle sustained numerous fractures and internal bleeding. But by God's grace they are alive and will recover! However, recovery will take months and they will not be able to work. Once Steve is out of the hospital he will be transferred to an inhouse rehab. Motorcycles were Steve's passion. He raced dirt bikes and won numerous trophies! He is a very experienced and talented rider. Steve and Michelle were meant to be together. They make each other so happy and are so in love. I couldn't be any happier than I am to have Michelle in Steve's life. Likewise, Michelle's sisters feel the same about Steve. I am raising funds to help pay for their rent, car payment, utililities and any other costs that may occur while they are unable to work. Any amount will help us pay their bills!! If you are unable to give please continue to pray for their complete recovery!!Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

SUMTER, SC                                





                        On October 4, Hurricane Jaquin brought unprecendented rainfall in the Midlands area of South Carolina. My family home, located in Sumter, suffered extensivewater damage after a nearby dam gave way and disgusting lake water flooded every room.While I was not living there, I regularly madetrips back home. There was a family wedding on Oct. 3, so my mom and grandmother were going to be out of town and she needed me to take care of our disabled cat (he's very personable, but his legs don't work).Here's my mom and our little disabled buddy:When the flood began, I immediately started putting important photo albums and electronic devices on higher ground. It quickly became obvious that the water was going to keep rising and rising, but I had nowhere to go. The front yard was replaced with a lakethat rose as high as the raised flag on our mailbox. Even if the street wasn't a stream, I'm a mostly blind guy that can not drive. So, I was stuck.Here's a look at our front & back yards, before the waterrose way higher andgot inside the house:Here's some pictures after the water first got inside the house:By the time the water was reaching wall sockets, I splashed my way to the breaker and shut everything off. I then sat on my mother's bed with her animals, listening to podcasts while I watched the water reach the previously dryhigher ground.Sometime after midnight, my neighborhood was bad enough for rescue workers to pull people from houses by boat. The rescuers would not allow pets, so I asked them to come back after getting others while I wrestled with staying vs leaving. I called my mom and she assured me that my saftey came above the cats (though it still broke her heart).I returned, by boat, as early as possible to retrieve the cats. They all thankfully survived (I put them on as high of ground as possible), though a bit in shock. My mom returned from the rain-free wedding and, after we could access the house by car, we evaluated the damage.Here's a few pictures of some immediately apparant damage:Mold already began to grow. The smell was so awful and nauseating, you had to wear a mask to enter. Everything was soaked: beds, couches, counters, dressers, clothes, carpets, appliances, photos, home videos, childhood stuffed animals, vinyl records, Christmas decorations, and more. It turns out the water reached nearly waist level.Floors were buckling, walls were growing mold, and all carpets were forever unclean, so we acted fast and hired a clean up crew to rip everything out and chemically treat the house.Instagram Video of Our Pile of Destroyed StuffHere's the gutted house:The goal is set at $22,000. We don't realistically expect to reach that amount, but I guess there has to be a substantial goal in this type of scenario. FEMA inspected the house and gave $28,000 but ServePro (the clean up crew) cost $22,000. That leaves littlefor my mom to rebuild the house, especially considering the lowest quote for reconstruction is around $30,000. Fortunately, this gofundme is not our only potential resource. A few local strangers have graciously given what they can. My brother and I also have some money saved up between us (he's a tattoo artist and my income is Social Security Disability). Sheis apprehensiveto the idea of accepting , as she puts it, our ""money for the future.""(Obviously we won't listen to her and will put what we can into reconstruction when the time comes). Also, we will continueto seek out any qualifying govenment or relief aid.As you can expect, this has been an emotionally draining time for my mother. I may be biased, but she is the greatest woman I know and she deserves a place to call home.This is all so surreal, especially for her (looking through moldy family photos isn't exactly uplifting).Any person that helps us out willforever have ourgratitude.Thank you for taking the time to read our story. This house means so much to us and we just want it back.-Alex Oldhouser

SANTA MONICA, CA                                





Camera Stolen, Replacement Greatly AppreciatedHello everyone, my name is Kyle Jetter, an aspiring photographer and filmmaker from San Diego. I have been pursuing my career in film and photography for the past 5 years, notputting one day behind me without involving film or photography in my day. Anybody in theloving community of La Jolla, which I am gratefulto call my home, could tell you how much work I put into what I do. I just can't seem to stop creatingcontent. Whetherit's filming surfing, doing commerical work, generating lifestyle videos, taking portrait photos, or anything that surrounds me, I love to incorporate anythinginto my sense of art. Here are some links to see some original work (below)Instgram - @kylejetter KyleJetter.comVimeo Flickr On a recent trip up to Santa Barbara I went to visit some friends. I decided I would just leave the camera in thecar for the weekend and maybe not take it out at such a risky place. I put it on the passenger side under theseat completelyhidden. When we cameback to the car at the end of the weekend, the camera had been stolen fromthe car. Every possibility was passed through and everyone who might have know anything was contactedbut with no information. I have always cherished all of my equipment and love to use it in a way where everyone benefits from it. It's a shame this had to happen when I just love taking photos of thisbeautiful life, and overall, just making people happy!So with everything added up I lost:Canon 6D ($1500)Rokinin 35mm f/1.5 Cine lens ($600)Sandisk 64gb card ($40)LP-E6 Battery ($25)Canon 17-40mm ($800)If my goal is reached, I can't wait to get back out in the field and really start pushing for more content. Not having a camera made me realize how much more content I should really start to create. I want to take things seriously when I have the time and be more tenacious than I have ever been pursuing this career. And for everyone who donates, it will be greatly appreciated. Whether you don't know me or you have heard of me, or if you're a friend of a friend, or a loved one, everyone is welcome to participate. This campaign is about the coming together and support of one another. I would love to offer to all those who donate a photo print of your choice, some fun personal photos of themselves, or just a huge hug and a smile.Thank you everyone. I'm really hoping to hop back on my feet and continue to start to pursuea career in film/photo up here in Los Angeles. Any donations are accepted and all kind words are appreciated. Once again, I can't explain how mucheveryones support really means to me. ""its not about how hard you can hit it about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward""Stay positive my friends! Have a great day!- Kyle Jetter

                                                            on behalf of Audrey Roberts

BOWLING GREEN, KY                                





                        Caring ones...Her name is Audrey Roberts. Although she put on my Red Sox jersey to take a picture (and to make me happy), Im pretty sure she knows little about my beloved team. I initially thought Id reach out to Red Sox Nation... those united by a common thread, but really this plea is to caring people everywhere, anyone who respects life and the rights all of us hope to have regarding where and how we live and yes, where and how we spend our final days.Id like to share a little about my dear Audrey and why she has impressed me by the way she has lived and continues to do so today.Audrey is of a generation that believed hard work, living within her means, and scrimping to save everything she could, would secure her future and provide care in her golden years. With only an eighth grade education, Audrey worked most of her life in commercial laundry as a marker and a checker and was never paid more than minimum wage. With her own money, she purchased a home for five thousand dollars and still lives in it today. Audreys one and only child, Earl, died driving home one snowy Kentucky day. He was only 21... she still grieves for him today. Her husband, John, fifteen years her senior, had many medical issues and died when he was only 70, leaving her to fend for herself.I met Miss Audrey when I was only 3 years old. Audrey was a volunteer Foster Grandparent and a great cook! This worked well for the both of us... she liked to cook and I LOVED to eat (see our picture below).Audrey would keep (babysit) me sometimes when my parents needed a get-away... and she would spoil me!We have always loved Miss Audrey, she has stood witness to me and my familys lives for over 25 years. My Mom, Lisa, and her good friend, Debbie, have worked tirelessly for years tending to Audreys needs. They have been there when she needed to go to the hospital after a fall, the subsequent physical therapy, and the hiring of caregivers for round-the-clock companionship and care. There were even times when my Mom and Debbie have been the round-the-clock caregivers.Earlier, I mentioned how impressed I am with Audrey, heres why...In her life, Audrey was able to save almost $180,000 working only for minimum wage and saving every penny she could. Audrey didnt invest in the stock market...she saved the only way she knew how, with a simple savings account.Audreys health is pretty good according to her physician, Dr. Sherryl Reed(In video below). Any of us would love this news from a well-respected doctor, but its a double-edged sword for Audrey. You see, she has quite simply outlived her money. With her social security bringing in less than $1000 a month and her savings exhausted, her future in her home is fading. The cost of caregivers is nearly $90,000 annually, not to mention medical care, food, utilities, etc.

This concern, no, this fear is that someday this could be our story. Audrey was born in 1911, one year before our beloved Fenway Park opened! Yes, thats right, Audrey will be 105 this year and all she wants is to live out her days in her own home.Our goal is to touch the hearts of people who believe dignity is vital to life. If we are not able to raise funds for Audreys care we will have no choice but to move her to a nursing home.We need to raise $100,000.00 to cover Audreys care for one more year. Please help us extend the dignity of life this amazing woman has earned and deserves... when we look into her eyes, we understand that she has put all hope in our hands... please help in any way you can.Thank you and God Bless You!

WALKERTON, IN                                




Purpose:To relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors stand for faith.After you donate please go ""like"" and combat the leftist hatred expressed on Dana's page."" https://www.facebook.com/danaradio?fref=nf https://www.facebook.com/DanaTheBlaze?fref=ts

Religious liberty is under assault in Indiana and that's never been clearer than with the O'Connor family. When asked by local press the hypothetical question of whether or not they'd prefer to have their family owned business, Memories Pizza, cater a gay wedding, the owner said no citing their own religious beliefs as the reason. Rather than allowing this family to simply have their opinion, which they were asked to give, outraged people grabbed the torches and began a campaign to destroy this small business in small town Indiana. All for having an opinion that is rooted in faith. No one was turned away. No one was discriminated against. It was a hypothetical question asked by a news reporter who had questionable motives to begin with. After being interviewed by Dana Loesch on her television show on Blaze TV, we learned that the family may never even reopen the doors to their restaurant as the death threats and vicious online reviews continue to pour in from the arbiters of ""tolerance.""My name is Lawrence Jones, and I'm one of the television opinion contributors on Dana's show. Before the televised interview, producers Rachel, Allison and George discussed the situation with Dana, myself and head writer Ben Howe. We all agreed: this family needs help to get through this assault. So we set up a GoFundMe page with the modest goal of $25,000. The intent was to help the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in. Our goal was simply to help take one thing off this family's plate as the strangers sought to destroy them. But other strangers came to the rescue and the total just keeps going up. Thank you for helping us do some good for this family who were scared and in hiding just 24 hours before this writing. All money, save whatever percentage GoFundMe takes, will be transferred directly to whichever bank account the O'Connors wish to use. Show producers are in direct contact with the family to ensure that they never feel like they are being left out of what is going on. Thank you to everyone for your generosity.

                                                            for Institute Of Christ The King Sovereign Priest

CHICAGO, IL                                




A Chicago Historic Landmark Church in FlamesOn October 7th, a fire broke out in the Shrine of Christ the King Church, on 6415 South Woodlawn Avenue in Chicago, next to the headquarters office of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest. Evidence indicate that the fire began late at night in the wooden choir loft, and quickly spread through the church. The extra-alarm fire took 150 firefighters several hours to bring under control. No one was hurt, thankfully, but substantial damage was done.Coming to church for the 8AM Mass, a mother of eight stood across the street and cried at the sight of the burning church.The fire destroyed most of the roof of the church, the entire choir loft, the windows, and most of the interior furnishings of the church. The damage from water and smoke in the rest of the church and sacristy is extensive and is still being assessed.Perhaps the most poignant moment of this tragic morning was seeing a firefighter emerge from the church, holding the Infant King in his arms, and handing it to Canon Talarico. This iconic 18th-century statue originated from Spain and graced the High Altar of the Shrine. It was a symbol of the loveliness and the divine majesty of Baby Jesus, and was adored by devotees from all over the country. Incredibly, this wooden statue was found still standing over the altar, while the roof fell in all around it, and the high heat had bent the High Altar Cross next to it. Though damaged in the fire, somehow the hope and the beauty of the Infant Christ King shone through the soot.Ironically, the present church has been undergoing restoration from the effects of a 1976 fire that consumed it. As a historical landmark, it was placed under the care of the Institute in 2004. The ensuing years have witnessed a great transformation of this formerly closed church. As the interior and the exterior of the church were slowly renovated, the congregation grew steadily, encompassing many young families who actively participated in the restoration efforts. The church also became a great asset in the neighborhood, offering concerts and social events that edified many. The Infant King devotion, centered on the historic statue, has attracted adherents from all over the country.This church was a spiritual home to many families, and it is abslutely heartbreaking to see the hardwork of the past ten years destroyed: gone are the new roof, the altars, the pews, the artwork, the familiar statues, and the exterior that took countless hours to clean and restore.Overcoming the destruction of the fire is a daunting task, yet two hopeful signs tell us, WE CAN! Emerging from the fire is the Infant King on the High Altar, still with his hand raised in blessing, and still radiant with a countenance of hope and compassion. Secondly, to be in Chicago is to be reminded always of the Windy Citys indomitable spirit of a phoenix-like rising from the ashes.This church has an aura of hope. The Canons and staff at the Shrine are fully committed to carry on the work of restoration, in spite of the devastating fire. Please donate and help restore this Chicago church; help it rise again, for the sake of the children, the families, and the neighborhood.

Bridgewater, SA                                




""Till it happens to you"" -Lady Gaga

My name is Airdre Mattner. I am from Adelaide, South Australia. I am a primary school teacher and am currently completing a contract teaching English in Japan.

It is with a heavy heart that Ifeel compelled to share my story in the hope that it will bring about much needed awareness, and ultimately justice. Justice for myself and for others who are not able to take a stand against this.

On the 25th of September while on holiday in Seoul, South Korea, I was drugged, abductedand raped. I had been holidaying with my boyfriend and friend and had decided to stay on therefor an extra few days on my own. I thought nothing of it - I have travelled overseas solo many times before.I decided to go on a pub crawl that night. I thought it would be a good opportunity to meet some new people and experience some of Seoul's nightlife in a safe environment.That night I wasdrugged, abducted, and taken in a taxi toahotel in the middle of nowhere by the man who later raped me.

I recallpleading withthe taxi driver to take me to my hostel. He ignored me and continued driving under the instruction of the man next to me.

The next thing I recall is being on a bed in a hotel room. The man was on top of me. I struggled and tried to push him away but was again tooheavily druggedto manage anything.I woke up the next morning completely naked. All my money was gone. My clothes and belongings were torn andstrewn across the room. 

WhenI managed to get to a police station, I reported the crime with the help of the hostel manager where I was staying, and a friend. For the next 10 or so hours I was sent back and forth between the hospital and police sections of the building.

I was subjected to numerous invasive treatments and tests, including having two women examine and take evidence from my bodywhile my legs were in stirrups and a curtain was in front of me to block my view. I was still in shock and feeling the effects of whatever I had been drugged with. 

I later found out to my horrorthat the staff did not follow proper Rape Precedures and no DNA evidence was collected from my body.I then spent hours giving a statement and recountingwhat had happened. I gave a detailed description of theman. I made it clear that I had never seen or met him before. I was questioned in an often very insulting manner. I insisted that I had not simply passed out from being drunk, that I hadbeen drugged. Igave them details about the pub crawl, bars and hotel I had been taken to.

They concluded with telling me that they would pass on my medical results as soon as they were released, and they would update me on every step of the investigation via email, as I was due to return to Japan the next day.

The next morning, I received a friend request on Facebook. I knew immediately that it was the man who had drugged and raped me. His face will now be burnt into my brain for the rest of my life. I immediately took screen shots of his photos and name and emailed them to the police. They acknowledged this email but did not respond to any of my questions about my results or the case.

For the next month I received no communication from the police in Seoul. No medical results. Nothing.I began to fear that I had some kind of deadly STD and this was why they had not gotten back to me. Eventually, after involving numerous Australian consulates (in Japan and Seoul), they were able to obtain my medical results. I was told that the police had decided the man who I sent them screenshots of wasn't a suspect because their records ""showed"" that he wasn't in the country at the time. After getting the report I found ithad been falsified. Staff had written on official documentsthat I had presented saying I had been too drunk and became unconscious and didn't remember anything thathad happened.

For the next few months, I lockedmyself in my room back at my apartment in Japan and used all my sick leave. Eventually I went back to work. I havesurvived on a cocktail of anti depressants, anxiety medication, sleepingtabletsand thankfully, the love and support of those around me.

It has now beennearly 6months. I am still on medication and still have trouble sleeping, with ongoing nightmares and panic attacks. The police, to this day, have done no investigations except for collecting CCTV footage from the hotel where the crime happened, however they have since done nothing with this footage.

We have since found outthat the man who raped meis living in London and working for the Metropolitan Police.

After losing all faith in the police and justice system in Korea, my family and I have decided to pursue justice in London. In May 2016 we will return to Korea to collect the CCTV footage and other evidence and information for this pursuit. We will also meet with a witness who was harassedby the same man two days prior to the incident, and who wants to provide evidence that he was definitely in the country at the time, and had messagedher of his intentions to go to a partyin Hongdae on Thursday, the day after I was attacked in the same area on Friday.My motherand I will then need to fly to London to meet with lawyers thereand begin the long and expensive process of takinglegal action.The prevalence of incidents like this, especially involving foreign tourists in Seoul, is sickening. It is horrifying how easy it is to fall victim to men like this who specialise in preying on women in such a calculated and targeted manner.

According to the Korea Herald:""For any person, becoming a victim of sexual violence is the worst fear come true. But for foreigners living in Korea, it can have an added level of fear. Language barriers, a lack of information on available services, and the less than stellar reputation of the police all complicate an already terrifying ordeal.""



""In 2011, 22,034 rapes were reported, according to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Of those, 18,591 cases resulted in arrests with a total of 18,880 offenders being convicted. However, only 12 percent of those found guilty, or 2,289, were sentenced to jail time. ""



""It is impossible to know the true number of victims in Korea, let alone the number of foreign victims, as many who are attacked  Korean or foreign  do not report the crime. Based on a 2010 survey by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, it is believed that the sexual crime reporting rate in Korea is about 10 percent...Reasons vary from victim to victim, but some foreign victims say they didnt report their case because they didnt believe the police would do anything to help them, while others refrained out of shame or guilt."" http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130423001036- used with permission from Emma Kalka, journalist.



It would mean the world to me if you could help me by sharing this campaign to help spread awareness and donating if it is within your capability. Every dollar counts. It is going to be an expensive, invasive and time-consuming journey, but it is one that I want to take so that I can finally move on withmy life knowing that this man cannot assault any other women. 

Your donations will go towards funding trips to both Korea and London for myself, the witness and my Mother, ongoing medication and treatment and counselling, and legal representation and related fees in London. I do not expect the target to be reached - Gofundme does not require this for donations to be used. Every dollar will go towards this cause.

I can only hope that this will set an example for women everywhere who find themselves in similar situations daily. I want to fight. For myself, my loved oneswho have already come forward as survivors but were notable to pursue,report or take action on the crime they experienced, and those all over the world who fall victim to this heinous crime every day. Let'sstand up, make a noise, and show that thesemonsters can be made accountable,and this horrifying cycle can be stopped.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------A postscript from my mother to all other mothers  My heart constantly bleeds for the pain and trauma suffered by my daughter  it is unimaginable that your darling loved daughter could have this happen to them. To every other mother reading this know that all the love in the world cannot stop the evil of what some have done, but all the love in the world can make us stronger and together we must bring an end to the appalling sexual violence that is rape.

                        Hi everyone! My name is Dylan Miksis, and I am one of three brothers. My older brother Jonathan is 21 years old, and a Psychology major at Boston College. My younger brother Adam is 17 and an upcoming senior at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School. He currently works as an EMT for two volunteer rescue squads in the area where we live. After school, he aspires to be a Paramedic. I am 19 years old and a Business Management major at Union County College.I have created this GoFundMe on behalf of our uncle and caretaker, Anthony DiFrancesco.Tony needsour help. We have endured a lot of tragedy in our past, including the passing of both our parents, Michelle and David Miksis. Since our parents died, our uncle Tony has been taking care of us for the past 7 years and recently has been straddled with financial burdens he is unable to fix. It has left him very depressed and recently we found out that we may lose our home very soon as the creditors have come to warn us. Our father David, was a very good man. He was a fundraiser for the United Childrens Fund, which is a charity that works for childrens rights, survival, development and protection. He always put others in front of himself. He passed away on January 5th, 2001 due to a pneumonia.Our mother, Michelle was an amazing person. She was a fighter, and in my heart she will be forever known as my greatest inspiration. After the passing of our father, our mother was right there with my brothers and me every step of the way. My uncle Tony moved into our home to help our mother (his sister) and was there to support us and help wherever he could. My mother was disabled and couldnt walk properly without a cane or brace so whenmy uncle worked 7 am to 5 pm shifts every day, my brothers and I took the responsibility of taking care of her. We missed our dad but ur family unit was still intact. We were young and in school but together we made it duable. We cleaned the house, mowed the lawn, did our own laundry, and cooked. Then, in March of 2009, my mom passed away suddenly. I can remember that day like nothing else. That day my brothers and uncle stood together, and cried. We were shocked, devastated and didn't know what to do. Not many kids would know what to do in that situation.The day our mother passed away was the start of us living with our uncle Anthony (Tony). My uncle didnt question his new role. He knew what he had to do and despite his grief and shock became our legal guardian and caretaker. Tony tries his best, and my brothers and I are very grateful. He took us under a circumstance in which he never thought would happen; the passing of his sister. He works at Westfield Lumber in the paint department, and is respected and loved by plenty of customers and his coworkers. He has suffered major heart problems in the past 4 years incurring huge medical bills and now has a defibrillator. His salary cannot cover all the expenses and in the past few years we have struggled to put food on the table and pay the bills. When my brothers and I were young and going through the high school years, Tony did receive some governmental, financial child support help. This amount was around $800 per child. This helped supplement tonys salary but once Jonathan and I graduated high school, the benefits stopped. Once Adam graduates in June of 2017, any government support is finished. This support was what helped keep us out of financial trouble. You see...Tonys salary has never been able to keep up with the expenses of living in NJ and supporting three children. But this is where his job is...where our home is. Our family has been struggling with bills and general necessities for the past 5 years. My uncle has a large amount of debt which he can no longer manage. He feels like he has failed us, and its depressing to see him this way. . He went from a happy man; a man with a mission to help his sister and make sure the kids will be safe and secure, to someone who bears the weight of failure. We dont think he has failed us and we are desperate to help him.We are currently at the point where the bills are too much, to the point of where we cant even buy groceries. We spend an average of $30 a week to feed 3 people. His salary is just over the level where we cant apply for food stamps. And now we just received a notice that eviction from our home is not far off. We risk losing our house because Tony is behind in the mortgage payments and they want to foreclose on the house. He has done so much for us and we cant believe this is happening. Please help. We are very thankful for all the help we have received through various charities like the Gateway Foundation, and personal family friends helping us along the way. They have done things that will never be forgotten:: helping us buy clothes, getting school supplies, etc. I hope this wasnt too much, and if you read it all, Id like to thank you. This is something that is hard to talk about with friends, and even strangers. Everything helps, and the Miksis boys all say thank you. We just want to stay in our home and help our uncle. Thank you for your consideration!!

Due to the current political climate in Venezuela, along with the strained US-Venezuelan relationship, this placed him in political danger. A couple of weeks after arriving there, on Thursday, June 30, 2016, he was followed by the police to his home, where the police allegedly uncovered assault rifles and other military items. He was subsequently arrested, under suspicion of conspiring against the Venezuelan government.Due to the history of political prisoners being used as propaganda to promote the Venezuelan government's ideals,and knowing Josh's character, capacity to do good, and inability to do harm, we are thoroughly convinced that the evidence was planted and the process was rigged. He has never published nor expressed any desire to conspire against the Venezuelan government. It is disgusting that the Venezuelan government has chosen to use him as a form of propaganda.Any donation is greatly appreciated, as the leagal system (abroad) is very expensive. Any donation will go towards bringing our Joshua home.Our thoughts and prayers are with you, Josh, and we will do everything we can to bring you safely home.We love you Josh!

LAKE PLACID, FL                                





                        Dear Family and Friends,Three days ago, two of our dear Haitian team members were in a serious accident in St. Marc, Haiti. They were picking up mattresses for kids at our children's home when a vehicle from the Red Cross lost control, spun around, and hit our truck broadside. The cab of the truck was smashed beyond repair and our beloved head nanny's hip socket was broken as the cab crushed in on her. While we are horrified by this experience, we are so thankful that our precious friends, Nick and Sony, are still alive. In April, our ministry's pickup truck was involved in another accident and severely damaged. The insurance process in Haiti is long and complicated and fraught with problems. They still have not given us permission to have it fixed and it is currently unusable. Now we are completely without transportation for our community, staff, and (above all) the 51 precious children in our care - making it extremely difficult to visit the market, pickup propane, and transport children to doctors appointments and other events. But the need for transportation runs much deeper than the impact on our daily life. Cabaret Haiti Mission has been serving the community of Bercy, Haiti for nearly twenty years. We are a warm and loving refuge for children without parents and we are deeply connected to the people in the area we serve. Our director, Mike Snider, not only provides care for the children and staff, but serves as 'ambulance' driver for everyone nearby in any need. In Haiti, public services are minimal and there are no emergency services at all. Everything from heart attacks to new babies to broken bones and severed limbs come to our doors, day or night. Our two now broken vehicles have taken Papa Mike"" into the remotest regions and densest places as he served the people he loves on behalf of CHM. Countless lives have been saved and pain alleviated because the Bercy ambulance has been there. Our 50,000 dollar goal will enable us to replace both the trucks and cover the medical needsof Sony, our head nanny. To those of you who have visited us and fallen in love with Haiti, we ask you to help us meet this need. By helping us replace these vehicles you are not only enabling us to operate more efficiently and effectively, but you are literally providing the means of life saving transport for countless people who are completely unable to access health care and emergency help. In Haiti it is often said that many hands lighten the load. You may not be able to give all, but what you can give will make a mighty difference in the daily life of some amazing children and incredible staff and will have a powerful, life saving impact on many lives.*Cabaret Haiti Mission is a registered 501(c)3. All gifts are tax deductible.

                        Hello my name is Ashley. My husband Chris was in a bad motorcycle accident 09/16/2016 while on his way to work. We really hate that it has come to this to ask for help but we have hit a veryrough patch from the crash. Anyone who knows us knows we care very much about our pride so when we have to ask for help like this it's very embarrassing and takes a big blow to our dignity. Chris is the sole provider for our family of 9. Our children areKalei who is 15 yrs old,Anthony who is 14 yrs old, Christopher who is 13 yrs old,Krystal who is 11 yrs old, Billy who is 8 yrs old,Christian who is 2 yrs old andAshton who is1 yrs old. Chris works as a semi truck driver so with the injuries he received they make it difficult to return to work as soon as we would like and need. The injuries he got from the accident are a concussion, broken righteye socket, both shoulders dislocated and the worst one that affects his job is a closed fracture of greater tuberosity of right humerus that he had to have surgery to put 2 screws in to fix on 09/21/2016. He will be out of work for 12 weeks. We have full coverage insuranceon his Harley that we thought would be a safety net and cover lost wages if anything ever happened but we are now informed they do not cover lost wages and only cover up to $20,000.00 in medical bills. With the ambulance from accident scene, 2 xrays, 2 CT scans, ER visit,surgery, doctor office visits, medication and now physical therapy when able to after healing with surgery, I assume we are going to hit the medical bills cut off.We have called around for a week to see what assistance we can get for our bills (mortgage, electric, gas, water etc.)from the government, churches, relief programs and everyone is out of funds or want to wait til we are losing our house or have shut off notices that they can't guarantee us they will evenpay if they get that far. With children in the house along with animals it's a scary thought to know how bad this will get in the next few weeks. Not only do we have to worry about food or bills but the next 3 months of missed workwill have 3 of our children's birthdays along with holidays that we won't be able to provide for them on. Any donations would be appreciated to help us through these next few months. Any other programs you are aware of that could help us would be appreciated too. Thank you!!

SPRING VALLEY, MN                                





                        This morning at 7 a.m. my Aunt Kelly hellickson and Rusty hellickson were called by a neighbor that there was black smoke coming from their house.  After my uncle Rusty got home, he called 911 when he found that his home that his family built was on fire and their dogs were inside. After the fire was put out, we were so gracious that one of the dogs was able to get the door open and both dogs were able to make it out and are safe but their house is totally lost.  Kelly, Rusty, and they're three boys, Jessie hellickson, Ian hellekson and Tanner hellickson, who volunteers for the fire department and also got the call, have lost their home and everything in it. The rest of them Kelly and Rusty and their boys are known to the community and are always willing to help each other out. We are setting up this for them because they were left nothing and are devastated by the loss of their 14 year-old home with all their memories. Any little bit helps and is gratefully appreciated.

                        Hello, and thank you for taking a minute to read this important message. First things first,FloScope.tv and FloScope, is a project for and about humanity, and the magnificent world we live in. Ever feel like there has to be a better way? In a world which is so technologically advanced, and seemingly shrinking for humanity on a daily basis...did you ever think...there is something wrong or lacking? That humanity, and the way things are now, need to change? Well so do we. This project is about presence, joy, love and leading a better way. If you haven't yet had the chance, watch one of our daily broadcasts on FloScopeplease click here: http://periscope.tv/claesgens(aka FloScope)and see for yourself. The Morning Wake Up daily broadcast, a pattern interrupt, is meant to inspire joy, awe and love, to start the day off perfect, or to interupt and get things moving in the right direction. The Moment of Joy broadcasts, or even our Health Scopes, are meant to use the very technology that seems to drive us so far apart, to bring us together, in the present, for the sake of just being. We do not sell advertising, nor have any business in mind, other than the peaceful, internal, global revolution of humankind, human civilization, ethics and joy. That is why we need your help and support. Please give whatever support that you can, to assist this important cause for and about humanity. Want to learn more, read on below...heard enough, then do your part to contribute to our mission and to humanity itself.Please allow me to introduce myself, and a project I believe is worth learning about. My name is Sean Claesgens, I am real, ethical, joyful, and human. I live in Florida, USA. I am a proud father and have 4 awesome beautiful children...Tara (16), Sean II (13), Dylan (6) and Luca (4). I am a leader, visionary, entrepreneur, consultant and coach. Because of my experiences and unique perspective, I have dedicated my life to creating change and civilization in and for humanity. My primary project and main purpose for raising these monies, is to support and fund a very important mission I founded called FloScope.tv.  http://FloScope.tv FloScopeis a project for and about humanity, and the magnificent world we live in. FloScope was launched in May of 2015. Since then, I have broadcasted live every day (with the rare exception of possibly one or two) on Periscope.tv (Periscope is a live and interactive internet video streaming application owned and integrated into Twitter, in case you don't know). My scope/channel, so to speak, is  http://periscope.tv/claesgensI hope you will check it out.In order to give a better understanding of why I am asking for your participation with mein this way, I would like to give a bit of background information. Since as early as I can remember, I have had a few seemingly unique abilities: my ability to communicate, relate, and connect deeply and compassionately with others. At various different points in my life, I have pursued different interests that allowed me to express these talents, and always it has been magnificent to see. Early on, it became clear to me that I was here for something important, something bigger than me, and to help people deeply. Throughout my life at all ages, people have come to me, and what I have found is that Ihelp them significantly. I have come face to face with my destiny several times, and it was frightening.  From the age of 15 until the age of 40, I was exceptionally successful and independent. I was advanced in school, graduating quite early, I got into business and immediately found success. I have built several projects and businesses, from the ground up.  I have held the position of top manager, up to Senior Executive in other's businesses as well.  I didn't come from a wealthy family, so everything I've built I have created from scratch. Each time I have built successful projects though, they have left me feeling empty. All along I knew that there was a higher purpose, something more I would and should be doing. In my 30s I focused a lot of my attention on personal growth and introspection. Simultaneously, several events in the world , such as the war in Iraq, the 9/11 attacks, and other acts of violence and aggression deeply disturbed me. At that point, I decided that the world may be in deep trouble, and so might humanity. I invested very deeply... many dollars and tens of thousands of hours and effort, exploring myself, working on myself and working with others. I became a life coach, an ethicist and a facilitator in a human growth and potential program, and I was successful. Not in the traditional way of earning a lot of money, but in helping many people, changing and improving lives and businesses. It was the most on purpose I had ever been, but the potency scared me and the temptation of more traditional success took me in a different direction. I struggled trying to figure out how to survive, leading a more ethical life, in an unethical system. Then at the age of 40, I hit a low point in my life. I was off purpose. Again very successful in business, but I was conflicted due to the lack of ethics. With financial success and its temptations, I was spiritually at a low point. I slipped down the rabbit hole of addiction. I really struggled, had some horrible experiences, and created a lot of havoc in my life, but kept up with the financial success and made that the highest priority...all in the name of ""taking care of"" my family. In February 2013, I hit rock bottom and for the first time met with failure in business. In fact, I was failing everywhere. I experienced the reality of what it meant to live off of my purpose, in a system without ethics. Slowly but surely, I lost everything, and when I say everything, I mean everything. There, at the lowest point of my life, I made some serious decisions and significant life changes. This is where I began an entirely new way of life.  I knew as it was happening that this was the universe's way of saying ""hey did you forget your destinty?"" What I had found though was the greatest gift, it was me. In my sobriety, and clear perspective I saw the obvious. I decided through this process, that no matter what, I could no longer participate in the traditional system. Our non-ethical world does not lend itself to upholding one's ethics, and doesn't leave a lot of choice from my perspective. But being who I am, I do not give up easily. I decided that I would rebuild again from the ground up, only this time differently, with full ethics, and mindfullness. Through my experiences, I finally accepted the handwriting on the wall...that I could run but could not hide from my purpose and what is meant to be. The more I uphold my ethics in today's world, the tougher it is. True joy has begun to fill my heart as I realize the unique opportunity my life has created...or was destined to be. Meanwhile, given all of these circumstances my resolve and commitment to live ethically has multiplied magnificently. That is why I started FloScope.tv. You see, I have had a belief since a very early age, that a very significant change and shift in the consciousness of humanity is not only possible, but hopefully near. But if we don't rise up to this occassion, we are likely to destroy ourselves completely, perhaps even ending humanity. It is my belief that we live in a unique and perhaps supremely significant time for humanity. We have rapidly advancing, ever increasing technology, we have globalization which has shrunk the world significantly, we have a diverse set of cultures and an awesome opprtunity to raise ourselves. The next step in human civilization and advancement for humanity is occurring simultaneously as we have one of the darkest times of our existence. Objectification and a ""might is right"" model has hit a peak. People are caught in a system of materialism, with little ability to create a change. Even if they did realize it, most are to busy trying to survive and worrying about protecting themselves from threats real and perceived. That is a real juxtaposition I believe. I also happen to believe that people for the most part are good.  I believe endlessly in each and every person very deeply. I think that what has happened is that we have found ourselves with a lack of ethics. That is to say, that the vast majority of people are non-ethical. They are habitual beings with herd mentality, not questioning what might be right or wrong, and moving through the world non-mindfully. I am not naive enough to think that there are not a very few who are ethical, which is what I strive for and live my life to be. I also recognize that it is likely that there are some who are actually unethical and very destructive and harmful to humanity. However, I believe that for the most part people are good, and are just disintegrated and cannot see. I think that people are always doing the best they can. Leave it at this, I will forever believe in humanity. That being said, I believe we must make a change, a shift in the consciousness of humanity both collectively and individually. I do not want to live in a world where the highest value is a quarterly statement of profits, one where terrorism is the only outlet that an oppressed people see. So that brings me to this point. Someone has to lead, to be the change we want to see. I not only have dedicated my life to ethics and living mindfully, but to leading this charge and change in humanity. I believe and will not waiver in my belief that we can grow and rise above.Enter FloScope.tv, with the daily Morning Wake Up broadcasts to display the beautiful world we live in and spread the mission joyfully. A daily pattern interrup. Once I have interrupted the pattern and grabbed the attention of the viewer I speak to them very frankly. What we need is a peaceful revolution, internally and globally. I am here to assemble and lead that charge...it has started with me. Now accumulating over 1000 followers (no advertising, just daily broadcasts and me) and over 500,000 hearts/likes, it is obvious to me that I am not the only one who is ready. That brings me to this, my request for some financial assistance, my straight out plea. I ask you to support the mission. I have a vision, a plan and I am ready. The project is now growing quite rapidly and in reality, it takes money. That is why I made this page, this appeal for your contribution to help me, and to help all of us. What you can expect is that I will account for and use every penny ethically. I will be mindful with every dollar and use it for the purpose of building this important project for the benefit and betterment of humanity. A couple of last thoughts. I do not participate in unethical or non ethical systems which adds a lot of complexity and challenges for me. I do not discriminate in any way, I believe in and want to help all of humanity. I have dedicated my life to this and I am honored to have this opportunity. Your support and contribution no matter how small, might just make the difference which ultimately saves us, and the magnificent world we live in. I will continue to work on my growth, my self and my ethics eternally. I will never quit until I die to work for, uphold and build on humanity, human ethics, civilization and what it is to be human. Thank you for your consideration and for anything you can contribute to this magnificent project. I am honored and feel very privileged that my life, my existence, has led me to this very opportunity which I take very seriously. Make today amazing, join our community, and join in this revolution of sorts, and remain awesome eternally.

                        My brother Kevin Unverzagt died in an accident while riding his bike home from work on July 25, 2016. It was tragic and our family is saddened by this sudden loss, especially for his nearly 6-year-old son Jakob.By Kevin's own description he was a single dad ""who works hard so my son & I can play hard."" He was also a cancer survivor and a fitness geek. Kevin liked to help people, but he struggled to get by. He was making good progress in his life and recently became a registered medical assistant. However, he did not have life insurance or any savings. Many of his friends are worried about what this will mean for Jacob. There are many people that love him and he's with a stable family for now, but we want to help ensure that he has the resources to continue to grow and develop into the young man his father wanted him to.So, we are asking for your help with Jakob's long-term expenses. Any money received from this campaign will beused only for Jakob.Thank you to everyone who has expressed their love, condolences for Kevin, and their concern for Jakob.

Aya Grows



The city of East St. Louis, Illinois, is notoriously chronicled throughout the press. I speak to you as co-founder and Chief Executive Dreamer of Aya Grows, a local nonprofit, authentic storyteller for I Am East St. Louis, the Magazine, artist, yogi, anthropologist, and human being. My partner, Andre', is our Chief Creative Engineer, an activist, mathmetician, passionate leader, and more. We speak from a place of authenticity, adaptibility, and awareness. 

Historically, East St. Louis has been burdened exponentially by environmental and social injustices - such as industrial exploitation and systemic discrimination, culminating in the 1917 Race Riots. We are more than the crimes committed against us. We have a legacy for producing great scholars, leaders, artists, writers, musicians, and athletes. We are not notorious: We are legendary. We believe in collective human ingenuity  the power of our talents realized in conscious solidarity. We strive to invest in this collective by investing in personal empowerment, community solidarity, and environmental enrichment. After graduating, my partner and I started Aya Grows, a nonprofit investing in these three key variables and focusing on environmental enrichment. The Garden of Harmony began as a two-story red house, where our friend lived. It was torn down and became a vacant lot, filled with hazardous trash and tall grasses. We bought the lot and over the past year we have used a community based design model to create a flower and produce garden, a fire pit, a picnic table, and a place to be.Down the street is another vacant lot  a makeshift shrine serves as memorial to the lives stolen in this space. The community wants to transform it into a memorial basketball court. We want to see that that dream realized. Beyond the vacant lots are vacant buildings. At one point, it was estimated that forty percent of our city was vacant or abandoned. This is because of rapid industrialization followed by industrial pullout, partnered with tense social conflicts fueled tremendously by labor, ethnic, and political divides. Rapid deindustrialization destroyed our tax base and our population dramatically declined. Now, we rebuild  rooted in a new paradigm of awareness, authenticity, and adaptability.We are a manifestation of the global awakening of conscious culture. It is our responsibility to cultivate and support this change. We are planning two more vital civic projects: Aya City House and Aya Sanctuary Lounge. The City House will house our offices, space for small classes, and a wellness boutique. This will allow us to have a headquarters, strengthening our impact. The Sanctuary Lounge will offer live entertainment, fresh and local cuisine, a library, delicious drinks, display local art, and much more. We need a place where community leaders can come together to network, brainstorm, and build. We have big dreams and, in East St. Louis, there is no limit  not even the sky.We are reaching out to you because we believe that you are a dreamer too. We believe that you are a person with a mission. We believe that you are ready to make an investment that will change everything  through personal empowerment, community solidarity, and environmental enrichment. Believe in us, in our mission. The time to act is now. Your contributions, quite literally, will change everything. Your support will help us provide our city with places to invest in each other. Your help allows us to transform dreams into realities. This is larger than life.

A thank you, dear friends, is not enough  and, at this point, it is all we have. That, and the lot pictured above is now a beautiful and blossoming urban green space.Goal: $25,000  invest in collective human ingenuity.-Aya City House: Office & Meeting, Education & Exploration, Residential Living-Aya Sanctuary Lounge: Fresh & Local Cuisine, Live Entertainment, Art & Books, Community & Connection-Aya Grows: Vacant Lot TransformationThank you, Peace and Love,Linze and Andr AyaVisit Our Website to Learn More

From the Cortez Journal: Search for missing snowmobiler turns into recovery effort Ron Sr. has been mounting a costly recovery-effort at his own expense to bring his boy home to the family and friends that love him so much. These efforts have been made even more difficult, and expensive, as storms move through Colorado and the ice thickens on Groundhog Reservoir.To help Ron and his family in this most difficult time, we have taken up collections around the office but we would like to extend the opportunity to contribute to an effort to give back to the family of an Air Force veteran and beautiful soul. The search and recovery costs are mounting beyond what anyoneshould have to burden alone. For this reason, we are are setting up this GoFundMe account as a way for friends and family to show their love and support for our incredible friend Ron who means the world to us. Ron has been a friend and mentor to so many in his hometown of Katy, Texas and in the international Oil and Gas exploration community that it would mean so much to his family to let them know that they are not alone in their loss.Please, keep in mind that no donation is too small and all are deeply appreciated. Together we can provide tremendous financial relief for Ron and his family.

When i was 8 i was on a motorcycle with my dad, and it was our only means of transportation. We were hit by a car driven by a man late for a WIC appointment running a red light. My dad only suffered a sprain ankle, but i was pinned to the car and dragged several blocks until i flew off the car and into a tree. My family was told that IF i survived i would be severely retarded or a vegetable. With my dad suffering from extreme guilt ""nothing was his fault"", he committed suicide. Because i had on a helmet i survived but under very harsh circumstances. I severed my spine and have been a paraplegic ever since, also loosing the ability to sweat and cannot handle heat or i will have a heat stroke.


The van i currently have it constantly brakes down on us or needs repairs has torn up floor causes wheelchair to slide, AC & Heater unrepairedable and a whole lot more issues.


I'm very positive with an awesome sense of humor about life. All that i want is a van accessible for myself and to get to appointments and go places with my loved ones.


Please repost my GoFundMe me and take a moment to push all of the energy that you can my way and to my cause. Maybe with enough we can somehow get the ball rolling to reach my goal.


Thank you
Angelo

I am raising money for my mom because she along with my two younger brothers (2 years old and 11 years old) suffered an unfortunate house fire and lost their home as of Tuesday Sept. 20, 2016.   My mom and brothers have nowhere to go, i myself dont own a house or anywhere to call my own at the moment so i am not able to provide them with what they need. Everything in the house is either destroyed or seiverly damaged and it turns out that the insurance does not cover any personal damage.  The money will be used to help replace what was lost in the fire such as clothing, food, and a place to stay. Anything is fine, whether the donation is big or small it will be greatley apreciated. My mom has always helped me out no matter what and now she has nothing and with two small children to still look after so this is my way of helping her.  The funds will be needed soon is possible. Theirs no rush but the sooner the better. I will be extremely thankful to those who help me and my family in this most difficult time. Thank you all so much for everything you do for me and my family. You are with out a doubt giving them the gift of hope.

I am already doing said work but I am at a point in my life where I want to take the next step in my career as a speaker and create greater change within society. Now that I have been chosen for this unique program, I need every bit of help I can get to make this transformation happen. It costs $8000 and I've been able to scrounge up roughly $3000. I am asking on my community to help me out with the rest of the $5000.

I will come up with a way to pay you back/ reward you/appreciate you somehow!!

Hard Ships Through Out My Life.          I am 24 years old. Ihave been an underdog my whole life and have come a very long way. My hardships taught me how to reach for my dreams. I have been told; that I wasnt college material. I would never make anything happen with my dance career, and I am too risky and waste my money on traveling and . I knew better than to believe these lies. I came to realize that my greatest superpower continues to be my belief in me.I have known hardships and found the courage to tackle many obstacles in my path. I dont believe in giving up, I am meant for so much more in this life. My greatness echoes in each and every breath which form my living soul.

My Experience as a Speaker.           Ive had training under the 1999 World Champion of Public Speaking Craige Valentine and the acclaimed speaker, Les Brown(said to be top 5 bestotivational speakers in the world). I have been a part of Toastmasters for a year and a half now; being the Vice President of Public Relations and Marketing for one year. Within that time I have already accomplished my Competent Communicator and Competent Leadership awards. I am a member within two clubs, and have won numerous awards within each of those clubs. I want teach my fellow man how to deal with stress, get rid of excuses and do what is to make their dreams a living reality. I have been fortunate to have a lot of people in my life to take their time and energy in helping me achieve my dreams.

My Experience as a Business Owner.            I've owned my own business through out college and have learned so much from the expirience. My mentor,Bud Jones, has taught me a lot on a very consistant basis the last few years. Multiple times a week, every week, for the last few years. He was a policeman, owned 2 grocery stores, owned a pub, and was the Vice President for a solar company. He currently owns his own online business, which I am apart of and colaborate with.

I want to thank you for your time in reading this letter. This is undoubtedly one of the best opportunities for me to launch my career as a motivational speaker and entreprenuer.

                        My boyfriend Garrett was injured Tuesday in a lineman accident. Garrett isn't the type of person that will let you know when he needs something, but unfortunately bills can't go on hold. He isn't aware of this being made for him, due to the fact that he needs to heal and not worry about bills. Any amount is very appreciated and will go towards his pain and suffering. We plan to use what is raised to pay bills and for gas to future appointments. Thank you all so much for whatever you are able to donate and we appreciate the prayers!

We are having a very difficult time paying bills and even grocery shopping. I am very embarrassed to ask for help, and we have had wonderful help, but it only lasts so long. Libby's funeral has been planned. It is $8,350. I am splitting costs with her father as we are divorced. We are now having to move once Libby passes because I am unable to pay rent. Our landlords are letting us stay until she passes, but then we have to pack up and leave. I am at a loss. The stress is unreal. Im sorry to ask, but if there is anything anyone can do, we would greatly appreciate it. www.atcp.org

                        Please, Please, Please help us save our children! My name is Melissa Lynes, my husband and I have a blended family with three children and we love them all dearly! We have a story to tell and are asking for as much help as possible to help with lawyer fees to get a protective order and modify preexisting court orders, as we are getting no where with the judicial system and things are beginning to become time sensitive. This story is gross, heart-wrenching and stomach turning. We want you to know to please read at your own risk as we have had to also personally seek therapy after everything we've been through. We are running out of money for that also. At this point we are already $15,000 into this and the hole is only growing largerand we have another court hearing next week and our attorney is asking for more money.In May of this year (2016), I walked into my daughters (6) room to find her laying on her belly and my son (3 at the time) putting a toy thermometer into her vagina. I of course freak out on the inside but know I have to hold my composure, so I immediately separted the two of them and spoke with them both one on oneto see why they were doing what I had just seen, neither of them would talk. I call my husband in hysterics (he's on his way to work), he comes home immediately. We sat and spoke about the matter and knew we needed to get answers. After talking with the children we learned the beginning of where this started. We drove to the police department five hours away where it happened and made a report. While waiting in the lobby for officers to arrive the children were playing on their tablet and watchig videos. We asked them to turn it off because of the noise. They continued watching their video so we took the tablet to turn it off... Pushed stop on the video and then preview screens popped up of other videos on the device. Oh My God, what we saw was the worst thing any parent ever wants to see... The 3 and6 year old at the time were making child pornography on their tablet! We immediately handed it over to the police. We went to CAC and interviews were done with the children. After whichthe police and CPS basically told us nothing was going to happen because the children didn't say ""enough"". Over the next two weeks my daughter had been coming out more about the situation in which she talked to her school counselor and a nurse at a hospital. Wehad then learned there was full on sexual abuse happening. After another visit to CAC the children were interviewed again, and a little more come out to the police. We were then taken to hospital for a SANE exam, my daughter told the nurses even more of the sexual abuse. After this we were told the police were moving forward with the investigation and filing charging, a few days later they changed their story and said get a lawyer and file forchanges to preexisting court orderbecause we are not able to work this case. So here we are four months later with two young children who have come forward about being sexually assaulted, with physical evidence, 7 ""cryouts"" to people who are supposed to matter in a case like this including a PHD therapist, Nurses, CPS investigator, school counselor, the detective working the case, drawings by my daughter showing the abuse, etc, and we have been in court for two full days and had three testimonies from counselors and investigators and stillthe person resposible was given unsupervised visitation while we recess for next court date. We are at wits end, our court date is in a week and it appears it defenitly will not be the last one because the other party has family who are funding his lawyer, who is dragging it out as long as possible. We are only in the court proceeding for the protective order with days if not months to go and still have another whole court case forchanging preexisting court ordersto go. We paid our lawyer in full a contracted amount in the beginning for both protective order andchanging of preexisting court ordersand now we are told we have to double the contract just to continue the protective order fight due to the other lawyer dragging it out.I own a small business and all my resources are being drained completely, my credit limit is maxxed out, and between therpy for two children weekly and twice weekly for myself, as well as the mounting legal fees I am tapped out. I never have been in this position before to where I have to ask anyone for help but I don't have a choice. With the financial backing of the other parties family paying for their defense I am not able to compete. Originally we were told it should be over swiftly due to the amount of evidence but now like everything else with this matter its looking impossible. There is much more evidence and fact to this matter but do to ongoing court matters I can't disclose everything. Long story short we need help.We greatly appreciate any help that is offered to us. We will never be able to express our gratitude. Melissa Lynes

                        I am Sarah, Tanya's sister and we are trying to raise money to help her after she was in a terrible accident July 14th. On this day her and her grandson were in the vehicle with her now ex-boyfriend. An arguement insued and people reported seeing him punching her in the face before the crash. He told her he was going to kill her and drove the car into a tree. The car hit another vehicle, causing the car to flip and ejecting my sister from the car. Her grand baby suffered minor scrapes but was pulled from the car by someone at the scene and is okay. The ex at this point ran leaving my sister lying on the ground to die. My sister was life flighted to a trauma center and the first 7 hour surgery was an attempt to reattach her scalp which was ripped off as she went through the window. The surgery was unsuccessful. She has also suffered with an compound fracture to her femur and wrist, broken ribs, left lung collapsed, shattered tailbone, and a portion of her face including the right ear was ripped off, a surgery to attempt to save the ear was also unsuccessfuland she has lost the majority of her right ear. The doctor told us she will need many surgeries for the rest of her life. Skin grafts as soon as she has enough healed skin to perform these procedures. This money is to help her in everyway we can, we are trying to get help with medical bills but she has lost everything. She will be in the hospital for weeks to months and will have no home to go to when she gets out and no car. This will mean so much to all of us because we need to know she will be okay once out of the rehabilition center after she is well enough to get there. Thank you for taking the time to read this and every little bit will help.Sarah

DENHAM SPRINGS, LA                                




Just a few weeks ago, our dear friend to the Alex Band fan family, Nikki King, was devastated by the massflooding in Louisiana when 22 inches of rain fell within 24 hours, completely destroying the contents of her home and the homes of her family.  Nobody expected this and nobody was prepared for what was about to happen. Nikki's family was rescued by the Coast Guard helicopters and boats andbrought to a shelter where they slept on the sidewalk until the water went down.They eventually made it home only to continue to have to sleep outside as their house was uninhabitable. They have madedue with one vehicle for 11 of them, an RV and daily trips to retrieve water, ice and hot food hoping there is enough available for the whole family. Luckily, family helps get you through but Nikki is overwhelmed with the prospect of rebuilding her life as well as help her immediately family rebuild theirs.They are constantly reminded of what they have lost, as everything they once owned isnow out inthe front lawn, broken and ruined.Due to an insurance loophole that doesn't cover home contents relating specifically to flood, they will not be reimbursed for anythingin their house.

                        We are the Louisiana Federation of Republican Women. I am the Treasurer of the state federation in Louisiana. Many of our federated women are experiencing the devastation of the recent flooding in South Louisiana. LFRW has been asked by many across our nation, ""How can we help?"" We are establishing this appeal, and a committee to screen all requests, in order to help those with the most urgent need. Applications of our affected members will be reviewed and funds will be disbursedaccordingly. Words cannot describe the devastation which has occurred in South Louisiana. Imagine all that you have built over a lifetime....pictures, gifts from friends, souvenirs from treasured moments, in the blink of an eye.totally gone.   Before any rebuilding can take place, all must be thrown out, mudded out and then most of what is left must be torn out, dried out and disinfected before rebuilding can start. A safe place to live until you can move in, clothes to wear, a place to wash clothes, take a bath, a tooth brush to brush your teeth.......all are needed. Imagine totally starting over. Many of our members are facing these challenges. Federal assistance is slow and cumbersome to obtain, if at all, but the necessities of life are immediate and sometimes painful. Their needs are the basics---clothing, toiletries, and medicines, cleaning supplies. We are a resilient people and this tragedy has brought out the best in the people of this area. Neighbors have helped without regard to race, creed or national origin. This is truly America at its best. Help us to help those who need help now.LFRW is not a 501c3 organization.

CABOT, AR                                





                        Hello Everyone,                             My name is Ashley Bowmaster, and I am the wife of Jason Bowmaster who is now medically retired from Jacksonville Fire Department after 14 years of service. On March 19, 2012 around 10:45PM, my husband and his Captain responded to a single vehicle accident that hit a gas main on Hwy 161 at the 8400 block. The woman of that vehicle was fine, but the gas main still needed to be shut off. Unfortunately, Engine 4 did not have the proper fitting to shut the gas main off. My husband, his Captain, and a police officer were standing off to the side of the road in a drive way with their reflective vests on waiting for the gas company to come and shut off the gas main, meanwhile the woman that was in the accident called her son Bryce Allen to come and pick her up. Bryce Allen showed up in a tan mini van, and without haulting, accelerated and hit my husband, his captain, and a police officer. Captain Donald Jones was killed instantly. My husband and the police officer was severly injured. My husband sustained the following injuries...his femur was broken in 3 places, he had 5 broke ribs, a partial collapsed lung which ended in a fully collapsed lung, his pelvis was broken in half, his clavicle was broke, he bruised his spleen, he had lacerations to his face and hands, he sustained blunt head force trauma, which has effected his speech and left him with frontal lobe damage and brain diffusion. His bicept tenden was shredded as well as his ACL. My husband has gone through several surgeries and workers comp has paid for these, but when a firefighter medically retires he only gets 65% of his pay, that alone was a devastating blow to our income consisdering I was in school full time and had to take a year off to take care of my husband, after a year I went back to subbing for the Cabot School District and was a full time student at Harding University taking night classes to try and hurry to finish my degree. I am currently still taking classes online and will finish at the end of this summer. Over the past year now we have been fighting with workers comp because they have made things very hard for us and in January of this year we had a hearing to attend for a judge to decide whether my husband was permanently disabiled, and up until this time we have not recieved any help what so ever from the state of Arkansas. The claim commission will only award $10,000 if you are injured in the line of duty, We have reached out to the Public Safety Officers Benefit Program in Washington but have not heard anything and that was submitted in July of 2014. The only statis update I get is that it is still in the legal department. We have exhausted all resources financially, so far we have been on this journey for over 3 years now and it has not gotten any easier. I am here to not only ask for your help but to alsoraise awarenessthat police and fire are not taken care of financially when they are injured in the line of duty and are forced to medically retire because they can no longer do their job. When you have a family member that is killed in the line of duty they are taken care of very well by several different resources, which they should be. The judge rendered her decision on April 30th, she gave the following percentages 61% for wages lost, and 70% as a disability rating...Sounds great so far doesn't it, here is the bad news...Workers Comp put in that they wanted to place an ""OFFSET"" on the ratings, which means this...with both ratings that equals out to be $175,000, the ""OFFSET"" from workers comp takes away from that total. As of 5/18/15 I spoke with our attorney and he informed me that workers comp will not be offsetting from both percentages...that's good news...here comes the bad news, while talking with the work comp attorney, he informed our attorney that he would be appealing the ratings to the workers comp commission, which means we would end up with less. As it stands right now without the appeal, we would get $60,000 and that is a huge amount and a blessing, but think about it this way, my husband still had 15 more years to retire, and was going to stay with the fire department well past that. Worker comp is currently paying on his first MMI rating but that will end next month and once that happens we will have to live off of his Retirement which is only $1900/mo. First Responders serve their communities in all different capacities and deserve better than this. I hope to one day change this but like everything else, it is going to take time.<iframe media_type=""0"" media_id=""SwItE1thWa8"" class=""youtube-replace"" title=""YouTube video player"" style=""margin-bottom:20px;width:560px;height:315px;"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/SwItE1thWa8/?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""1""></iframe>

                                                            on behalf of Ash Brittenham

MONTPELIER, VT                                




Hey -- I'm Ash Brittenham and I'm a 19 year old guy living with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I've been driving a power wheelchair (a cool one) to get around since I was eight. I just moved to North Carolina last year from Vermont for the better wheelchair driving weather (read: NO SNOW). But I've had a lot of trouble finding accessible affordable housing. Many apartment buildings listed as accessible simply aren't, even though we all know about the Fair Housing Act and the ADA. We've been renting a tiny place that just doesn't work.


Also I'm a student - doing audio production online through Full Sail University thanks to Voc Rehab help, so my money is really tight. And, dread, I'm still living with my mom cuz I just cant find a place to live that I can get into and take a shower. I've looked everywhere. I am on wait lists and local agencies are out of ideas. Medicaid is useless.


Anyhow, my mom's boyfriend just bought a house for us, but they sunk all their cash into just getting it, and I 'm needing to get a ramp on it.



I'm fundraising to buy a steel ramp which I will take with me to my next place - hopefully my own apartment in Charlotte. Its gotta be real long cuz as you can see in the photos the doors are pretty high. But once inside, I am golden.



There are so many barriers to independence for a person like me. This year has been a real eye-opener. I'm really pretty angry about how impossible the world makes things for us. This summer I marched with 800 disability rights activists through the streets of Washington DC. The chants are pretty obnoxious, but the message is clear. OUR HOMES NOT NURSING HOMES.


I am not giving up! But I do need a little help right now. Thank you for thinking about it. I really appreciate any help I can get.

HOUSTON, TX                                





                        Back during the April floods in Houston, Kevin and Jessica Jensen's house experienced a catastrophic failure of the roof and walls which allowed water to seep into the house. Water and mold damage required the insurance company to have the house inspected. The insurance contractor demolished the inside to the point it is not livable and now the insurance company is refusing to fund reconstruction.The insurance company has put Kevin, Jess and the three kids into a temporary apartment until November. Kevin and Jess have had to file suit against the insurance company and will soon be homeless.The house still just sits. Not only have they had this to deal with, but Jess has had two surgeries in less than a year and they have now also had to incur legal fees at no fault of their own for something totally unrelated. Now is when they need our help!Kevin and Jess are working with a few veterans groups get some help in the meantime. In order to get their house livable without help from the insurance company, they need services and materials donated. The first item is to get the driveway back up and in running order so deliveries can be made to the house. If you know anyone who can donate concrete wash out, crushed concrete and equipment, it would be most appreciated. After that, building materials such a as drywall materials, insulation, flooring and paint will be needed.If you don't have the resources, then cash will help them pay for what they cannot get donated. Your help is greatly appreciated. Prayers are also more than welcomed during this time. This precious family is hard working and just trying to make the best of tough times. Oh and did I mention that Kevin is a Purple Heart veteran and a full-time student at Texas A&M on the GI bill? As an employee in the Cy-Fair school district, Jess serves the families of the CFISD and Kevin has served for our freedoms. They are giving and serving people so let's serve them know to show our appreciation.Here is the order of operations...1. Get driveway repaired so trucks can get up it and get dumpster out there2. Get electrician out-many things not working3. Get plumbing checked 4. Get water well checked -it's running funny - may be do to electrical- we had a crazy power thing out there with the lightning 5. Get some sort of temporary housing set up- American legion I believe is doing this for us - single wide trailer7. Get pods out of storage and move some stuff to trailer and then put the rest back into a cheaper storage unit6. Roof7. Tear down rock and put up new siding and brick if that's cheaper 8. New Windows 9. Demo inside 10. Interior11. Get horse stalls back up - roofs flew off part of them in tornado that came through

                        My name is Iman Kanaan. I'm trying to raise funds for the old man in the photo attached.This 84 year old man told me he was abandoned by his own son. He's been living on the streets of Beirut for the past three months. He spends his days on the pavement as shown in this photo and his nights at a close by mosque.People give him food and drink but this is not enough.I'm trying to fund enough money to secure him at least a two year stay in a Senior's Home ( Dar el 3ajaze). Should something happen to him before then, the money can be allocated to another senior in need.My heart is breaking. This man is so sweet. He's fully concious and can have complete conversations. I think that his life would've been much easier if he did have a problem with his memory. At least then he'd forget the son he raised all these years only to have him thrown on the streets like this.Please help me help him as soon as possible.Thank you in advance.Ive been asked by gofundme to provide additional information. I'm Lebanese- Canadian. This man is called Abdallah and he's not related to me. I just saw him on the street in Beirut. Your donation money will be used towards paying the monthly fees for the seniors home which we will be contacting on Monday since their office is closed till then (because of EID Fitr).The donated money will not be given to him in hand. It will be paid directly to the seniors home and I will be personally responsible for delivering the money.Thank you again

                        Hi all! About 10 months ago I created a GoFund mefor Cameron Oates to help his homeless family out.If you recall, his family was suddenly evicted from their apartment last year by a racist landlord who discriminated against Cameron and his family. Thanks toyour incredible generosity, we were able to meet our goal which was used to cover the attorney fees to file acase against their former landlord, which is still underway.

As we all know, finding a place to rent with a past eviction is very difficult. It doesn't matter that the eviction was completely unfair, until justice is served and the case is closedhis family has remainedstuck living in a homeless shelter.After a year of one heart breaking event after another, Cameron finally got some good news today! One of Cameron's many good friends in the community, Officer O'Rourke ofthe Roseville Police Department,called to let himknow they had found a landlord that understood his situationand would let Cameron and his family move in right away! Hence why we're here; he needs help coming up with the deposit and first months rent.For those of you who don't have the absolute honor and privilegeto know Cameron, here is a little bit about him.Cameron was born withbrain damage, yet is by far the hardest working, most grateful, and kindest person I have ever met.I have never once, in the 10 years that we have been best friends, heard him complain about anything. He has worked at Pride Industries for several years, a non-profit which helps people with disabilities find employment.Additionally, he has successfully completed many classes at Sierra College. He remainsactively involved,announces games for many of their sports team, and is the first person to lend a helping hand or words of encouragement to anyone in need.Ifthere is any list I can make that's close to as long as the reasons Cameron is so wonderful, it's unfortunatelythe list of hardships he has endured and overcome in his life.There is no one who deserves awarm place to sleep and a roof over their heads like Cameron and his family.This world is truly blessed to have hisindescribable spirit, and the least we can do is help him in his time of need the same way we know he would do give anything he could to help all of us.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Your support is so very appreciated and I will keepyou posted with frequent updates.

SALEM, OR                                





                        Maria Laine (my step daughter) had a devestating house fire Saturday night September 17th in Salem, Oregon. She and her daughter, Madi, 12, were in bed and she smelled smoke and they ran out the door as the garage was consumed with fire. Luckily Max, 17, was not at home the night of the fire. The fire spread quickly through the attic and ceilings and the house is a total loss. The picture is of their kitchen, dining and family room area. Maria and her two kids, Max and Madi, do have insurance but there are VERY REAL short term expenses as almost none of their possessions are salvageable. Maria is an extremely hard worker, and a dedicated mom. She needs to work at her new job, the kids need to go to school, and she needs funds to carry on a life as normal as possible amidst this disaster. She has had ENOUGH diffiiculty in her life and I hope you will pray for the family and help this gofundme drive so she can have some funds for living during the months it will take to sort everything out and get insurance reimbursment.Thank you!

                        Unfortunately I am starting a gofundme for my children who just lost a big part of their life, their dad. He was unexpectedly taken from them shortly after dropping off our youngest son on sunday. Unfortunately our daughter, our only daughter discovered her father in this untimely event. I'm reaching out to anyone who is willing to help. I know its not going to bring closure but I am hoping that this helps to ease this massive loss for our children. He wasnt't just a great dad, he was also a great cherished friend. The money will be divided between our 3 children to help as their father always helped them as he did in life. Whatever you can give will help. Even a dollar means alot. I can't express in words how much this will mean to our children, not just me.

                        Thank you for taking the time to look at our gofundme page. We are Mitch and Juanita Surman the parents of Diego Surman. Diego is a young man of 19 years of age. Diego use to be able able to use his arms and legs but multiple surgeries for brain and spine tumors have resulted in him now being a quadriplegic.The money you contribute will be used to purchase a track stander chair. These chairs are currently being used by our brave men and women in the military who have suffered major injuries that have resulted in loss of mobility.This chair will make it possible for Diego to spend more time outdoors and will allow him to be in a standing position. Diego has not been able to stand since 2012;this chair would help relieve some of the discomfort of always being in a sitting position. Diego is looking forward to being able to go deer hunting with his father this November 2016. We have been so blessed with support since Diego had his first surgery when he was 5 years old. We have always be so thankful and continue to be grateful for any financial help and prays. God bless you.

I have been married to Ian for 40 years, we have 3 grown children and 13 beautiful grandchildren. We live close to our 2 daughters and their families. Ian and I have had a dream for many years now to sell our large 5 bedroom house to our yougest daughter and her husband and 5 children, who are ready to buy now. This is the house we raised our family in, and it would mean a lot to see it stay in family.The other half of the dream is to use the money from the sale of the house to build an inlaw suit onto our other daughter's house. Evenafter selling the house we will still be left with a deficit before we can build our inlaw suite , and that is what we are asking for help with.We have always believed in homes with genrations of the family living together, creating a mutually beneficial situation. We have also lived in town our whole lives. Both Ian and I are very much ourdoor people. We love gardens, birds, water. Our daughter's home is in the country with a beautiful view of a lake. There are always birds to watch! It has been our dream to retire in the country.We are so close to being able to do this plan. We have been waiting for years till we were financially ready. But now, we have time running out. Of course Iwould love to get a chance to see this whole plan done, but even just getting to see it started would leave me with with peace and comfort knowing Ian would be living with family when I'm gone, not on his own.  We have already started putting this plan into action, so we could use help now.We would be forever grateful to anyone willing to help seethis dream come true in the time we have left together!

                                                            on behalf of Courtney Feider

BOISE, ID                                





                        Most of us look forward to each Friday. That feeling of pulling into the driveway, walking in the door and dropping the keys. Setting aside the weeks stresses to hug kids, share a meal and unwind. On a warm Friday afternoon in August, Courtney Feider looked forward to all of those things as she pulled into the driveway of her home after a busy week.Instead, she found herself in a life-or-death battle.Courtney was brutally assaulted in her driveway by a meth-addicted, desperate man who had just pointed a gun at two bond officers who knocked at his door to confront him about a skipped court date. This man was on the run. When he spotted Courtney getting out of her vehicle, he saw her as his way out. The next few minutes were like a horrific TV crime show scene. Courtneys attacker beat her over the head repeatedly with the handle of his gun. She took several blows, but didnt lose consciousness. He became even more desperate. He threw her to the ground to strike a harder blow. He ripped her top and underclothes. He beat her face. He split her scalp.Courtney never passed out from her injuriesduring these few brutal minutes. Something told her to stay alert and memorize as much detail about her attacker as possible.This man won a temporary victory, gaining access to her keys and speeding away with her car and everything in it, leaving Courtney stunned and bloodied in her driveway. But his escape was short-lived. Courtneys clear description allowed police to quickly identify the suspect and distribute his mugshot to local media. Days later, detectives tracked this man to a home in Caldwell and after a brief standoff, took him into custody without major incident.Courtney suffered serious physical injuries after the attack  severe swelling to her forehead, bruising under her eyes, and multiple staples to repair the deep laceration on her scalp. Those injuries are slowly healing, and she is now faced with the most difficult and agonizing part of her ordeal: the treatments and therapy to help her mind and body heal after this assault, the loss of personal and family property, and the ensuing court case against her attacker.This family needs our help.They are faced with extraordinary expenses that they never, in their most horrific nightmares, could have ever anticipated. To make things worse, they are trying to cope with the harsh reality that any financial restitution for the crime is not likely.The key financial blows are as follows: *Courtneys Dodge Durango is beingreleased from anpolice impound lot three weeks after the assault, and is obviously not in the same condition it was before it was stolen. Understandably, it is not a vehicle the family wants to keep. Hopefully they cantrade it in, but it will probably not retain the same value it had before the crime, leaving them with a large car payment they hadn't been planning for.*The Feiders have a large amount ofinsurance claimsto file, and arenot likely to receive appropriate compensation.*Courtney is self employed. Up to 55% of her day is now consumed with dealing with the repercussions of the assault, which has significantly impacted her ability to work.Additionally, a significant amount of personal and business property was either stolen or severely damaged during the attack, including her laptop, phone, camping equipment and a large batch of Courtneys Fig & Honey product line for Whole Foods, putting the total damages in the thousands of dollars.Friends, many of you know that the Feiders are the kind of people who are first at your doorstep to offer their hearts and hands during tough times. Now, this family needs us to do the same for them.Please help in whatever way you can, whether financial or otherwise. If you wish to make a contribution of time, talent or support, please contact the organizerof this campaign. There are so many ways to help, and each way is valued and deeply appreciated.Finally, we ask that you keep this family in your thoughts, hearts and prayers as they navigate a very difficult situation with as much strength and positivity as they can muster. The weeks and months ahead will be a slow process of recovery and  we hope  redemption.With love and gratitude, Feider family friends

                        At approximately 7:30pm on Saturday, 9/17/16, a plane caught fire mid air and crashed into my neighbor's house in Gilbert, AZ. It is a miracle that the pilot, skydivers, my neighbor's and my family are all safe and uninjured; however my neighbor, Peter Lebeau and his wife lost their entire home and all of their belongings. While we waited on the street last night watching the fire fighters try to control the fire and damage he said to me, ""this is all I have!!!"" as he looked at his t-shirt and sweat pants. Peter's home is a complete lose and all of his personal items are gone. Whilemy home has severe smoke and water damage, it is nothing compared to my dear neighbor's circumstances, We still have very few details currently; but we know that we are blessed to be alive and un-injured.I started this fundraising page to help withmy neighbor's circumstances. Peter and Sharon will have to pick up their lives from this disaster. I've chosen an arbitrary amount as the goal because it is required in order to create a fundraising page, but any amount at all is hugely appreciated.Please keep my neighbor's, Peter and Sharon in your prayers, for physical and emotional healing, and joinus in thanking God for protecting our lives in this tragic event. I will update as I can.Thank you,Kevin and Catharina Wilhelmsen

EAU CLAIRE, WI                                




Around 10:00pm on Wednesday night, September 21st, a flash flood hit Eau Claire. The rain came down at an alarming rate, and the little creek next to our small home in the valley rose an alarming25 feet. The culverts put in by the county to handle the water weren't big enough for its volume and the rage of the storm, causing the culverts to plug up with downed trees and some of our possessions. Like a clogged bathtub drain, the plugged culverts created a lake instead of the usual few inches of water that trickled down the creek on any other day. It continued to rise, climbing and climbing, until our home filled with almostthree feet of water. The worst part is that we were not at home when it first hit,but our dogs were.Earlier, Dave had heard the thunder and the ferocity of the storm, and a little voice inside him said he should head home. He reminded me that Lilly didn't care for loud noises, and we agreed he should head out. When he arrived at the top ofour slopeddriveway, he realized it was under water. Dave called for the sheriff to come out,but was told they were too busy with other storm-relatedemergencies to send someone. Luckily, our amazing neighbor, Tom, and his son, Isaiah, came over to help.The land around our house slopes slightly from back to front, so the deeper water near the front deck blockedtheir access. Therefore, the three of them walked on the slippery hillside through blackberry tangles around to the back of the house, where the slopehad a shallowerapproach.Wading in chilly, waist deep waterto the back door,Dave tried to open it, but the tipped over refrigerator was blocking the door. The only way into the home was going to be by entering through a second story sliding patio door. With a helpful boost up by Tom, Dave was able to enter our upstairs bedroom.Tucker, our Brittany,was in his kennel andwaiting patiently for our return when suddenly the house filled with rapidly rising water. He was inches away from being totally submerged when he was miraculously able to break out of his metal cage to free himself. Walking down the staircase, Dave saw Tucker standing on top of the couch, one end bobbing in the dirty water. When he called tohim, Tucker swam over to the stairs and Dave was able to pull him up to safety. He handed him out the 2nd story window downtoTom .Little Lilly, our black & silver Mini Schnauzer, wasn't so visible. Dave listened intently and followed her softwhimpers. Wading over to her, he found hertrying to kick her way up onto one of the dining room chairs to keep her little head above the water. He grabbed her and carried her up the stairs and out the 2nd story patio door to safety. Strange as it was, the electricity was still on. The sockets were under water, but the lights were on. By the time Dave was able to grab a fewthings out of the upstairs and get to the end of the driveway, the house went dark. The breakers hadfinally tripped, plunging the house into darkness. The vehicle headlights were the only illumination of the surreal scene.We thank God for protecting our furry little children, and Dave and our neighbors from getting electrocuted as they saved them. We lost our 3rd puppy, Cheka (Tucker's great-grandfather), a few months ago. At 13 years old, he would not have survived the ordeal. We are grateful that he went Home before this.By the nextmorningwe arrived at the home to survey the damage. Thankfully, the water had receded, but it left a residue of mud and silt on and in everything it had touched.In the garage, the two chest freezers used to hold the bounty from our organic garden and staples for the upcoming winter were turned over, and the food had defrosted. Because of the bears in the woods surrounding our home, the food hadto bequickly disposed of elsewhere. The boat and trailer had been lifted up to the garage rafters before settling like toys in the lowered water. Many things in the garage floated around the yard. Some probably floated down the creek, and others were caught in the blockage at the culverts.Dave and I were marriedtwo and a halfyears ago. We realized his little dream cabin on four acres in the woods wasn't big enough for our family oftwo humans andthree dogs, so we had looked at remodeling this little piece of heaven. We were told that we wouldn't be able to do so because the house was located inside a 100 year flood plain. Dave had never been required to get flood insurance though, as his house had been ""grandfathered in"" when he bought it 26 years ago. He has never had a problem with water in the home, even though there had been several times when others in the area were flooded. It just didn't make sense to buy flood insurance when high water hadn't previously approached the level of the house.We now find ourselves living with friends, and our fur babies are separated because we can't have them both where we're staying. The house is a total loss due to the water damage. Anything electronic is ruined. The cedar walls are destroyed. The floors buckled, all the wood and upholstered furniture warped beyond repair. The drainfield appears to be collapsing, and both the septic system and water well are affected with water levels such as this. If we wanted to rebuild the house, we couldn't because the county would not issue a permit for us to do so. The value of the land has dropped through the floor, since no one purchasing the land will be able to build or remodel either. How can you help? For now, we need to find a temporary place of our own to live where we can have our puppies with us. But we need to find a long-term home too. We are not spring chickens anymore, as we're both in our 50s. We were hoping to kick our retirement plans into gear in just a few years, but this floodhaswashed those dreams away. We hadplanned to use the proceeds from the sale of my husband's little piece of heaven in the woods to help with a down payment on a slightly bigger slice of heaven somewhere else that could hold all of us. That's gone. If we waived a magic wand and the county gave us permits to rebuild, we'd need money to do so, plus furnish the home.The chances the county will do that are slim, especially if they see that the hillside on which the house sits is crumbling away because of the flood.Even if we tried to bring the house back to how it looked before the flood, the typical household furnishings, electronics, kitchen appliances, washer, dryer, furnace, and water heater all need to be replaced too. The money would help us buy a new home and furnish it, now that everything has been destroyed. If we get to rebuild this one, the money would pay for all the cleanup, including the septic and water systems that were flooded.Financially, we are not rich. Far from it. My husband lived simply and frugally his whole life. I was a single mom who raised two sons andam paying off five figures of medical bills from a cancer diagnosis a year ago. Thankfully they were able to get all the cancer, but not without ahefty price tag. We were in the process of finally having everything we both had wanted our whole lives - to live happily ever after, holding hands with the one we love, while sitting on our front porchas we sharedstories about the good old days, dogs at our feet.Can you help us get that dream back?Do you know someone else who might be able to help us?

All of those happy, healthy moments of play that we so easily enjoy are beyond the reach of children living at the Quang Binh Orphanage in Vietnam.We are an adoptive family who has been blessed to adopt our son, Eli Quang Pham, from the Quang Binh province in Vietnam. As such, we are morally and spiritually bound to the well-being of Eli's first homeland, and his first home, the Quang Binh Orphanage.When our family returned to Quang Binh in the summer of 2015 to show Eli where he had been lovingly cared for in the first 11 months of his life, we foundthat the Quang Binh Orphanage still lacks adquate toys and books for the children and elderly who reside there. Also missing is one of the true and lasting joys of childhood-a playground.All of the money raised through this GoFundMe campaign will be used for supplies and installation of a permanent playground for the use of all children and elderly residing at the Quang Binh Orphanage in Quang Binh, Vietnam.Our goal is to raise $10,000 for the necessary supplies and installation of a permanent playground on the grounds of the Quang Binh Orphanage. We hope to be able to collect these funds over the next 8 months, to ensure total funding by the end of 2016.Our family is so grateful for all of the love and care that Eli received at the Quang Binh Orphanage the first year of his life. We want to repay the Quang Binh Orphanage in a loving and lasting way-a way that will positively impact the emotionaland physical well-being of all of the children and elderly at the Quang Binh Orphanage for years to come. That is why we have dedicated ourselves to raising the money for and overseeing the building of a high-quality playground.We thank you with all of our hearts for helping to care for the children and elderly of the Quang Binh Orphanage through your donation. Most of all, the children and elderly will be thankful, and they will be playing-thanks to you!

"Save Remi from homelessness,"$3,707","$6,000",Emergencies," September 20, 2016",39,5,PORTLAND,OR,188000,,1,"






                            Remi Tippetts
                            
                            
                                                           
PORTLAND, OR                                





                        I have been having a long term health crisis and have been too sick to work for months. At first I paid for expenses out of my savings, but now I'm almost out of money. I have suffered from suicidal depression, panic attacks, extreme fatigue, difficulty breathing, hallucinations, and hearing terrifying voices. Sometimes I pass out for 24 hours at a time and can barely move when I wake up. Doing even simple daily household tasks has become challenging for me. At first my doctor thought my ailments were mental, but as the duration and severity of my symptoms grew we both began suspecting an underlying physical problem. We recently discovered that my thyroid gland is dying and I have a mass on my throat. My doctor is currently running tests to find out why. Hypothyroidism alone can cause numerous problems including extreme fatigue but I suspect something more than that is wrong with me. The level of illness I have is unusual even for a hypothyroid patient. I have high levels of ferritin and c reactive proteins which would indicate the prescence of an additional long term disease. Trying to find out exactly what's causing this has been a slow process of elimination that is still ongoing. I HATE asking for money but the reality is that I'm completely tapped out and I'm being evicted. I took out a hardship withdrawal from my 401K but that's gone now. I'm applying for disability now that I finally have a substantial diagnosis but I need some way to pay for rent at a new place while my disability application is pending. I know that the ammount I'm asking for is high but my symptoms have only been growing worse over the months even as I've tried over a dozen medications. I don't foresee a return to work any time soon. Gofundme will let me keep whatever is donated even if I don't reach my goal. Disability applications can take months to process and most people are denied on their first application and have to appeal even if they have a legitimate claim. I 'm tired and weak most of the time and need a bed I can use at any point in the day. For these reasons I am going for a moon shot. I will be very thankful to anyone who can give. Every little bit helps.Lastly I will note that I unfortunately can not accept offers for free housing from people outside the Portland, OR area. The silver lining of being so poor this year is that I qualified for medicaid, which is paying for all my expensive appointments, medications, and tests, but my network coverage only applies to the Portland metro area and would not transfer elsewhere if I moved.

                        This morning my dad's home burnt to the ground. Thankfully he was able to get out along with my little brother and their three dogs. This was his home for as long as I can remember (about 20 years?). He lost everything he's worked for, they got out with just the clothes on their backs, even his car was lost. He has been a hard worker his entire life making many sacrifices for his children. Now that we are all grown up and he was able to think about retirement, he finds himself starting from the bottom again. I feel very helpless and figured setting this up could possibly be helpful.

"Fire2home need repairs help please,"$1,541","$4,500",Emergencies," April 25, 2016",26,5,DETROIT,MI,507000,,9,"






                            Jan Davis
                            
                            
                                                           
DETROIT, MI                                




My house caught fire from some demon torching the vacant abandon house next door to me and it spread to my house. I was crying so while trying to make the 911 call because I saw the smoke, flames bellowing out the windows of the abandon house and shooting over towards my kitchen windows. I knew it was just a matter of time before my house would catch on fire and it did. I was screaming and pleading with the 911 operator to please hurry hurry get help here. I knew if they could get here quickly that maybe can save my home from burning down.We are truly bless it did not burn all up and that I was awoke and able to get us out the house in time. I am very distraught because I don't have home insurance and it looks like I got thousands and thousands dollars of damage done.

There is myself and my daugther and my one and only grandbaby he is 2 and I take care of him we all live together. I'm disabled for many years after a hit/run accident and I can't work. I'mon a small $650 disability income and I just don't have the money to get my home back right. If I could pack up and leave Detroit I would I'm fearful of living over here but my reailty is I don't have the money to just pack up and go. So tired of people picking on us, we bother no one over here, just wanted to make the community better, clean and free of crimes and drugs, some don't like that so we are targeted. The person that did this the local crackhead don't like it that try to keep people out this house from doing negative stuff so I guess he decided to burn it down and my house too, from what I see he don't like me because I want better for my neighborhood and he don't.


Myhouse is smoky and water damage and tore up upstairs and in my kitchen. Carpets wet, leaky ceilings from all the water they shot in the house...I had stuff I had stored upstairs tore all up or melted that got to be thrown out. It just so surreal like its a dream or something just can't believe this happening. I set up this Gofundme page reaching out in hope that people can give us a helping hand and make a donation, please. I need to have my house repaired for we can have a safe/clean house to live in again. I owned my home but had to choose between either paying uitilities and on my property taxes...or get home insurance...I just could not afford to do it all.


All I know I'm hurting deeply we don't bother no one or keep up any trouble in this neighborhood. Its so sad I just wanted somewhere nice to live and be proud of and not embrarrass of my neighborhood, ok and most of all to be able to live in peace, that's all... is that asking for too much? But, it seems we can't get that peace living here in the city of Detroit. Sadly, we can't feel safe and secure in ourown home. My God, you would think your home wouldbe the one place you can be safe secure and at peace but its not, its hard living here. I know stuff happens all over but here is the worst! Everyday you hear of this or that crime going on always some negative. Wedon't bother anyone, I just wanted better for us and the neighborhood I live in, that's all.


Please if you can help with whatever you can give it is much needed and appreciated.If you are not able to donate please will you consider sharing myGofundme page please. I appreciate all you do. Thank you for your time. God bless us all.

                        I'm 62 and normally a resilient and generally upbeat guy. But now and then one of those ""dark night of the soul"" periods close in. Like now.The cause is -- and I hate admitting it -- a recurring financial shortfall that began with the 2008 Great Recession and, for me at least, has yet to end. In late 2008 the Oregon company I worked for steadily for 7 years started letting people go, and I was one. Firing was used, although later proven illegal. But when I got canned I also lost my first-ever home, on which I had a normal 30-year fixed mortgage and had paid down a fat $80K in cash to get, along with another $70K paid-in over 5 successive years. That was all lost in 2011 when foreclosure could no longer be forestalled nor negated by any means. I packed up what I could and moved back to Northern California. I aimed to rebuild my life. But as many of you out there know, the Great Recession is barely over for too many folks.Some know that I resigned last June from my last job here on the North Coast due to some very unpleasant situations involving my departmental supervisor; I won't go into details since it would be very inappropriate. But I also tried to ""wing it"" for the last two+ months, ""pulling myself up by my own bootstraps"" and gradually going nowhere that way. Job applications and resumshave been distributed but no jobs have been forthcoming. I aim to work again, at least until I can realistically retire at 66 1/2. Right now is what matters.So I'm facing a very difficult, hyper-stressful time, short far too much in cash -- I have no reserves anymore and haven't been able to earn enough to save. Thus threatened now by lien are my stored household possessions, small personal library and keepsakes. This is my most urgent need. Current storage lien and back rent is now $700 and counting. The September rent payment is already due at $230 and October looms.Do I let it go and live the lighter life? That feels like sheer madness, if only because I have a few pieces of real ""grown-up"" furniture and probably several thousands of dollars worth of hardbound reference and history books plus the few familial keepsakes that would be forever lost if auctioned-off at the end of September by the storage company.I must also soon pay my benevolent and gracious landlords some real rent; painting their new home last month only went so far. My unemployment insurance should kick in pretty soon, but that will only get me back into the rent-paying role. There will be nothing available to hand get my possessions freed from the storage facility's lien or keep those payments current thereafter -- or move a reduced number of things into smaller, less expensive quarters. How do I currently live -- in what setting? Tiny. Compact. Basic. I have a several years' old 240 sq. ft. studio apartment with bath and micro-kitchen that runs me $900/month. Yes, even rentals in Fort Bragg and its immediate rural surroundings is high compared to some places. But I have reason to stay put. I was honored recently by being asked to serve on a local historical society's board, and that organization's archives is helping me finish a major history book manuscript on a local, long-gone lumber company. That book has been my life's ""work"" as a sideline to professional work. I love living here where there is peace, fresh air and a lot of good people who feel the same way.I could use your immediate help. I would truly be from-the-bottom-of-my-heart grateful to any who can assist, with the hope that I can pay it forward when someone else asks. https://www.facebook.com/kevin.bunker.984

Our mother, Rosie, is living with alzheimers and sadly last week she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer.

The holidays have always been very special to her, nothing makes her happier than having all of her family in her home enjoying eachothers company, eating, laughing and sharing memories.

This Thanksgiving we'd like to get her remaining living children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and other family all together under one roof, her roof, for what could possibly be her last.

We are also going to take advantage of having everyone together for one last family photo. We are going to super impose my siblings, 2 brothers and 1 sister, whom have passed, into the photo making it a cherished and deserved gift for our mother.

Those of you experienced or familiar with alzheimers know it can be a very lonely place. We are hoping the photo can bring her comfort and remind her of what an amazing and dedicated mother, grandmother and wife she is. That she raised a remarkable family and to swell with pride of her life's dedication to loving us and creating a positive foundation which has led us to grow beautifully and lead the lives she always wished for us.

We are hoping to raise enough funds to help with travel costs for those out of state and for the family photo to be done professionally.

Thanksgiving is just around the corner. If you could donate even the smallest amount it could help us reach our goal. If you could please share our campaign on your Facebook page and with your contacts it would help is so much.

Thank you for taking the time to read about our amazing mother. We want to make what time she has left as wonderful as possible. We are so grateful we have time to say goodbye to her. We want to make the sunset of her life as memorable as possible before alzheimers takes it away.

Thank you so much. ..



For my mom

The blunt force of the impact caused his vehicle to roll several times before landing on its wheels.He was rushed to the hospital where he underwent multiple surgeries to date and he remains in critical condition. Most injuries were on the left side of his body including fractures to his left hand and leg. The most severe damage was done to his left ankle and he will soon be undergoing many additional surgeries to repair it. He also has bruising to his left lung and his heart but no severe damage to any other major organs. There will be necessary surgical repairs done to repair some abdominal trauma. He also has a fracture to his left orbital socket with slight bleeding behind it.He has responded to a few commands but is still currently sedated withhopes of waking at some point within the next few days!!! We are blessed and thankful to report there is no head trauma or damage despite the extensive injuries! Thank you everyone for the prayers and wishes!

On July 15, 2016, a massive fire broke out in their garage that quickly engulfed their home, destroying it and causing them to lose everything but the clothes they were wearing. Thankfully the family was not home at the time of the fire and no one was injured. Unfortunately the cost to rebuild after such a devastating event is very substantial.

When someone is in need we support those individuals in anyway that we can. We hope that you can donate but if you can't, you can help by sharing this page with your friends and family so others can help support the Ebright's as they rebuild their life one day at a time!

                        We are raising money to help pay our lawyer. We are trying to become guardians of our niece and nephew, who have recently been orphaned. Also, we live out of state and have to fly in for court. The cost of this has been huge and we need help. My husband and I are a military family with one income. Neal has served in the navy for almost ten years. He has gone on four combat tours. Neal is in a enlisted to officer program for nursing. I am a stay at home mom, we have two kids and are hoping that soon we will be a family of six. Thank you, anything helps.

                        I am hopeful that the kindness strangers will help a person find his path again. This is a young man who admits to making mistakes when he was younger, mistakes that caused him to be in the position he is in now. In reality, he is hoping to rehabilitate his life freely. Those that truly know Melvin, will state that he is the hardest-working, generous, warm and self-less man. He puts others before him and is such an intellectual human being. The advice he gives to people, the fact that he can turn any sad situation into a happy one, and stay positive through it all amazes me! Melvin's situation is not going well which is why raising money for a private lawyer is important! He is willing to fight as long as he can and has convinced me that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Having faith in God and knowing that he will always be on the right side is what this has come down too. I am urging everyone who has ever made a change for the better or looking to make a change in their life to help me and give him a fighting chance to do the same. I would be thankful, he would be thankful, his family would be thankful, knowing that people are coming together as one for a good cause. Please don't let this go unnoticed and help save a young mans life by contributing anything one can which will all go towards the lawyer fees. Thank you.

My original scan showing lung mmetastasisUpdate::: They have diagnosed me as Terminal. Please help my last months be comfortable::: *PLEASE READ ALL THE NEW UPDATES. THE CANCER HAS METASTASIZED MUCH MORE THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, (as you can see on the paper I received today where it says goals for treatment) the treatments I am receiving now are for palliative purposes to help prolong my life and for comfort, as some of my tumors are much to large to operate on, not to cure my cancer, as at this stage it is incurable) AND MUCH MORE TREATMENT AND BILLS ARE INCURRING. PLEASE HELP* Below is my current chemotherapy treatment planHi. My name is Lisa and I am 36 years old. I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer at age 32, metastatic To bones (spine and right hip in 2013 which has grown worse and is actually causing scoliosis in my spine, and now, as of November2015, metastatic to my lungs(8 places) and at least 12 lymph nodes in my lungs and abdomen. I do carry the breast cancer gene 1, which is why my cancer is so aggressive. I am on my own as of right now, as my husband is unavailable to help me at the moment. I have applied for ssi/ssd, and have a hearing scheduled, and have 0 income . I have already been on adriymycin/cytotoxan, tamoxifen, arimidex, all to,the fight the cancer, those treatments failed, and It is still spreading. According to my new oncologist, these tumors should have been caught years ago(based on size and location), but instead I just kept on being diagnosed with chronic pnemonia, emphysema, sarcoidosis, chronic pain, (more than once I was told I was ""faking it"", causing me to lose all hope in everything, just wanting it all to go away, end the pain and SOB)ect, until I sought a second opinion and had a PET scan and biopsies in November 2015. I was told by my oncologist if I had not come to him when I did, I would have been dead in less than6 months. I am o2 dependent, requiring to be on 3 lpm 24 hours a day, require a wheelchair for most distances, I cannot lift or carry anything, I have constant spasms in my arms and legs, and have many other medical issues that make life very hard. (dysphasia, painfull swallowing, (requiring a special diet) gastroparesis, severe osteoporosis, gi bleeds, heart issues, sarcoidosis, hypoxia, chronic nausea and vomiting, severe GERD, bradycardia, mild heart attack on September leading to 12 days in the ICU, ect) I am trying to raise money to help me get necessities such as my medication not covered by insurance, (about $400 a month),my car back to home(it broke down in Pittsburgh and sits at a hospital social workers house), my phone on to keep in touch with doctors and my husband, help with my kids, my special diet, and desperately need help for rent and utilities, daily living expenses, as I am homeless and have no family in which to help me. My family left me living my car with nothing, knowing how sick I was, in fact I'd have to meet my oxygen company in a walmart parking lot every 3 days so I didn't run out. I have a wonderful friend and surrogate family helping me out as much as she can, but I feel guilty having to depend on her. I have had 30 surgeries and 56 hospitalizations since 2012. I am unable to work, I am unable to drive anymore, require nursing care, and my current chemotherapy(taxotere, cytoxan, neulasta every 3 weeks times 6 rounds( for palliative purposes only to try and prolong my life) and medical regime is kicking my ass, landing me on breathing tubes , lung taps, and everything, and would not ask if it wasn't important.(I have learned my lesson there, as money seems to be more important to people than anything,, even to the most religious people I know), but I am in a desperate situation. I have exhausted all avenues I can think of, even asking places such as The American Cancer Society and the Susan B Komen Breast Cancer places for help, and was flat out denied, even when we were living in our car. Please donate if you Can, even a dollar helps. If you cannot donate, please please share so my plea can be heard. Thank you. Please ask if you have any questions!!Below is a picture of me and my niece at the first hospital before my transfer to the cancer hospital.

In the middle of the night, someone intentionally set fire to my brother's car for no reason at all...The same person that did this, set fire to another vehicle down the street.As a husband and father of 3, this was his means of transportation to and from work to provide for his family.He took very good care and was very proud of his car. His family has gone through some hardships and now this has really set them back.They only had liability on the vehicle, so this is a complete loss.

All the money raised will go to help them purchase a new vehicle.It would mean the world to me and to them if you could find it in your heart to help this family in need.If you can't afford to donate, please help by sharing this to othersThank you for all your love and support! God bless!

SAINT LOUIS, MO                                





                        We are a Contemporary Issues class from Lindbergh High School that has been following Sa'ad's story and his struggle to get restettled into the United States. We learned about Sa'ad's story through the Men in the Arena film updates, which the class has been following for 2 years. Its a human rights story, and a rare sports journey principally shot and produced in Kenya, Somalia, and the United States. Earlier this year, we met with Saadiq, Sa'ad's best friend, to hear about their story of hope.  Men in the Arena Trailer Sa'ad was born in a rural village in Somalia just a few months before the Battle of Mogadishu.  Hegrew up in Afgoye, a rural farming village 18 miles northwest of the nations capital. He never received an education and, despite living in an agricultural center, experienced intermittent famine throughout his childhood. In 2010, a representative from the Somali national football (soccer) team discovered him in a village game. He joined the squad that year, but soon after, the Al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group Al-Shabaab, which has held varying degrees of power in Somalia since 2006, captured him. The group held him for seven days, threatening death. Eventually, they whipped him publicly 38 times and released him a month before Somalias World Cup qualifying games.   Due to Sa'ad's popularity back home and willingness to share his story in the film concerns grew about him becoming a target if he stayed in the region. After a year of hiding in neighboring Kenya as a temporary refugee (he was arrested eight times by corrupt Kenyan police looking for bribe money) he was fast tracked for resettlement to the U.S. Now he is here and he needs help. He needs to pay back his plane ticket and loan for his arrival funds. He also needs help with basic necessities and transportation. City buses can get him to his English class and a first job, but getting to training sessions throughout the city without a car is almost impossible.  Sa'ad desperately wants a chance to play pro soccer and we want to help get him that chance. J.R. Biersmith, the director of Men in the Arena, who connected us to Sa'ad, will be in charge of allocating the funds to Sa'ad through a WePay account. At the end of the school year, we hope to present the funds to Sa'ad during the school day. We hope to help Sa'ad accomplish his dream of living in the United States and playing soccer!Read more about Sa'ad's journey in the Sports Illustrated article below.Salvation in soccer: Dream-seeking Somali refugees reunited in U.S. Above: Saadiq and Sa'ad reunited at Lambert International Airport.

CASTLE ROCK, CO                                




Hello!My name is Hope Walter, and before I get into detail, I would just like to brush over the purpose of this gofundme fundraiser.I absolutely love special effects makeup and videography, I have for many many years. Throughout the time I've had with these passions, I have struggled financially trying to purchase the neccessary products and items to achieve greatness. I do not know when I will be able to afford the things I need, as I do not have a source of income. With bills, issues and daily needs, it has also been very difficult for my family to raise funds to support. I would highly appreciate any support anyone may be able to give, as this is so very important and meaningful to me and several others. I love each of my followers so dearly for their encouragement and compliments on my work; I hate to let down anyone with the known information that I do not have the correct products to continue on. My goal is to become a trained sfx makeup artist featured in local short films/videos/movies, this is actually better called a dream of mine. I also enjoy the field of videography, filming and editing beautiful videos for clients. All I obtain to do this is a camera, tripod, and editing software that is soon to expire. I would love to have a microphone, proper lighting, grips etc., and eventually a better camera to improve my work. Seeing the smile on a client's face after they receive their video is what keeps me going - I cannot miss out on any chance I have to bring joy to another. This project is being held to help me create a portfolio for college, as I will be headed in that direction very soon.I hope to expand in my talents to be able to explore all sides of sfx makeup, creating more than just blood and gore. I have wanted to test the waters in so many other things like body painting, custom mask-making andcreatingflat molds (appliable prosthetics) that I have not been able to do.There is also a very special and personal video I have been planning to create, something I have never before done, covering some very important things I will soon announce to the public. I do not have the proper equipment to make this video as special as the topic it covers.If you choose to support me on this project allowing me to be able to get the things I need, thank you so so much and I highly appreciate this great act of kindness you have shown.Every cent that is donated will be wisely spent on supplies needed to progress in my passions of sfx makeup, videographyand joy for helping others. Items/products purchased with the donated money will be shared within a special 'thank you' video I will make.Those who donate will receive a series of rewards, listed near this description. Each reward is very personal from me to you in thanks for supporting this campaign. Some of the rewards however, require shipment of the gift to your home. If you do not live in the U.S., pleasecontact meto plan accordingly to the situation.It would be absolutely brilliant for at least $500 to be raised before Halloween 2016, so that I will be able to express this art on the holiday; not only for me but for my family as well! I would love to do some effects on my little sister, parents, and myself.Now that I have briefly explained the main reasons why I am doing this campaign, I will now explain my story in more depth.I am 18 years old, was born in Virginia and currently reside in Colorado. I am an aspiring SFX makeup artist/videographer.(me)I immensely enjoy the art of anatomy and learning special effects makeup, creating sculptures and prosthetics on skin. My main goal in sfx is to make wounds/any kind of makeup look super realistic. I plan on getting bone and anatomy replicas to help me study and build these things to my best ability.(A cut wound effect I did on my arm)I have dabbled into this field for a little over a year now, and still own all of the 'beginner' products regarding sfx. However, many of the essential products I once had have run out. There are also several products that I have dreamed of having that I just simply cannot afford.(Skelton face-paint. This was not fun to take off.)I have experimented in all sorts of makeup from prosthetics to paint.I have definitelyenjoyed my experiance with face-painting and wish to continue on, hopefully doing some body painting work.As some of you may know, professional sfx products are quite pricey, my dreamfake blood brand being nearly $60 for a small portion. This has made it so incredibly difficult to be able to do successsful and realistic effects.It is very upsetting knowing that I am nearly out of all of my products when Halloween is just around the corner...(The Joker; D.C. character cosplay - eyes in this photo are photoshopped)Any support for allowing me to get these sfx products is extremely appreciated and I cannot thank you enough.Videography is something I've been crazy for since I was ten years old. I always wanted a video camera, and when I got one for my 12th birthday, I went crazy with it making silly videos and still do to this day.I have my own videography business entitled Hi Hopes Studio which provides services to anyone who wishes to capture the most important things in life, memories.(this is a still from the 'Paige & John Winfree' wedding video I did)My first videography service was to film a wedding video for my newly engaged sister. This was such an incredible opportunity and I was honored to do this for such a lovely soul. All I had to do this was a camera and an editing software. I would love to be able to get bettertools and other essentials to improve the skill I have for this passion.You can view some favorite wedding videos I have done for clients (first link is my sister's wedding aka my first videography service):Paige & John Winfree: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jD94pkdCzsCarina & Kevin Metso: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR4N5DOJ3_IServices to others may be my favorite part, but I also significantly enjoy filming behave of my own creations.I would love to film my own shorts some day.I would love to get the needed things to create very well performed video tutorials - I have a few sfx tutorials up that have very bad lighting.It was difficult for me to create this campaign to raise money as I hate feeling needy and burdened. I spoke with several near and dear people in my life to make the decision, and had someone tell me that sometimes we must humble ourselves to ask for help when we truly need it.I thank you so very much for reading through all of this if you did. Thank you so much for supporting if that is a decision you made.This fundraiser means so much to me in knowing it brings me closer to achieving my hard-to-reach dreams. The things I am raising for are so significantto my heart and have impacted my life in the greatest ways imaginable; I cannot wait to progress in my talents and be able to make more people smile.Again, every cent that is raised will be spent wisely on sfx makeup products and videography supplies.I cannot argue enough at how thankful I am to those who choose help out with this campaign, thank you so so so much and bless your heart.-Hope

                                                It pains me to have to go this route but I'm setting aside my shame and guilt and just asking for financial help. I'mXenia Galaviz and Ihave to fly to Guam to see my Papa in his last days. He was recently diagnosed with leukemia and at 88 years old, there aren't any treatment plans or options. I am his first grandchild and he is my hero. This man with his 2nd grade education is trilingual and raised a family of six. He always educated me on culture, politics and boxing. A diehard Democrat, when he was recently released from the hospital he went to vote. He's that type of man. He has always been accepting of everyone and never judged. They broke the mold when they made my Papa and it tears my heart that someone still so alert and active at his age only has six months to live. Please help me get to Guam. Your donations will help me purchase a flight (LAX to Guam is not cheap) I am so grateful for anything you can donate. He will be surrounded by those he loves, family is so very important to all of us and I want to see him while he's still alive.Reasons I'm asking for money and don't have a nest egg:I have been employed since I was 14 - I worked in a video store and eventually was a video store manager in high school. I started at Honda Center in Anaheim as a cashier and eventually walked the floor as a supervisor. I was there for 18 years as a Union member when they decided to go non-Union and was laid off in 2013. I was there during a couple NHL lockouts which depleted our nest egg. I started freelancing as a blogger and investing in my side business as well as my husband's side business. This year hasn't been the best financially for us and we suffered a significant loss of income when I left Mode Media (coincidentally a month before they closed their doors)I promise you I will pay this forward, it is my way of life.

NISSWA, MN                                




Upon returning from a family vacation in Sept 2016, Ryan and Mary Clair were greeted with this: ""Just got home from vacation! It felt great to breathe fresh air for five days!!! Here's our mold story: We discovered some mold before our trip and got it all cut out. My allergies have been awful for several months with a non stop sore throat, etc. So this wasn't really surprising. We paid to get an air quality test done & got the results while in South Dakota. Turns out we have the most toxic form of mold and super high levels of it. This means we have undiscovered mold somewhere else and were told we need to gut our entire basement. So we came home early today to pack up the basement so we can start tearing things out on Monday but the house is way too bad for us to go in right now. "" (post from Mary's Facebook Sept 2nd, 2016) This was Ryan's Post:""When you can smell the mold from inside your car pulling into your driveway it might be a bad sign... Welcome home Clair Family, welcome home... ""Since this time the Clair's have been forced to move out of their home with their four children and have found out that home owners insurance willnot cover any of the cost to remove the mold or repair it. The Clair's are an amazing family and have been trying to deal with this situation on their own. Ryan has been working tireously to uncover and remove the mold. Throught the help of friends and church members they have made some progress, but it is estimated that it will cost over $30,000 to complete the job, replace lost items and make repairs. Please consider giving a donation to help the Clair's return home.

I am making it a goal to raise sponsorship money for the Miss New Jersey 2017 pageant. These funds will go towards trip and hotel expenses, my stage presentation, wardrobe and other important gifts and prizes. As one of my sponsors, you will play an integral part in helping me accomplish part of my goal. Your name, or business, will be submitted in the pageant program book as important recognition. This opportunity means the world to me, and if I win I would love to go on to Miss USA. I would speak on the topic of assisting veterans, cerebral palsy, or bringing more technology programs to urban communities.

                        Thank you all for reading this.My wife and I own and run a small business called Gone Broke Gaming. We carry everyting from Atari to Virtual Reality. On September 8th our store was broken into and robbed. The front door glass was kicked in, the biggest showcase glass was also kicked in. They ran of with my cash register and 2 Xbox 360s. The camera's and motion sensors both malfunctioned. Safe Touch Security claims no responsibility. So we have to replace a lot of tempered glass, register, receipt printer, 2 months of quarterly taxes, the till, change security company, get new security cameras, and bars for the windows and doors for the building. Had this been worse it could have forced us to close our doors for good. I'm thankful it was not as bad as it could have been but we still need some recovery help.We don't just want your money though, we need cash now and will pay it forward to you in the way we can, let me explain:Anyone who donates over $20 (must include your name on here) can have $20 in store credit on a buy one get one free offer. We have never offered BOGO before nd it will be limited to only people who donate. This will also extend to a (1) game from the showcases, also has never been a part of any deals.It would be great to get this goal hit within two weeks. We thank you all for your support in this time of need. We are attempting to expand our store as well, so everyone can have a better shopping experiance and this really set us back, recovering some of these funds with help keep the expansion on track. Again your help is very much appreciated

I am a person with morals and a work ethic.


I am here fundraising on GoFundMe because the alternatives are to let a corrupt agency Slander and Libel me without a fight as retaliation for whistleblowing on Civil Violations and Criminal Acts.


I can show that I followed policy in what I now know was a corrupt agency that does not respect the rule of law.


Due to the many illegal actions on the part of this agency,
I have been forced to sue them....All avenues of resolution have been exhausted,I am on the verge of losing everything because despite my IQ , I am simply too stupid to give up and give in and let the other side win.
I would rather gamble on embarrassing myself here on line requesting help than become another statistic
revealing how there really is no whistleblower protection and all attempts at Logos and Ethos have failed and only Pathos or the dread of it remains.


I seek your helpthrough re-posting and or contributingto continue to fight the good fight
because my motion to be provided with a Civil Lawyer
due to pauperis status was denied.


I welcome legal assistance from people who actually still believe in the legal system or in lieu of that, people who are burned out on the corruption who will help me fight
corruption and win...


Ifyou can't render aid you can re-post and re-tweet this campaign. If you can't do that you can tell your friends there is someone risking everything for a principle. If you can't do that then put anyone you know who can read between these lines in touch with me,because I am not giving up the fight.

"Accessible Home features for Eamon,$846,"$25,000",Wishes," September 14, 2016",14,10,GROVE CITY,OH,126000,,2,"






                            Jenn Casey Castaldi
                            
                            
                                                           
GROVE CITY, OH                                





                                                Our 9 year old son, Eamon, was born with Spina Bifida, the number one birth defect in the US. It will never go away, and he will face several challenges, societal and medical,his entire life. He can not use his legs and has no control or feeling in his body below his chest. He still manages to play baseball, kayak, and ski. He wants to play wheelchair basketball too. Most of all... GO BUCKS! He's a HUGE Buckeye fan, so you know how our family spends their Saturdays.The real struggle at home outside the medical challenges are that our home is a two story home (we didn't know about Eamon's challenges when we bought the house). He can't get up the stairs himself and because his chair doesn't travel well on carpet, he's essentially trapped in his bed until we come to help him get out and downstairs into his chair. Our current home is holding back his independence.Eamon's dad and I have been working with a home builder to alter a floor plan of one of their single story homes to give Eamon as much independence as possible and for as long as possible (he's still a growing boy). Things like zero threshold doorways (no steps into the house, just ramps or landscaping to bring the outside level with the house), wider doorways (to fit his wheelchair through), sinks he can roll under to wash his hands, a roll in shower, drawers and cabinets in the kitchen that give him as much access to the contents as possible, and laminate floors throughout the houseare all things that mean so much toward his independence after seeing him not have it for so long.But we need help. The cost of creating a home that allows Eamon to feel at home is more than just building with a cookie cutter. He needs to struggle to do things himself and actuallysucceed. The house has to be set up to do that. The alterations we need with the builder will allow Eamon to wake up, transfer to his wheelchair, head to the kitchen and get his own breakfast. It will allow him to go to other rooms on his own when he needs some quiet time. It will also allow him to have friends over and access all areas of the house freely.The plan with the builder has to be finalized in two weeks and we will need to have the money for the changes in by January 10, 2017 so we have the funding at closing.Eamon's dad and I work hard to work around the obstacles life put in front of us, Eamon, and his sister. This obstacle is proving more difficult than any other. Being able to make these alterations with the builder will mean we will be able to create a single place in Eamon's life where he won't have to question his independence.We can't say how much this would mean to Eamon and us as a family because of what this would do for his independence. We are so greatful you took the time just to read our story. Please consider giving and sharing our story.

                        This is Bryce, it is his Senior year of High school... his final and most expensive year. After this year Bryce hopes to join the Police academy.This account will allow him to participate in school activities that he otherwise would not be able to afford to do. These include all dances like homecoming, prom, grad night, games, and even get a yearbook and his senior pictures. Bryce works after school every day with his single mom trying to help better their situation. She doesn't want him to have to miss out on the last bit of his childhood due to financial restraints. We strongly believe in paying it forward, so any monies not used for Bryce will go to another struggling single parent for their child's senior year.

Freedmen's Town Preservation Coalition needs your help. Freedmen's Town represents living history that is evidence of African American accomplishments, prosperity, culture, faith, and society within a larger society. The Freedmen founded and settled Freedmen's Town, a swampy terrain along the Buffalo Bayou that ""no white man could have worked or lived and endured the insect bites and malaria, snake bites, impure water and other hardships."" However, the Freedmen survived and thrived in-spite of the obstacles. Today, only 30 structures and 7/10s of a mile brick streets remain. However, it still represents the the ancestors' spirit and hope for the future of the race. Since July, we have been going before City Council asking the Mayor to Rethink Houston and how to save the last vestige of Historic 4th Ward to no avail.""On January 20, the judge granted us a Temporary Restraining Order. On January 28, a different judge ordered mediation. On February 4, mediation was held with no resolution.""We are now asking your help for legal funds as the case continues. The money is needed immediately and we are requesting any amount you may chose to give in our effort to save the legacy of the work and spirit of the Freedmen. They left a gift for us to pay forward to future generations.Won't you help?Thank you for your consistency and not being silent about History that Matters.

"Bria Taylor for Miss Maryland USA ,$485,"$4,000",Wishes," August 5, 2016",10,1,SILVER SPRING,MD,155000,,1,"

SILVER SPRING, MD                                




Greetings Everyone! Thank you for visiting my GoFundMe! For those who may or may not know, I have been chosen as an Official State Finalist in the 2017 Miss Maryland USA pageant. This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am very excited for this new journey. There are many reasons why I have both chosen to compete for this title and create this fundraiser in order to assist my journey in becoming Miss Maryland 2017.About the Miss Maryland USA Pageant The pageant will be held from November 4th-6th, 2016 in Bethesda, Maryland. The pageant consists of 4 categories: interview, swimwear, evening gown, and final Q&A. The winner of Miss Maryland will go on to compete for the title of Miss USA and Miss Universe. Why am I competing?PlatformFor some, there is a certain connotation associated with pageantry.However, this title goes beyond wearing beautiful gowns, photo opportunities and public appearances. As ayoung woman who is confident in all of her God-given gifts and abilities, I seek the title of Miss Maryland as a platform to combine my talents in order to promote real change. As I have adjusted to my new home over the last two years, I have noticed a serious issue of homelessness within the area. 85% of homeless children perform below reading grade level. Without a stable environment, these children are less likely to development a love of reading that often leads to educational success. In partnership with my communications firm, I have already begun the preliminary stages of my reading program, BookBuddy, created to help homeless children develop a love of reading. With the title of Miss Maryland, I would use this platform to expand BookBuddy through avenues that typically would not be available. ScholarshipMost recently, I have graduated with honors from Howard University, obtaining a Bachelors of Arts in Public Relations with a minor in Spanish. Currently, I am gaining industry experience in brand marketing at one of the top global communications firms, FleishmanHillard. However, my love of learning has not ceased; I strongly desire to continue my professional studies. The winner of Miss Maryland USA will receive over $40,000 in scholarship funds. Wining this title would be a major blessing toward my pursuit of a graduate degree. Beyond these motives, I believe the pageant will be a fun and exciting way for me to gain a new experience while networking with young women and businesses throughout Maryland. Why $4,000?In order to compete, each young woman is responsible for paying a $195 registration fee and raising $995 in sponsorships for the pageant. This sponsorship fee goes toward the production of the pageant weekend, scholarship prizes for the top 5 finalists, and funding for the woman crowned Miss Maryland 2017. The remaining funds will go toward my pageant expenses such as: pageant and fitness coaches, professional photographer, pageant apparel (gown, swimwear, opening number dress and interview suit), professional hair/makeup artists, and the various other miscellaneous items needed to compete. SponsorsFriends, families and businesses can all contribute as sponsors. Each sponsors name will be printed in the official pageant book. Individual sponsors will receive an official receipt.Business sponsors will receive ad space in the official pageant program book. Additionally, business sponsors will receive a business receipt and will be able to use this donation as an advertising expense and tax deductible. Sponsors can contribute directly via my GoFundMe, the official Miss Maryland website, or by submitting a check/money order. No donation or sponsorship amount is too small. Any amount is greatly appreciated!For more information on the pageant, please visit:  http://www.missmarylandusa.com/maryland.html To donate via the sponsorship portal, please visit:  http://www.missmarylandusa.com/maryland_payment.htmlFor more information on sponsorship or my program, BookBuddy, please email me at bria.sym.taylor@gmail.com.  I thank you for your time and your contribution toward my dream of becoming Miss Maryland 2017!

MILWAUKEE, WI                                





                        Our friend, coach, writer and all-around great guy Joe DiGiovanni, along with his family, is facing a very tough challenge ahead. Joe's recent, difficult cancer diagnosis has turned his world upside down. He has been handling it with grace, dignity and fighting spirit. Joe is determined to not let this challenge define him or slow him down. If you know Joe, he will live life to its fullest. We would like to help him do just that by sending him and his beloved family on a dream vacation. Whether you know Joe through softball, church, work or the neighborhood, you know there are two things he loves the most: his family and sports. Whether its his leadership of fastpitch softball or at church or on the job, we are all thankful for his gifts of time, talents, enthusiasm and patience over the years.We hope to be able to raise enough to fund this vacation (location and timeto be determined). When friends are facing tough challenges, it's hard to know what to say or what to do to make a difference. Let's help his family create more memories to cherish forever.

                        I'm Kim and I'm an 8 year EMT. A co-worker of mine, Ron and his family need our help for his young son, Nathan.Nathan Patterson is an 11 year old boy diagnosed with Lissencephaly since birth. Lissencephaly literally means ""smooth brain."" It is a rare brain malformation characterized by the absence of normal convolutions (folds) in the cerebral cortex. Nathan's case results with cerebral palsy, leaving him wheelchair-bound. He experiences recurrent daily seizures and significant respiratory disease. Our beloved Nathan requires constant care.As Nathan grew and his mobility needs changed, finding housing or renting an apartment that would meet his needs proved a constant challenge.With some help from family, Nathan's parents, Ron and Julie, have been able to build a handicapped accessible in-law residence for Nathan.We are planning a fundraising event. Our goal in creating ""A Nite of Comedy for Charity"" is to raise awareness, and money. In their continuous efforts to provide their son with a new, safe, and accessible home, Ron and Julie have been faced with an ever increasing financial burden. Nathan deserves a home where he can grow and continue to surprise the family that loves and cares for him so much.With his degree of diagnosis, Nathan was not expected to live more than a couple of years He is now 11 years old. This boy he is a fighter! He must get it from his parents who have both worked this year beyond exhaustion to make this home a possibility.For those of you who know or work with Ron, it is obvious that Nathan is his life and his world. Our brother in EMS, and his family, could use a little relief. Let's gather to help out our family with some community, laughter, good cheer, and generosity.Come attend ""A Nite of Comedy"" for Nathan.February 13th, 2016 at the Polish American Club in Cambridge, MA.7pm-11pmFacebook link: A Night of comedy for Nathan

"""" Achievement and Pride ! ""","$1,513","$5,600",Wishes," July 25, 2016",34,2,ELMWOOD,NE,242000,,1,"






                            Kabrianna Kay Mumford
                            
                            
                                                           
ELMWOOD, NE                                




Dear Generous, Friends, Family and Compassionate Strangers, 


 My name is Kabrianna Mumford. Cheerleading , is something I do, - its Not - Who I Am. 


I am a junior at Elmwood-Murdock Junior/Senior High School. I participate in many school functions and clubs such as Band, Spanish Club, Speech, Quiz Bowl, I am above a 3.5 GPA, Perfect Attendance since Kindergarten, Multiple 1st Place award winner in school science fairs, Member of F.B.L.A, E.C.N.C. , I Participate in Competition Speech, Have recd Superior Rating in Band, ( I Play the French horn ), Chorus, ( Both Band and Chorus - as a Group and Individually recognized ), and was nominated for Best Supporting Youth Actress As Gretl in local production of the Sound of Music at 8 yrs. Old. And have participated in dozens of others both on stage and in school. I am Planning on attending College and Majoring in Psychology so I may help children and troubled teens . 


I pride myself on my social skills, my friends see me as a confidant, and someone they genuinely are fond of and enjoy spending time with. Ive made Honor Roll every semester since Being eligible, Recognized every year by the State of Nebraska as a High ability learner which has Recommended me for - and assisted in placing me in Advanced classes since 7th grade, will begin College courses in junior year in Psychology. Top of my class in achievement in math and science. Oh,...and a student asst. Coach in track.....as well as a Blue Belt in Karate. 


But what this is about, - is in fact - Cheerleading. Which I am currently Partially responsible for Choreographing Dance routines,and have recd multiple Team and individual Awards for. Including, for the first time in the History of Elmwood - Our team Won the STATE Championship for Class C-2 Non Tumbling ! 


 I have been a cheerleader since my freshman year of high school, in Elmwood , Nebraska. A relatively small Village of approx. 650. This activity takes a great deal of time and dedication. It Encourages, - at times even forces you, to make decisions ,and prioritise everyday life unexpectedly. Promoting Focus and Responsibility. 


It pushes you to physical limits and if you are not prepared to put your all into it ,you arent going to be very successful. I have given up certain events and activities to be able to participate in this sport (yes, sport) and I dont regret a moment. It has made me more mature, well rounded, and received benefits I have yet to fully understand and appreciate. 


 I have been given opportunities to meet people from different states at the cheer camps we travel to ( Did you know there is a girl from Arkansas - ( Actually Mrs. Arkansas ), with MY first name - as Her middle name?  ...Sorry , more a personal side note ,- but interesting considering the rarity of my name.Anyway ). This year our camp experience was very successful. We earned three gold ribbons, one blue ribbon, Top Banana, 1st place in sideline, 2nd place in Xtreme routine, a Superior trophy, the Leadership Plaque, two St. Judes Pins, Three Pin-it-Forward awards, Three All-Americans and I earned the Dancing Diva award. 


 Pin It Forward program promotes all of the values encouraged through cheerleading; leadership, spirit, commitment, kindness and motivation. We cant forget all of the great benefits of cheerleading and the positive ways it affects our lives such as gaining confidence, becoming physically fit and healthy, being involved at school and in the community ,showing our Pride in both - while hopefully instilling and promoting that Pride into others. Not to mention becoming all-around better athletes. A total of six of these awards were given out at camp this year, and I was fortunate enough to be a recipient of one of them. 


 All-American Cheerleaders are girls and boys who were able to: (Females) - Perform the Xtreme Routine Dance, (Males) - Perform a stunt instead of the Xtreme Routine Dance, All-American Cheer, and your best jump. All of this is expected to be at a highly superior level. We were grouped in numbers between 3 and 4, but were judged as individuals rather than together. It is considered one of the most Elite groups of Cheerleaders. Three members of our squad, including myself, were honored to be selected this year. 


Through this program, we are now given the opportunity of a lifetime. We are able to travel to LONDON, to participate in the London New Year's Day Parade, to represent our country and our individual states and schools/community. This is a week long journey where they, our guides, take us around and outside of London to learn about and experience the culture and history. We are set to visit famous landmarks, such as Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, and witness some spectacular events that Im certain will be unforgettable. One of the days we are set to be over there just so happens to be my 17th birthday; ( Jan 2nd ) , and I cant imagine a better way to celebrate than to be traveling overseas to the place of AMAZING accents , beautiful scenery and architecture! ( And lets not forget, -  The Birthplace of Dr. Who ! and Benedict Cumberbatch ! ) 


There are not many times in a life that you are given such an opportunity. The only places Ive ever been are states that border Nebraska. So this is HUGE for me. Its been a dream of mine since I was little to be able to travel anywhere, especially to another country, and this is hopefully the beginning of many more!  


What I am requesting , from all of you, that have taken time from their own lives, to show even a few seconds of concern for my plea, ( Which I assure you with all the sincerity i can offer, and from morales and ethics instilled by my parents ) , is a request for monetary assistance and help that is simply put - desperately needed, and is Only being asked for because of my family's and my own inability to raise the money any other way. I am attempting to do what i can through concessions, craft sales, a makeshift lottery, etc But I am afraid I will fall short in the small time frame I've been alloted. 


The "" Trip"" is over Christmas and New Years day,.....The Amount Needed has to be raised and given to organization "" By November 4th !!


The majority of you I will never meet, and Never be able to properly thank. But I Promise you, I Am humbled , and appreciate your generosity if even a fraction of what is needed is gained by this page. So I say now,...THANK YOU ! Thank you for reading, for your compassion, Thank you for your generosity. If I go,...Look for the girl in the Black White and Silver in the picture on this page - New Year's Day in London. I got there - Because of Your Generosity and Belief in Me ! So not only will I be representing my School, Community, and the United States of America,...I - in a small but Heartfelt way, will also be Representing Each of You !  


My family and I on our own cannot possibly even imagine to afford such expenses. With the help of my community, extended family, generous strangers and friends, I hope that this dream of mine can become a reality. All monies raised will go towards the amount on this page, which has been predetermined by  VARSITY SPIRIT CORP., (They are who organizes and sponsors these events) . It is my understanding this will completely cover all necessary expenses. 


Again, My Sincerest and Heartfelt Thank You , Even if you only just read. My dad taught me,... Expect Nothing , Earn and Deserve what you get , - Including Respect , and Never take for Granted - what youre Given . I Promise you, I Never Will ! 


  Sincerely, 
Kabrianna Mumford 


( Almost forgot,...  GO KNIGHTS !  )

The phone call was the horrible news that their house caught on firewhen they were at church.God definitely protected them.Sadly, their fur babies (Becca, Romeo, Juliet) didn't make it and have gone to heaven. You can see the beautiful and sweet Becca was so happy in Alicia and John's wedding picture below. It's so heart breaking and I can't imagine what I would do if I'm in Alicia and John's shoes and I can't imagine anyone else to be in their situation. They lost everything to the fire: from their fur babies to everything that was inside the house. I live so far away from home (AL) and I know many of us as well, so this is what I can do to help Alicia and John to get back on their feet.Please join me to help them! Thank you for visiting this page and helping!!Everyonethoughts and prayers are with you Alicia and John. We pray that you have comfort during this hard time.We love you,

                        On Sunday, August 21 Ben was hurt badly while working on clearing trees on his property. The doctors expect he will be unable to work for 6-8months. This is going to provide a lot of challenges for the family because Ben is self-employed and without the ability to be on his feet he cannot work. For those that know Ben, this is going to be a tough time for him as he is constantly on the move working to provide for the family.The Schlotte family would be grateful for any help you can provide during this difficult time. With Ben out of work, finances will be tight around their beloved ""Four Squared Home"" with five amazing kids to take care of and what surely will be some steep medical bills. The Schlotte family is one of the most giving and loving families we have ever met. Any amount that you can give would be greatly appreciated.

                                                            on behalf of Cindy Ward Schrick

SAINT PAUL, MN                                






Our close friend Cindy needs your help to bring Marcel, her 13-yr-old son, home.


Cindy Ward Schrick is an amazing mom, who declared divorce from a German national in Germany. With her ex-husband's agreement, she returned with their two sons to her hometown in the United States in 2013 to start fresh and make St. Paul, Minnesota their home.


Her sons' health and well-being was and is always her priority, and together they created a warm, loving and safe home and community surrounded by family and friends in St. Paul. In the summer of 2015, her then 12-yr-old son, Marcel, went to visit his father in Germany. Marcels father refuses to return Marcel to Cindy, and communications with Marcel have largely been cut off.


Cindy and Marcels 12-yr-old brother, Andre, love Marcel dearly and want to bring him home to them, his adopted cat Scout, maternal grandparents and broad community of family and friends whodeeply miss him.


Thats where you come in.


Cindy filed a petition with the U.S. Department of State to return Marcel under the International Treaty called the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, to which Germany is a signatory.


Cindy needs help raising funds for high costs that she is faced with when pursuing an International Hague Petition in Germany to have Marcel returned home to her and Andre.


Please contribute whatever you feel able to and spread the word to anyone who may be interested in helping Cindy have her son returned to her.


To be able to enter a Hague Case in Germany, there is a minimum cost of EURO 1500 (1673 US Dollars) for a German Central Authority appointed lawyer. This is for legal representation and without knowing from the GCA if this amount will even be sufficient and of the lawyer's specific experience in Hague cases. Estimated costs to obtain a lawyer of her choosing who is both fluent in English and also highly experienced in Hague Treaty cases would be between EUR 5000 - 10000 (5,577 - 11,154 US Dollars). This does not include extras such as travel if possible, lost time at work, further translations and specialized therapeutic costs. Hague Abduction cases cost on average upwards of EURO 26894 (30,000 US Dollars).


Due to the legal circumstances, we cant share more about the situation, but if anyone would like more details, they can contact Cindy directly via private message to Bringmarcelhome@gmail.com

This is a great chance for you to help a mother and brother who feel helpless obtain the means to have the person they love most in the world returned home to them. They miss Marcel very dearly and are terribly worried about him.


Please keep both Marcel and his brother in your prayers and positive thoughts.


Thank you in advance for helping Cindy bring Marcel home!


Sincerely, 
Wendy Huckaby and Pepita Bos


Here are a few details required by Go Fund Me to share:


Who we are: Wendy Huckaby and Pepita Bos, Cindys friends


Where you're from: St. Paul, MN, and Comares, Spain (respectively)


Your relationship to the person you're raising funds for: Friend


How the funds will be spent: To retain legal representation in Germany to litigate Hague Petition in the German court, travel to Germany to appear in court if possible, and communicate with legal representatives/consultants to have Marcel returned to St. Paul, MN, USA.


How you intend to get the funds to those in need: Electronic Transfer to Cindy Wards Bank Account, which will all be verifiable

                        Hello, my name is Christina Figueroa. I was in a car accident two weeks ago that wasn't my fault. I got t-boned on the right side while on the back of a scooter. I'm trying to raise money because I've had to stop working. I fractured my right leg in two places and now have a metal rod in my leg. I have a bunch of numbness and stitches I'm still recovering from. My left leg has ruptured knee ligaments that will need surgery as soon as the right leg recovers fully. I was tossed pretty hard on the concrete so my body is in pretty bad shape. I'm asking for all the help I can receive. I have a 6 year old son that is with his father right now, thank goodness. But I am afraid I will be out on the streets soon. I have a boyfriend but we just started dating and he's not capable of paying the bills. He is working hard to help me but I'm super on edge. Please help me with this amount so I'm capable of just paying my 800 dollar rent, 130 phone bill and extra just for some food. I've put this amount for at four months. I'm trying to be completely honest with everything so if you have questions or need proof, I'll be happy to oblige. Thank you for reading this.

My /(your's too) insurances are going to not pay and claim Subrogation.It means there is no recovery. The at fault party is fully protected as well. The little video is but a short piece, the hand is graphic but just shows I fall get cut and don't have insurance. I have contacted our representatives enough to be annoying. They called SSDI onmy behalf6 times so far. Still 2 years until I see a judge to decide clearly what is right.We have an emergency meeting via phone with DCF for me to be re-enrolled into the medically needy program. That's a month away. aWe were going to move back to NSB Fl,and SHANDS CHARITY CARE decided I should at least be seen. The results were not shocking to me or my family. My neck is broken in two places, the hardware is bent and sticking out. The last MRI Caught the implant in a complete different spot, further backing my feeling it move around. These surgeries were going to happen right now, except yesterdaymy landlord broke our lease toown contract and had us evicted.We have 5 days!MY SON graduated2016 and has been my means of work.I was told the ervical surgery is 8 hours.It hurts. I will be in the ICU for 2 weeks,then regular room 2 weeks and finally sent home with a nurse. The nurse will be here 6 months and then PTand straight to the Lumbar surgery. I will only be hospital 3 days then,but down for a full year. I didn't know what to put on right for how much but it is aboutwhat I need now due to the unforseen eviction.

                        Sadly, our very special friends, Bird (Van) & Pat Parker lost ALL their personal belongings, clothes, furnishings etc... by the moving company (in a fire supposedly) when they moved back to Virginia this month to be near family. The company turned out to be a scam, preying on elderly people therefore insurance may not be able to help them buy anything...... let alone the personal things never to be recovered. Of course to go after company would take years, lots of money & not likely to happen and wouldn't help them now.Bird's exceptional personality has given so much love, support & positive vibes to me and so many friends, ""little birds"", ""pretty birds"" etc.. and loved ones over the years, despite losing his leg & health issues.......I know he would never ask for help, but I know many people who would want to help anyway. Thank you for your support!

                        In 2011 I had a massive heart attack requiring two stents. This put me out of work and pretty much for any future hope of a sustantial job opportunity. My father later had a coronary incident which has brought me home to care for him and my mother both at 83 years of age. My health being precarious and caring for them has put me what the government calls BPL(Below Poverty Level) I have no health insurance, denied ObamaCare, denied Medicaid because I'm BPL. My dream has been to write a book and I have done it. Bucket list one completed. Problem is the cost to self publish. I ran across this site through divine intervention. I pray someone hears my plea so that I could get published. The name of the book is, ""Murder in LA"" (Lower Alabama). Part one of a second book completion. Dorrance is my publisher and zero funds in my pocket. I wish I was able to work,however, health issues prevents it . I do volunteer at a literacy center to help people to read and get their GED's. The center just last month sent books to Central Louisanna for the flood victems. All funds received will go through me to Dorrance in the effort to get my book out there. This means everything to me. I've always wanted to write and entertain people. The funds are needed asap. If this venture was to be sucessful and I raise the funds my prayers and wishes for good karma to all who participated. Hopefully the book will do well and I will be able to do more for my parents and then maybe be able to pay for a doctor to see me.

                        Hi, my name is Sashai. I am a 30 year old single mother. After finally leaving an emotionally and physically abusive and toxic environment/relationship, and *having to use all of my savings* to pay bills due to financial abuse from my ex, and receiving no financial contribution to past rent and bills from my ex, my 9 year old daughter Giselle and I are unfortunately in jeopardy of losing our apartment. I have been and am still actively seeking employment and have applied for over 100 jobs so far with no luck after being laid off. I have never been in this position before where I've needed to ask for help, and it's not something that I would normally do; but, a series of unfortunate recent events have led to me needing help. Also for the sake of maintaining normalcy for my daughter by avoiding being evicted from our apartment, I am reaching out for help. Any money raised will be used solely to pay for our rent and utilities. It would mean the world to us if anyone is willing to help. Every little bit counts and we would appreciate anything that we receive. I would need to receive the funds as soon as possible, if possible at least $1300 by September 13, 2016 (that's last day to pay before landlord would file an eviction). My daughter's birthday is in two weeks September 15, and I would love for us to be in our home. Reaching out for help is not easy, but for the sake of my daughter it's something I know that I need to do. Any amount would be helpful and appreciated, and we will be grateful. Thank you.Sashai

                        My name is Debbie Cox. I am a science teacher in Independence, MO. I am raising money to help my friend and fellow science teacher, Valerie Hough, with medical bills from a car accident.Valerie was injured in an automobile accident on her way to school on April 6, 2016. A car recklessly pulled out in front of her, and Valerie's car was totaled in the accident. The Hwy Patrol issued the driver of the other car a Reckless Driving (C&I) ticket. To make matters worse, the driver of the other car had no insurance. (The other driver's coverage expired at 12:00 AM earlier that very morning!)The accident caused several bone fractures in Valerie's foot and ankle. Luckily, the cocoon of air bags prevented any life-threatening injuries to her head and upper body, although she had severe burns and bruising from the seat belt. (Val gave me permission to post some of her pics below.)Valerie must undergo surgery to repair the damage to the bones in her foot and ankle. We are hoping to raise $8,500 to cover the cost of her insurance deductible for doctor visits, medical equipment, hospital/surgery, and to help during her recovery until Valis able to return to work.Valerie is a dedicated teacher who was simply on her way to school when a careless driver changed everything. Please help us reach our goal so that Val can concentrate on her recovery, and so that she can get back to school and continue making a difference in the lives of children every day. Thank you for your consideration and support!Val is a hockey fan and dedicated high school science teacher.Just one of the many painful seat-belt abraisons that Val suffered during the accident.Val had several bone fractures in her foot and ankle.This is Val a day before herankle surgery.

                        My name is Wisam. I am from Iraq. In 2007 masked men doused my son, Youssif, in gasoline and set him on fire. He was barely five years old at the time. CNN covered my sons story and thanks to the generosity of CNN viewers we were able to come to Los Angeles and get treatment. We are so grateful for the help that we got, but we are struggling to make ends meet. Youssif still requires surgery and treatment and his doctors are close by and the community is used to him. He has his friends here and its hard for him to move into new environments where people stare and are uncomfortable around him, especially in his age group, which makes relocation really difficult. I am doing my best to take care of my family. I have been able to find part time work, but I have struggled to find a full time job. I am having a hard time making ends meet. I hope to one day havea full time job and I dream of the day when I can provide a permanenthome for my family.

                        My brother, Louis, was woken up in the middle of the night by a fireman banging on his door profusely. When he answered, the fireman told him the building was on fire and it was so bad it was too late for him to walk out, so he had to jump out of his second story window to safety. Thank the Lord for the fireman and that my brother woke up to the banging! First and foremost my brother is safe. However, the whole apartment building went up in flames and Lou has lost literally everything he owned. He has no clothes, no phone, no computer, etc. Not only that but he was a striving director and lost thousands and thousands of dollars worth of equipment, computer programs, and of course his own work, gone forever. I am trying to raise just some money as he is going to need a place to stay (he is out in California, all of his family is in New York), food, new clothes and a new phone, as well as have to apartment search. Losing everything can be stressful and heart wrenching but hopefully with your generosity we can make it just a little bit easier for my oldest brother.

                        Hello! My name is Jasmine (JAS). I'm 16 and an aspiring model from Homewood, AL. I have been afforded the opportunity to walk in shows at New York Fashion Week in September and am super excited about it. This is such a huge opportunity for me and has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl. I have always had a passion for fashion and a desire to model. I started my journey of becoming a professional model a little over a year ago and am working hard towards that goal. Modeling is the only thing that I really enjoy and I am excited about the growth that I have had over the last year. I have learned quite a bit about the industry and am still learning and working hard to perfect my craft. My goal is to be the next household name. When you say or hear the model ""JAS"" I want you to know exactly who that is.... Me. :) I am asking that you please consider making a donation to help fund my trip. I will be in New York for an entire week. Besides the shows that are already booked, I will be attending several different model castings while there. I'm looking forward to a very busy, productive week. The total cost for the trip will be $1,200. The monies will cover travel and also lodging for the week. I am hoping to reach that goal by August 29th. Any donation you can make is appreciated. No matter how big or small. Thank you so much for your continued encouragement and support. Anything is possible if you believe.

                        When Don was laid off the first time, we had our taxes to keep us afloat. When he was laid off this second time, we were ok for a little while, but the bills started piling up fast & now we can't catch up. We are in danger of losing our car, which we definitely cannot afford to happen. And now my car is starting to have problems again, so if we lose the Jeep & my car goes down, neither of us will be able to work because we won't have a way to get the kids home from the babysitter. Don recently got a job working where I do, but because we are so far behind on everything, we can't get ahead. What I'm trying to raise is just enough to get our bills caught up even. We have been trying to do everything ourselves & have avoided asking for help because that's not who we are, but at this point, I feel that if we don't try to get some help, we are going to lose everything. If you can donate, you will never understand how much it will mean to us...we just want to be able to get caught up so our kids can do the things they want to do because once we have all the bills paid up, they'll be able to. Alyssa wants to do cheer at the end of this school year for 8th grade, both she & Katrina want to do gymnastics & Logan wants to take some gymnastics classes too. And both Katrina & Logan want to do the after school program in the evenings & at this point I can't afford any of it & I'm so tired of telling my kids no because we can't afford it. So if you can help at all...it will mean the world to not only Don & myself, but our kids as well. Thank you

PORTLAND, OR                                




TAVEUNI, FIJI - 2016On February 21-22nd, 2016, cycloneWinstontore through the islands of Fiji and leftgreat destruction. One of the hardesthit islands, Taveuni (The Garden Island) was wiped cleanfrom extreme winds and rain that brought great amounts of corrosive salt water ashore -killing plants and destroying baselinefoodsuppliessush as bananas, papaya and mango trees. It will take months for the vegetation to return and a full growing cycle for crops to replenish.TAVEUNI, FIJI - 2016Worstofall, South Taveuni lacks fresh water resources and they are dependent upon watertrucked-infrom the North side of the island. In the wake of the storm, precious water supplies havedwindled due to closed roads and failed infrastructure and the only simple solution for fresh water is desalination. TAVEUNI, FIJI - 2016This campaign has a fewbasicgoals - to educate the local population of Tavenui on thebasicmethod of extracting fresh water from sea water via simple steam desalination and provide them the supplies to do so. We willteach them how to boiland condense it and catch the clean water. In no time at all, freshwater can bemadeand the process can be recreated on a small or large scale. Funds raised here will go to the purchase of basic materials to create portable desalination kits,travel expenses for a fewrelief workers+educators, water treatment products and portable shelters. We will address what the needs are as we go and use our discretionhow thefunds will be spent on the people of Taveuni whohavelost everything, including their jobs and income. All proceeds will be spenton the reliefeffort!The steam desalination method is quite simple and begins with a pan or tankof sea water that's covered infoil or a metallic surface with a flexible tube throughthe topthat allows moisture to escape the pot as steam and travel toward the catch container. The process happensby boiling water on awood burningsurface, which causes the water vapor to rise and enter thenarrow tube as hot vapor. Further down the tube, acooledcondenser area chillsand causes the water to become clean, clear liquid again, which in-turn drips into a catch device.The simplest method to do this is with aluminum foil, rubber tubing and a water bottle or jar to catch the clean water. When steam is formed, it leaves behind salt and impurities that exist as particulatesand generates water that is clean and fresh, much like a cloud does when it rains.TAVEUNI, FIJI - 2015What we might see as simple inthe US, is not so in a developing country where supplies are hard to come by, expensive and the knowledge base is very limited. Our intent is to take these supplies to Fiji and show thepeoplehow toset up their own systemsandmaintain them. Our teamwill also help with the hands-on rebuilding effort and we will provide as many shelter tents and tarps as our funding will provide.Please support thiscause and know that100% of your donations will go to help these struggling people. No money will be spent on salaries, frivolous supplies or go to anyuse, other than helping Fijians rebuild their homes and their lives.THANK YOU, WITHLOVE LOVE LOVE!Ommmmmm :)My name isClark James and I created this projectwith the support of mydear friends, with the sharedgoal of showing love forall people and supporting the citizens of Fiji as they recover from this storm.

My name is Gina Rubel, and I was in a horrific freak car accident that almost took my life on April 4th, 2016. I was on my way home and was only five houses away from my house which was a block over. For the record, my toxicology report came back completely clean and sober as I AM clean and sober. A few blocks earlier, a leatherpartof my sandal got stuckon the accelerator and I could not wiggle it free. In my panic and haste, unbeknownst to me, I ended up speeding ultimatelyhittingthe guard rail thatlinesthe heavy curve of the road to the left. 


I landed on top the curved guard rail hitting a light pole (which was behind the guard rail) knocking out power to three grid blocks of my neighborhood. The pole snapped towards the top causing the lamp and half pole to fall onto my car windshield missing my head by a foot. Mycar was completely totaled. I thank the heavens above that my nine year old son was not in the car as he could have been killed. We are also rescue dog parents as of this last summer, her name is Angel. We couldnt be happier with her as she is a wonderful dog. Unfortunately, I am unable to take her for walks as of right now. 


My lower legs and ankles were crushed and I lost tremendous amounts of blood. My left and right Tibia bones came thru my skin at my knee joints. I had terrible compound breaks of both my ankles as my Tibia and Fibula came out of my skin on both sides of my ankles. My right foot was literally hanging off, all twisted backwards and only attached by a two inch piece of skin and muscle tissue. 


The airbag broke my sternum and the majority of my frontal ribs. Amongst other heavy lacerations, I also broke my left hand and endured a severe concussion. Due to my amount of blood loss, I ended needing two units of blood. My lungs collapsed twice while on the operating table which resulted in them giving me a tracheotomy. I was hooked up to 12 machines at one point for a few days as I almost didnt make it. I swelled up like a balloon because my body endured a tremendous amount of trauma. It took them three operations, scheduled apart on separate days, to repair my ankles and legs because they were such a mess (as my surgeon stated.) My lungs are still not right, neither is my sternum. It will take a while for that to fully heal. I have also lost so much hair due to stress that it can fill a pillow which is quite depressing. 


I was in a coma for three and a half weeks while in the hospital. After a little over a month of being in the hospital they moved me to a rehabilitation home where I finished out the majority of my therapy. In all, I was hospitalized and rehabbed for over three months and I lost over 35 lbs due to trauma and stress. I am still in need of additional physical therapy as I have trouble walking. My insurance is unwilling to pay for home health care physical therapy, so I'm pretty much on my own at this point. I have a gym membership and they have a pool. The water will alleviate my weight on my knee and ankle joints. I plan on first walking laps in the pool to strengthen my legs, knees and ankles. I will also be doing range of motion exercises (ROM) in the pool and include freestyle swimming. Eventually, I will move to the recumbent exercise bikes, but yet still do my routine in the pool. I will change and tailor my routine as I become stronger and am able to do more. 


I am humbly and graciously asking for monetary donations for my medical expenses, care for my son, my gym expenses (physical therapy), and maybe a car. I need to be able to get around, especially to get to the gym for my physical therapy. I have nothing, no emergency funds whatsoever to help myself as I am a single mother living pay to pay. I also dont have family support to help with funds. I need to be able to make it to the gym for my physical therapy, doctor appointments, grocery shopping, and activities with my son, errands, and work (once Im cleared to go back), etc. 


It would mean the world to me should you be able to donate, and to quite literally, help me get back on my feet. I am aPatient Care Tech (PCT),Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and Phlebotomist, but I STILL struggle as a single mother. Especially now more than ever due to my accident. I have helped many patients with my unconditional empathy and understanding, but now, I am the one who needs the help. 


Please, I humbly ask for your help in monetary donations. Any amount will be very muchly appreciated, i.e. $5, $10, $20, $25, $50, $80, $100, $150, $200, or more. The sky's the limit as beggars cannot be choosers. I am so very thankful and grateful for your donation. Im also very thankful to be ALIVE! Thank you for your empathy, compassion and understanding. You really have no idea how much this would help me and my son. 


Thank you so very kindly and God Bless, 


Very Sincerely,
Gina Rubel

"Vandalized by Trump Supporters,$630,$630,Other," August 8, 2016",15,1,WINDHAM,NH,214000,,5,"

WINDHAM, NH                                




Thank you to all who donated and shared! Your kindness, support and generosity has been overwhelming from the start. 


We originally were trying to raise $500, but when we got some crazy quotes, the goal increased to $2,000. When we found a less expensive repair, and all we needed was $600, I withdrew from the GoFundMe, and we were able to makeup the difference. 


Thank you so very much. <3 


Here is the story:
My 2006 Chrysler Town and Country was vandalized by Trump Supporters while visiting my Aunt at Wakeforest Baptist Hospital's Cancer Center in Winston-Salem, NC. 


Here is the damage:
""TRUMP"" carved into:
Hood, Driver's Door, Hatch. 


Hate symbols:
Swastika & Iron Cross on Drivers side rear quarter panel. 


Keyed lines on: 
Hood, Drivers Side front and rear quarter panels, Driver's door, Drivers side slider, passenger side quarter front and rear panels, passenger's door, passenger side slider. 


I am from New Hampshire, and I came down to North Carolina to help take care of my Aunt. 


Within my first six hours of being in North Carolina I was yelled at by three different people:
""F*CKING YANKEE! GO HOME!!"" 
""YANKEE PIECE OF SH*T!!"" 
""YANKEE B*TCH! THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN!!"" 


It's sad to see such anger and hate in this country, and being a target of such hate feels so violating. 


I was a target because I am a ""Yankee"" and I have a ""Bernie 2016"" sticker on the back. 


Originally, this campaign was to raise $500 for the deductible and any other expenses. We had no idea that the damage would have been this costly. Our insurance company issued us a check for $1,473 to cover what could be covered, and the rest was up to us. 


We found a less expensive repair and the van is currently in the process of being repaired, and repainted. 


Thank you all so much <3
With out your support, none of this would have been possible.

DAYTON, OH                                





                        Hello! My name is Justin. I have simple desires I'm aiming to achieve in life; which are to travel the country, experience different culture and create music, while applying my skills in construction to fund my goals along the way. At the age of 27, and after a year of sobriety I feel I am ready both mentally and physically to finally set off on my adventure. I bought a van and converted the inside to become my home. I have been living in my van for 3 months now becoming accustom to this way of life before hitting the road. My departure date I set to leave was September 7th. Unfortunately, I have fallen into a bit of a bad luck streak and have had many setbacks. The opportunity to finally get me started was two weeks of construction work I had landed, only to be unexpectedly cut short to 3 days due to a major miscommunication. I took a huge pay cut of 1500 dollars. Since then, my van has also recently broke down, leaving me infront of a buddy's home in Columbus, Ohio. I currently have 42 dollars to my name. Although in the short time I've been here I have landed a full time construction job. My new goal was is to push back the leave date until I make up enough to get caught back up, which I had no problems with but after a recent phone call it has become personally urgent for me to make it to Henderson, Nevada. A recent turn of events has left my father homeless. My father means everything to me. So my travels aside this gofund me is primarily to get my van fixed and get to my father. In motion to leave as soon as possible and struggling to overcome setback after setback, I hope for the amount above to help pay for the work needed on my van with any left over to go towards the drive to my dad. While this fund is posted I WILL still BE WORKING day in and out to raise money towards my goal. I will not be lazily sitting checking my go fund me every second. I work for a living. I just need a helping hand to speed up the process so i can reach my father sooner. Thank you everyone. Feel free to share please.

YPSILANTI, MI                                




My friend Salli Christenson has been hounding me to do a GoFundMe effort and has offered to run it for me. All I had to do was write this for her:Hi! This is Ro Nagey and I am asking you a big favour. I need your help. Please.I have been lying about the extent of my disability. I guess I need to be honest.I am almost at the point of needing a wheelchair to get around. I can barely walk 30 feet and thats almost always with a three-wheeled Zimmerman frame. I am also bound by debt. I am not just broke but deeply in debt. Ive been trying to act as if I was normal - both in physical and financial health - but Im not.* For those of you who saw me at LonCon, I am now someone much weaker. I hate how bad off Ive become physically. Recently, Ive been offered the chance to live in an assisted-living facility. I dont want to admit it but its time for me to move there. And I need your help. I need to get out of debt and also afford the movers so I can live there. However, I also want to go to Kansas City, MO this August to participate in the 74th Science Fiction Worldcon, MidAmeriCon II. Its perfect symmetry as I did my very first WorldCon panel at MidAmeriCon I, exactly 40 years ago, where I interviewed John Brunner.I've been asked to moderatea panel on Generation Starships based, in part, on the success we had at the LonCon Worldcon two years ago. That's my other goal. If I can raise the full amount, I will be able to make a sidetrip to Ann Arbor, the city where I went to Uni and where I helped create the Stilyagi Air Corps and the still-running some 40-years-later convention: ConFusion.Perhaps fatalistically, I am calling this my Ro: One Last Time tour. There are friends I want to see and friends I need to make amends to. If I can go to Kansas City and, hopefully, Ann Arbor, I can do both and return to Wales with a clean slate and the satisfaction of doing one last convention panel at a WorldCon. I would like to gather enough funding in the next 30 days so I can confirm with the Con that I will be there. I love America and miss it so. I love my American friends and especially those in fandom.** I will not be able to go if I can't raise the money. And the timing is perfect. I suffer from a degenerative back condition and I imagine I shall be in a wheelchair sooner rather than later. Now is the perfect time. Its probably the last time. As a way of showing thanks, I will publish a lengthy trip report upon my return and either mail or email it to each of you. I will also be posting pictures and stories all during my trip. That is only a small expression of how thankful I will be for your generous donations. If you don't have any money, that's cool, too. I know that if you did, you'd help me out.Please, if you can, donate what you can. I can not begin to thank you enough. Ro Nagey*Okay, I walked into that. Ive never been normal but you all know what I mean. ;)**Facebook friends will also know how much I crave American food! My need for meat that hasnt been boiled and vegetables that arent roots is astounding.

                        Passionate about entrepreneurship, and a need to work from home has lead me in this direction. Though I'm not needing funeral expenses or a transplant, thank God! I have a disease called Psoriatic Arthritis which is a chronic inflammatory and pain disease. To the point...it's hard to work outside of the home, which I currently do. I am saving slowly to start selling a specific line of clothing from my home, which will allow me the flexibility I need with my disease and still provide for my 3 children. Please help! I was SOOO worried about asking for help! I've always been very proud, I spoke to someone who encouraged me to ask for help to make my goal and dream come true. I hope you find it in your heart to help me! I'm grateful for this opportunity to share my story! Love to all.

I am disabled, 65 years old, and live by myself. My Social Security and SSI are insufficient to get me through the month. Since I was forced to go on Medicare, my funding stream has taken a bad hit. I no longer have money for groceries after my food stamps run out, which is usually halfway through the month. I have a number of special dietary requirements due to my medical conditions, so the foods I buy are sometimes more expensive than I could get otherwise. In addition, I have no money to pay for clothing, gasoline, haircuts, and other such necessities. I have not been able to pay for the over the counter medications that my insurance does not cover. I have been unable to get to my psychologist appointments sinse August 2013. I have been unable to get to my daily chiropractor treatments for severe injuries since November 2013.

                        Hi, my name is Lori DeBrock-Starr. I am a single mother of three beautiful children. I find myself in an overwhelming situation that leads me to needing to create this page. I was living in Howell, NJ and the house that I was renting did not renew the lease. I had to make some very difficult decisions and I temporarily moved in with a friend. What was supposed to be a brief transition, turned into me caring for my friends elderly, sick Mother. My friend has been put on temporary disability, so this is the perfect opportunity for me to move on with my life. Unfortunately, I have not been working outside of the home and dont have the finances I need to get a place of my own OR a car to get to and from a job. I cannot go to any one friend and ask for help, since it is far larger an obligation than I can ask of any 1 person. Therefore, I was given the idea of gofundme.com. I honestly cant thank you enough for reading my story. If you could find it in your heart to help me, I promise, after I get settled, to make this a new beginning of paying it forward, as you have done for me!

                        We're the Wright-Hendrix's and we need a little help. Last year, after the birth of our youngest son Micheal, we found out that he has G6PD deficiency. This deficiency is a X-chromosome linked disorder, which means not only does he have it, but so do I and my other two sons. Only my husband and daughter don't have it. G6PD causes anemia when exposed to certain foods and chemicals. No more soy, beans, peanuts, peas, vaporub, artificial mint, or blue food coloring, or we risk a trip to the hospital. It explained a lot of problems we've had over the years. However this greatly limits the amount of foods we can eat. Almost every single processed item contains soy or peanuts. Bread, mayo, chocolate; if it's easy we can't eat it. This includes school lunches. Luckily we like to make things from scratch, and do it very well too. Unluckily, our food bill has gone up considerably as everything must be freshly made. We have to make our own hot dogs and sausages, dry our own instant mash, make our own boullion, etc. Due to school starting and all those wonderful school supplies, clothing, and someone cloning our debit card and freezing our account, we are currently behind and for the next couple of months we have to choose between groceries and rent/transportation. We only need a little bit to break close to even. But it will help us combat the vitamin deficiencies brought on by no longer eating all these foods. Please help!

My brother Larry died alone in our family home on Friday, July 8, 2016. He wasn't well mentally, a Purple Heart Vietnam Vet who never really got over that experience, but I loved him with all my heart. His body wasn't discovered until twodays laterbut with no a/c in the house and the extreme heat..... 
As a result, the house has been deemed a ""biohazard."" A professional company must be hired to clean & sanitize it. I can't even go inside the house at this point. It's not just because (nor how) he died in the house. It's also because of the way he lived in it. The service will cost upwards of $10,000 and I simply don't have the money. I have lost both my parents and now my only brother over the past 23 months. I will be eternally grateful if you can help me with this. It's not an easy thing to do- to ask for help- but here I am... asking. 
It's been a rough ten years caring for my parents and my brother. I am anxious to get the house situation dealt with before City Officials get involved.


Thank you in advance for any help you can give, whether it's a donation or by sharing this page with others. I am forever indebted to and grateful for my friends.


Sincere thanks, 
Debbie

                        I'm a divorced mom of two amazing girls that have gone through hell the past couple of years. Ever since the divorce of their father and I, I've been battling with him out of court about their wellbeing. He creates chaos and instability. I've been trying to make their lives as stable as possible. He's fought back for almost 5 years now, threatening that if I take him to court, he'll keep me there until I'm bankrupt. He was able to make this threat, and be taken seriously by me, because he comes from money and his parents will back him. I, on the other hand, don't. I don't have a rich family or the kind of friends that have $10,000 lying around to lend to me. That's why I'm here! My kids have both struggled with the split week schedule, Mon/ Tue at dad's house, Wed/Thu at mom's and every other Fri-Sun it switches. It's caused missed homework from school, This became especially difficult 2 years ago when my ex moved out of the school district and into a house with his girlfriend and her two sons. She has done some pretty nasty things to my girls including calling them names and isolating them from their dad. My home is their only safe space, where they feel loved and are allowed to be kids! It's in their best interest to have a daily routline. I want them to wake up in their own beds every morning for school, eat a healthy breakfast, then walk the half a block to the bus stop, and start their day in a positive way with me waving them off to school.  Exasperating this already stressful situations for two young girls, my oldest who is 11, has been bullied at school and emotionally needs a lot of support, which she does not get from her dad. She has been suicidal and has started self harming. I had to take the firzt half of the year off from work in order to be there for her as she struggled to make it to school and spent 7 days in a crisis center. Her dad didnt change anything about his work schedule, regular life routine, or the living environment at his house. She has had access to things she can harm herself with and has used them on more then one occasion. This is the reason I'm now fighting through the court system to gain full custody. Since March, when I filed with the court, I've spent a little over $7000 in attorney fees and expenses. Which has wiped me out completely...and he's still going strong, stringing the process along to make sure I can't afford to keep fighting. Meanwhile, he's getting ready to move into a custom built 5 bedroom/5 bath home even further from the girls' school. He doesn't care about what's best for the girls, he just cares about being right. This is an ego battle to him. I'm desperately asking for help paying my attorney. This is not for me, it's for the girls! That's always been my number one concern. This could easily end up costing upwards of another $15,000 on top of what I've already paid, and I just can't afford it on my own.Please, help make sure I'm able to keep fighting for what I know to be the best situation for my girls. Thank you so much for your time, prayers, and donations.

His way to help was to purchase as much water as he could load in his flatbed truck and take it to Columbia. Others have reached out asking for ways to support the Columbia community and Andy is willing to make another trip to assist with providing water as currently 40,000 people are without clean water. All funds will go to future trucks and not his initial donation. He will donate the truck, gas and labor as well to get the water to Columbia.

                                                Sometimes its hard to ask for help. You live through your mothers battles with ovarian cancer and death. You live through your younger sisters successful battle with ovarian cancer. Then youre diagnosed with Breast Cancer. And not just any type, HER2 Positive. Its so small, and so early, yet youre told that because of the location youll have to have a mastectomy. You decide to be proactive and have a double mastectomy with concurrent reconstruction (26 hours of surgery). Nothing is text book, there are issues in surgery and in recovery, though you are happy in the knowledge that it was caught early and didnt spread. You go home and recover. You begin chemo, and are entered into a major international drug protocol study, that could change the course of treatment for thousands upon thousands of women. That gets you through the rough days. You go back to work, except you dont get to enjoy the part of your job that you love the most and has led you into the lives of countless members of the theatre community. Your family rallies around you and uplifts you. For months upon months, you follow the same routine. Then one day you begin to have headaches, small and persistent at first, then so bad it feels as if your head is being crushed. No drug touches the pain. Oh, goody, more tests. You now have a more complications. You suffer the indignities ofradiation therapy. You enter a new drug study. Theres a small set back and you have targeted radiation therapynothing like getting zapped with radiation to keep your spirits up. The drugs are strong and fight, yet they almost take your life by dehydration. You fight back and return to a semblance of normalcy. Then you abruptly lose your job. No income, no health insurance, reams of paper to fill out to have each treatment covered and every pill paid for by some philanthropic drug giant. You continue to fight...This is not some scary bedtime story, this is the story of my best friend for over twenty years: Wendy Gentile Vandergrift.It has been a hard journey for her and our family. And now we face even more daunting challenges: FINANCIAL.This fund is to help with the medical and mortgage debt that has piled fairly high compared to what we have to give. I'm working 70 hours a week, and it doesn't stretch far enough.We're stepping forward to ask the help of our friends to stave off legal battles with medical creditors and keep them at bay, , and to keep our house (which we are in imminent danger of losing). This is also for Wendy's sister, who lives with us. For obvious reasons, our path to local assistance is awkward at best. However, we have reached out to some national funding sources within the theatre community, and hope to be able to secure some assistance going forward.The goal is set right at what we need to get us through the crisis at hand, and we want to see how close we can get in the next 48 hours.

                        We are trying to help my niece. Please consider helping or sharing.Last month this beautiful little girl unexpectedly lost her mom. Her mom was a single parent and meant the world to her. Since her mom's passing, we have taken her into our home and are filing for custody and will hopefully raise her as our own. We want her to have a safe and happy childhood. We want her to have the best opportunities and to always feel safe. I have to fight for custody and unfortunately, I don't have the means to pay the attornies. We fear the worst will happen for her if we can't continue. I am doing everything in my power to honor her mothers wishes, keep her safe and with people that will love her and care for her every day of her life. We need some help. We have a huge financial burden that we can't handle alone. If you can, please consider donating. Please know that every dollar helps and 100% of it will go to help this little girl stay safe, healthy and happy. If you are unable to donate, please consider sharing this page. Bless you all and thank you so much.

                        Hello Everyone,We want to start this by saying that the past few days have been an absolute blur and while we try to wrap our heads around everything the outpouring of support has been astounding. As most know, on Saturday evening David, Benjamin and I returned home from a fantastic day out. As far as family fun days go, our Saturday started ourperfect. However, once we turned down ourdrive to take us home...we drove straight into what has become a nightmare. We were met byfire trucks, ambulances and chaos. Intriguid by all the excitement at first, we were then told there was a fire in one of the condo buildings...ours, when asked by an officer for our address we could tell by his immediate reaction, this was not good. Our home was gone, it was to be boarded up that night and what was on our backs and in our hands became our only possessions. Nothing has been more humbling than what happened after the fire. I think the initial shock has still not worn off and we are very much on autopilot trying towrap our heads around our new reality, but we have to say beyond a shadow of a doubt the amount of calls and texts and emails and hugs and love and support that we have been shown has been absolutely overwhelming.David and I wish we could give a more clear and concise answer when asked what we need exactly, but with so much still unclear for us in the coming months, the best we can suggest is support. Thank you, we are eternally grateful for everything you have already done for us. With Love and Gratitude,Dave, Britt and Ben

The system that is in place to protect and defend childrens' rights to grow and develop in a nurturing, loving, safe, and peaceful environment is failing our children.  It has transformed into a system to protect parent's rights but somehow, it is not utlitmately concerned with protecting the rights of the children. There are domestic violence laws in place to protect adults from being battered and abused yet there are laws in place in many of our states that allow children to be abused at the hands of those that are SUPPOSEDto protect them. I have exhausted all of my savings to defend and protect my 3 year old daughter from being abused by her father, and prevent her siblings from witnessing and/or being blamed for her abuse.  I am desperate for help to defend my childrens' rights to grow and thrive without fear. I need help to pay my neverending attorney fees and to eventually move in a more financially and emotionally stable environment. Please help me defend my childrens' rights.I am the mother of 5 beautiful girls...4 that walk and 1 that flutters and flies.7 months after the death of my daughter, I got the shock of my life when I discovered that not only was I pregnant, but I was pregnant with 2 babies. I discovered a few months after my twins' birth that their father, my then husband, had serious and very troubling addiction issues. After many pleas that he seek help and the assuring him that I would support him through treatment/therapy, he refused to fight for his family. I felt no other option than to take my children and leave to a more stable environment.It is so very difficult to condense a very long and difficult story but approximately a year ago, when my twin daughter's were 2, one of them came home with welts and bruises up her back and down her legs. I was shocked when the children told me that they came from their father.  Since then, my same daughter has come home several times with bruises and behavior that was indicative of an abused child. CPS has been called by their pediatrician twice and because of the antiquated laws on discipline in many states, CPS did not deem it as serious abuse. 50 years of research on the subject has found that this type of abuse is damaging and children become adults that carry lifelong physical AND emotional scars. The children have reported that my daughter has been dragged, knocked into furniture, pulled by her hair, held down, and hit in the head with pans by their father. It was in January, shortly after she came home with bruises again, that she pled with me that I not send her to his home. It was then that I made the decision to end their visits to his home. I filed for an emergency protection order but it was denied because the pictures, videos, witnesses, and communication with the children were not permitted in that court. I still refused to send my very bright, gorgeous, precocious, strong-willed, and spirited daughter and her very emotional, sensitive and precocious twin sister to be in the care of their father unsupervised. However, I have given him the option of visiting with the girls in public places. He asked to see them twice in a 3 month period. He has yet to admit any wrong-doing and while on trial, admitted to ""popping her on the butt at least a dozen times in the last year"".  He has gone far beyond ""love taps"". He continues to deny any responsibility in his IN-ABILITY to maintain control, whether it be controlling his addictions or simply, disciplining a typical toddler.  He has also begun blaming my 8 year old for putting bruises on her sister. I have already depleted my savings fighting this in court and have put almost $9000 towards protecting my daughters.  I am facing losing representation because I can no longer afford to pay my attorney. However, I believe it is my duty and responsibility to keep all of my children safe, secure, and for them to feel loved at all times. My ex continues to fight this and I risk eventually, going to jail by not sending them to be in his care. I can no longer maintain my home (which I bought 2 yrs ago). I have missed many days of work because of this and it's projected that if I go to trial, I could potentially miss up to 3 wks of work. I am a teacher and was able to find better paying employment in a community that supports and values family. I'm hoping to get court approval to move so that I can provide stability and protection for my children. When I notified my ex of my need to move and to work out a schedule for him to visit the children in the city where I plan to move, he filed a motion asking for full-custody. I've exhaused every resource that I know that is in place to protect children and its been and endless route to nowhere. Because my daughter wasn't seriously physically injured, or murdered YET, no organization seems to be significantly concerned. 50 years of research on the subject has brought the long-term effects of spanking/abuse into light and findings are alarming. Yet, no laws have been changed to prevent the phsycial and emotional damage of spanking and abuse. I am asking for support in paying my non-ending court costs and to eventually, relocate, and provide emotional and financial stability for my girls. My daughter's middle name means peace and my obligation to do everything within my power to protect and defend her right to have a childhood full of happiness, love, and PEACE. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my very long story.Anonimity is only necessary because I fear retalliation from my ex-husband, who is extremely vengeful. A FB page was created specifically for gofundme. Feel free to message me with any questions and validation.

Louisiana, more specifically, Denham Springs, Louisiana.Denham Springs is at the epicenter of the flooding that occured in Louisiana last weekend. Those floods are whereI grew up. I have so many friends and family that lost so much. When you are being rescued by helicopter or boat, there is only so much you can take. Many people are just returning to their homes to find everything they owned destroyed, including their homes. Some haven't made it that far. Here are some stats:* 31% of homes within the nine parishes (counties) are located in areas identified as receiving flooding.* More than 110,000 homes are located in the flooded areas.* As a whole, the estimated total value of those homes located in areas identified as flooded is $20.7 billion.* 280,910 Baton Rouge arearesidents live in areas identified as receiving flooding.All monies raised will go to my family and friendsget their homes back in order. If you would like to know specifically whom before you donate, feel free to reach out to me. If you can donate, please do. If you can't, we understand as well.GoFundMe likes full disclosure to minimize scammers which I can appreciate. So full disclosure: Funds will be withdrawn to myself for dispersement, because they don't support dispersing to multiple people at this time. We will split the funds between multiplefamilies.If you don't really know me and may be concerned I may be a shady character and will use the funds to further my hopes of being an Olympic curler, I can understand your reservation. Please donate to a reputable organization such as the Red Cross if you can.Many thanks for anything you can give.Ron Delvisco

CANONSBURG, PA                                




This was the living room at Lee Wilson's house. The fire started in the living room behind the television at 1 am on Sep 17, 2016. Lee head 3 loud pops, ran into the living room and saw smoke and flames behind the television coming from the outlet. She tried to smother it with a blanket but the fire overtook the blanket and shot up the wall into the ceiling. Thick black smoke immediately filled the room and the house. Lee is a cat rescuer and volunteers for Fix 'Ur Cat. She is a member of the Canonsburg Cat Committee. She had 24 cats in her house at the time of the fire. These cats were all rescues, fulled vetted and spayed/neutered. Every cat was lost in the fire. The house and all the contents are a total loss. Lee got out with the clothes on her back and is staying with a cousin temporarily. She is in mourning over her cats. So far we have recovered 17 cat bodies from the house. They are being buried at Oak Spring Cemetery in Canonsburg. Lee is in need of monetary donations though she would never ask. She lives on very little income and has no savings. Anything anyone can give will be much appreciated.

"A Tree Chasing Her Roots ,"$1,250","$2,500",Wishes," August 4, 2016",18,1,FORT LAUDERDALE,FL,71000,,1,"

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL                                





                        My name is Idell W. Gayman and I am a recent graduate of Barry University where I earned a Masters of Public Health and a Masters of Health Services Administration. Before Barry University I attended Florida A & M University located in the beautiful Tallahassee, fl. There, I earned my bachelors in Health Science. I am a VERY proud Rattler and I credit FAMU with teaching me the true meaning of hard work, humility, perseverance and community fellowship. Before that, I attended Chaminade Madonna College Preparatory for high school where I first discovered my faith and the true power of Gods love.Out of all the different facets which make up my lifes story, the one in which I am proudest of is my African heritage. Both my mother and my father came to american as African immigrants seeking a better life. My mothers legacy is a living testament to the real life possibilities the American Dream affords those who are willing to work for it. Before I begin working professionally, I would love to use this brief period in time to travel and visit my homeland. Our culture is a beautiful culture and it has always been my lifes dream/goal to go too Africa and walk the same path as my mom and grandmother. As my aunts and uncles and all those who came before me.Although I have been afforded the best of opportunities, nothing in this world is free. I plan to be gone for 30 days and I have successfully saved $1,400 on my own. This is a major feat for someone who was a full time graduate student and did not work. I am currently short of my goal and finally decided to humble myself enough to ask my family and friends for help. Since I hold my degrees in Public Health and Health Services Administration, it is also imperative that I utilize my time in Africa to learn as much as I can about the local people and their healthcare system. As most know, Liberia was paralyzed by the Ebola epidemic which consumed the country in 2014. It is important for me to gain as much practical knowledge about that time period, the recovery process and the lasting effects Ebola has had on the country. The knowledge and experience I gain there will be invaluable, as I intend to bring those ideas and experiences back and incorporate them into my professional life here in America.Contributions of any kind are greatly appreciated and I want to sincerely thank everybody for your continual support and love. Specials thanks to God above all, for all his blessing and guidance which have lead me my entire life.Sincerely, Idell W. Gayman

                        Hi, my name is Brian. I am trying to raise $680 for my friend who is wanting to take her United States Citizenship test. She was born and raised in Laos. She came to the United States legally, waited the appropriate length of time subscribed by law, and has worked hard studying. She has been legally employed in the United States since she first arrived here several years ago. She is a hard worker and loves the United States. Although $680 may not seem like much to many, it is a lot to her. She does not make that much income and her living expenses take almost all of her income. She has no idea I am trying to raise the funds for the Citizenship test. My hope is to eliminate the financial stress and provide her with the ability to focus on the test and becoming a legal citizen in the country she loves. Thank you for your consideration. This is truly one of those life changing moments for her.

WARRENSBURG, MO                                





                        I am a 17 year old FtM transgender. I came out in August 2015 and I will be raising the money for my top surgery on my own, which, if you do not know, is a surgical procedure to remove the breast tissue that I bind all hours of the day. I would absolutely LOVE to be able to reach my goal by summer, and I am hopping that my fairly large number of followers on instagram can help me reach that goal.The surgery it's self is about $6,000, however, it is located in Texas, and I happen to live in Missouri. A plane ticket is required for three people (my mother, father, and me), or gas money and a hotel for 7 days because the doctor requires a week post OP check up.I'm hoping $8,000 would cover most of the costs considering I have a free one way flight through north western because I had to cancel one last summer.Please help me, even just one dollar can make a difference

CHULA VISTA, CA                                





                        On Sunday, June 12, 2016, Brenda Araiza and her children lost their home of 15 years to a fire. This firequickly spread from one end to another, engulfing their home completely, and flaring up too intensely for them torescue their beloved pet Roxy, an English bulldog.The loss of Brenda's home has createdurgent financial needs! Withoutinsurance for her home, she is now in a situation where she will need to raise $8,000 just for the demolition and debris removal of her home from the lot. The mobile home park where her home is will be serving her in the next few days with a notice to demolish and clear all debris from the property. She must comply within seven days of that notice before they start to fine her. Once the lot is clear, she will need to establish a new home from scratch, as most of the family's possessions were destroyed in the fire. Anything above the $8K needed for the cleanup will go to setting up her new home, including deposits/down payments, furniture, appliances and clothing. (The initial goal is $8,650 includes the fees charged by GoFundMe of 7.9%.)The stress of this impending demand from the city, along with the stress of trying to find and furnish a new home for herself and two children, isa lotfor someone to handle alone, and that is why we are asking for your help! In addition to the fire, Brenda has also beentrying to overcome a series of recent challenges which include the loss of her father, unemployment, and a partial amputation due to medical issues. We know that God will provide, and we know that He most oftendoes it through people. Please help us extend God's love to Brenda by supporting the restoral of a home for her and the kidsafter such a devasting and unexpected loss.
