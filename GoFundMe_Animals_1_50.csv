Help Us To Help Sweet Stevie,"$3,695 ","$5,500 ",Animals," September 16, 2016",108,8,TACOMA,WA,478000,,,"

                        At only two years old, Stevies life had not been easy. One day, he was found tied to a lamp post, left unwanted. His owners were found, and they did not want him back. They also admitted to cutting Stevie's ears off with a pair of scissors when he was a puppy, hoping to make him look mean.From there, Stevie was taken to a local shelter, where he began to show signs of a possible neurological disorder. At first, a brain tumor was suspected. He was very wobbly and unable to move his legs the way a two-year-old dog should. Being in the shelter with limited medical care available, Stevies chances of being adoptable were slim to none. The volunteers and shelter staff could see what a sweet and special boy he was, and they became his voice--looking for a rescue that would help him, not wanting to give up hope that he could find the love and happiness he deserved. One volunteer even paid, out of her own pocket, for an MRI to be done. The MRI revealed the true cause  a tumor located at the base of his neck causing the neurological challenges. It was not cancer. It was not terminal, either, as long as the tumor was removed quickly before it had the chance to grow and become inoperable.Dr. Hicks and Dr. DeVibiss of Blue Pearl offered Stevie a discounted surgery. A wonderful family came forward and offered to foster Stevie during his recovery period. The surgery was successful! Aside from the $4,500 surgery, Stevie will need follow-up care, including water therapy and a personal dog trainer that is helping him learn how to live life free from being chained.We want to thank Dr. Hicks and Dr. DeVibiss of Blue Pearl of Tacoma, Shannon of Animal Kind Training, Leigh Anne of Splash Dogs of Edmonds, and Erin Pryor and her family for welcoming Stevie into their home and showing him love while he rehabilitates. Last, but not least, A HUGE THANK YOU to the volunteers and employees at the Tacoma-Pierce County Humane Society for not giving up on Stevie and providing his care while we worked on the coordination of saving this precious live. This is an amazing story of compassion and a community coming together. We truly cannot save these lives alone. Any donation in any amount will help us to recover from these expensesso that we can help another. There are dogs needing our help each and every day who deserve a chance, just like Stevie.There are a few ways to contribute to Stevies care.

                        Meet my best friend of 6 years, Chase Mutley. To most he is a dog or simply a pet, and while this is true, I know him as my best friend, to my daughter he is ""brother"". He is family. Chase was hit by a car this past Friday night. He yelped and frantically ran to us. We weren't prepared for what we saw, all I know is that in that instant our lives were shaken with fear and sadness. The entire right side of his hip and straight down to his paw, the fur and skin had become completely detached from his body, his leg bone exposed. I called 911 and the dispatcher tried contacting Chase's local vet for me being that it was after hours on a Friday night. She regretfully informed me that due to his doctor's policy, (despite knowing that a family may be watching their loved one pass away) because Chase had not been there for a visit in the last 2 years, he was denying him service. The closest emergency vet care open was an hour and a half away. Unlike his ""vet"" we were going to do anything and everything possible to save my best friend. That drive was difficult to say the least but I was more than thankful that we made it with Chase still alive. The doctor informed us that he suffered a severe laceration that would require at least a 3 day stay of suturing and draining on top of a bruised lung and broken pelvis. Best case scenario is the tissue will take, no infection, and then outpatient care at a local vet. However, no surgery would be administered until a deposit of $1,500 was made and the estimated sum of that best case scenario, $5,000. Day 1 and we are already at $3,000 in charges. I don't know what will happen and BC the doctor's don't either, we were informed that the expenses would rise. I don't know how much the ending costs will total but I do know that Chase is the most loyal companion and would protect me with his own life and that is what we are trying to do for him. Here I am angered at the role money plays in my ""dog's"" care and survival yet I sit here trying to figure out how to ask for help. People failed my buddy in this process but I believe I'm not the only one who considers their ""pet"", family. So I ask graciously for any assistance that can be given. You would not only be helping to save Chase's life, but you'd be helping to put our family back together again. I thank you in advance,Chase's family.

Grace the Chihuahua's Health Issues,"$3,500 ","$6,500 ",Animals," September 23, 2016",65,2,CAMP HILL,PA,282000,,2,"

CAMP HILL, PA                                





                        Grace is a 9 year old female chihuahua and everyone who knows me knows that her and my other 3 chihuahuas are my children. Recently Grace was having what looked like sever anxiety and panic attacks due to pain. She would tense her neck up and scream if you touched her neck. After a recommendation to a neurologist we took her down to Maryland and got an MRI. The MRI cost $4,500 but was necessary to see exactly what and where Grace's issues are. Grace was diagnosed with Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) which can often be found in small dogs like the chihuahua. IVDD is a condition where the cushioning discs between the vertebrae of the spinal column either bulge or burst (herniate) into the spinal cord space. In Grace's case, 3 of her discs ruptured, the C34, C45, and C56. Some dogs have it further down their back and end up losing the ability to use their hind legs. Luckily, Grace's is up higher and is treatable. I am still in the process of researching my options. My heart is breaking that money is even an issue for me. If surgery ends up being the best option, it will cost $11,000. If I can even come up with half of that I would be over the moon. Right now I am completely heartbroken that money is even an issue and that it could potentially prevent me from helping Grace. If Grace gets surgery she can live a normal life without pain. Until then, she will be on some pain management medicine. I will be looking into as many options as possible but know that all of them will cost money. My whole world has been turned upside down. With 4 chihuahuas I knew there would be expenses but unfortunately, I thought I had a little bit more time before anything this drastic and expensive would need to be addressed. For those of you that don't know me, my other chihuahua Rocky is 12 years old and has Mitral Valve Disease with his heart. But thanks to catching it early and seeing good doctors, we have it very much under control. Currently that was where a lot of my extra money went. Please consider donating to Grace and I or atleast sharing with others.

                        On Friday night I found a mass on Callie's right side. I took her to the vet first thing Saturday morning where we did xrays. The xrays revealed a very large mass in her abdomen. After several doctor visits, xrays, ultra sounds, and an echocardiogram( she also has heart disease we found out on this visit) she is now at the specialty center for the very tricky surgery to try and remove the spleen and giant mass. This comes with ICU overnight care and a very large bill ($6,000) As most people know I live by myself with a mortgage, car, bills, etc. all on one income which is tight to begin with. I am not one to ask for help or handouts but Callie is my whole world and I need to try and save her. I have committed to doing so already without knowing how I am going to pay for this. Any small amount will help. I appreciate whatever you can do, even if it means you just share this on your page in hopes anyone you know may be able to lend a little. Thank you

Hi! I am in desperate need of help! If you know me, you know I am normally not the one to ask for help, but I love my baby more than I love myself. Chuck, my gorgeous Bengal boy has a medical emergency that needs immediate attention! He has a condition in which his urethra gets crystals and it blocks him from being able to use the bathroom and if he is not able to do so for even a day or so, his kidneys will start to shut down, his bladder can explode and he will die a slow and excruciating death.. I would sell my soul before I let that happen. We went to the emergency vet and they were able to unblock him for the night, thankfully! If not, she said they would have to put him to sleep... But I was unable to get the money for extra nights that are required, the crystals will form again tomorrow and the cruel vicious cycle will begin again. The cost of his medical bills cover his hospital stay, anesthesia, catheters, IVs, pain meds and tests. Please please I am begging you to spare anything or even share! I don't know what I would do without him. He is my world..

Rainy's cancer treatment fund,"$3,728 ","$6,000 ",Animals," September 12, 2016",101,12,LOS ANGELES,CA,190000,,2,"

Rainy is a pit bull who was rescued years ago by Animal Advocates Alliance. She spent a long time with no home until AAA and Vice Cooler happened to find each other. Rainy was initially a foster dog but then became an officially adopted daughter and permanent pack member at the Cooler household. Together, Vice and Rainy have gone on video shoots, recording and editing sessions, and many other work/art related engagements. Through her interactions with so many of Vices family and friends, Rainy went from having no home to having a very large pack who loves her very much! Recently Rainy was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a very aggressive bone cancer. This disease deteriorates bones and can spread to the lungs with devastating consequences. In order to stall the cancer from spreading, remove her painful tumor, and give Rainy a chance at a longer life, Vice has been working with a specialist, Dr. Turner, at The Veterinary Cancer Group. She is very experienced with this type of cancer and together they have set up a plan to try and turn Rainys luck around through the very difficult decision of amputation (to get rid of the tumor which had eaten her away at her shoulder blade and caused her an unbelievable amount of pain) followed by a non-invasive series of chemotherapy treatments. The chemo will hopefully keep any microscopic cancer cells at bay for at least a year, and with some luck even longer! Since the news broke we have been overwhelmed by the kindness and love that everyone has showed in reaching out and asking how they can help Rainy. I decided to set up this GoFundMe for anyone who would like to contribute to Rainys well-being. As at this point, we have maxed out two care credit cards and depleted my student loans. To make matters worse, Vice and Rainy got evicted (for condos) and will be losing their home, workspace and all yard access at the end of October.The plan developed with the Veterinary Cancer Center totals over $15000.00. Is it worth it? Yes, most definitely. We would love to give her as much time on this planet as she can get. Not only does Rainy give love and joy to everyone she meets, she is Vices best friend/daughter/emotional therapy dog. Vice suffers privately from severe clinical depression and anxiety, and Rainy has helped him tremendously regarding this. Anyone who is friends with Vice and/or has worked on music/videos with him can attest to his kindness and helpfulness. We tried to make this work without doing a GoFundMe campaign, because we know that everyone has their own financial struggles. At this point, though, we really need help. Anything, no matter how small, you can contribute will help to put a smile on Rainys face and help her to continue a life she loves so much. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and Rainy thanks you, too!

                        Hello! My name is Sam, or Samantha. Ever since I was a little girl, I begged, and begged my parents for a dog. They made a deal with me, that once we moved I would get a dog. My grandpanrents had gotten two German Shepard puppies, and I grew up with them, but saw them only rarely because they lived over 3 hours away. One of them, Rocky recently passed away, he was my absolute world. I've been so devestated ever since. My 16th birthday rolled around, and my parents surprised me with an eight week old labadour puppy. She is currently about 18 months, and she has developedcataracts in one eye. Its gotten so bad that she can barely see out of it. We recently took her to the vet to do some tests and we also found out it is now in both eyes. Keep in mind she is still only 18 months. She can barely see out of her right eye, but the good thing is her left eye is still doing alright and wont go comepletly out until she is very much older (hopefully). The procedure for one eye is about $4000+ dollars. With the surgeries my dad and mom have been going through, have been costing so much money, we sadly cannot afford this surgery. If you could help out, that would be absolutely fantastic, every penny counts. Thank you for your time in reading this, and or even donating. Please help me reach my goal for my puppy.

Bright Futures Farm is a 501(C)(3) charity that is in it's 16th year of helping horses in need. We are accredited by the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance and work primarily with ex-racehorses. This week, we were moved to help a group of horses barely hanging on to life.I wrote a press release yesterday with optimism in my heart. The first paragraph read, Eleven starving horses that have been living an abominable existence for far too long will finally see the light of day again, today, May 3, 2016. They have been locked inside a dark, dank barn and neglected for so long that their hooves were over a foot long and curling like elves shoes. Their skin is dry, their feet are rotting, many of them are emaciated, and five of them have been hanging in makeshift slings from the rafters, their feet barely touching the ground. Four more were found locked in stalls with no hay or water.As of 11:00 yesterdaymorning I had to rewrite it. My heart sank and I cried. The first paragraph of our press release now reads:Six starving horses that have been living an abominable existence for far too long will finally see the light of day again, today, May 3, 2016. With heavy heart I grievously report that five were so severely neglected that there was no hope of saving them. This is the hardest part of what we do. Eleven horses lived in squalor for at least three years, admitted their previous owner. Today we found poor quality hay just two feet out of reach of some of them. They had no water. Knowing what time we were coming today, this man made no attempt to put any hay or water in the stalls - not even for show.Just a few days ago, I received a call from the Clarion County Sheriff's office asking for assistance. Already responsible for the care of 25 horses, and knowing the cost to vet, and rehab this many horses would quickly become thousands of dollars - and not knowing where the extra money would come from - I never hesitated to help. When you hear any living creature can be forced to exist under these circumstances, how can you say no?After coming to terms with my anger over the five that didnt survive, I realized that there is still an inspiring story of courage that has a lesson for all of us - dont give up! These horses have been at their lowest point for years and they survived. The Palomino stallion - the only survivor that was suspended from the rafters in a sling made from rubber, chain and rope - survived solely because of his spirit.Bringing these horses back from severe neglect is a daunting undertaking. They will need more frequent hoof care to carefully shorten and shape their hooves so that they can walk comfortably again. They all will need dental care, wound care for the bedsores on their hips, and skin care as they all have dermatitis due to poor nutrition. The three stallions will need to be gelded and we will need to secure more hay very soon to get them back on the road to good weight.I knew this was going to be a tough day. I didnt know how emotionally challenging it would be until I walked inside the barn, and then had the repugnant job of taking photographs of the five dead horses to provide evidence of the neglect they all endured.Our farrier will be here for the first of many visits tomorrow. Our vet will be out later in the week to do fecal exams, dental exams and advise us if we need radiographs of any or all of the horses feet since they have been neglected for so long.We need your support to provide these horses what they need over the next few months to regain their health. Please give what you can to help them recover and have the kind of life all eleven of them deserved, but only six of them can have.

                        Our Children NEED and DESERVE SAFE, CLEAN DRINKING WATER!!Bottles for The Babies is a grassroots organization created by native Flintstone, Lanice Lawson. With nearly 15 years of experience in the nursing field as an RN, she knows all too well the devastating effects of lead in the body, especially in children under the age of six. This initiative was initially created to supply the children of Flint with clean drinking water as a result of the contamination. The water in the Flint community schools has been completely shut off. Meaning, the children do not have access to clean drinking water unless they supply it themselves, and this is where we come in. With the need for clean water being so great across the city, efforts were extended to include consistent home deliveries to the elderly and physically handicapped. The lead contamination in Flint's water has resulted in the poisoning of tens of thousands of innocent people in this community. This is disheartening. It has the people feeling not only frustrated and angry, but helpless and vulnerable. Every human being deserves clean drinking water. This is not a want or luxury. This is a NECESSITY! Since the government is Incompetent of providing this basic human right, the citizens of this country MUST pull together for the sake of humanity, and provide them with the clean drinking water they so desperately need.

                        Many of you know my story. Many of you have brought me helpless, homeless and injured animals. Many of you tag me on Facebook when there is an animal in need. The word is out there that I am one of the few people who know how to care for newborn kittens, birds, goats and even puppies.  My goal here on kauai has been to help every animal that I possibly can sometimes even saving their lives. Many of you have donated funds or even showed up at my home top drop off donations and have met my many animals in my care. All who come here don't know how I even do it plus take care of my family of 7. If God wasn't involved it wouldn't be possible. I know my calling now and I will do my absolute best of my ability both financially and physically to care for these animals. The animals and I count on every single one of you for your support in prayers, funds, and donations of animal supplies. I have come this far with all of your help and will continue to do what I can for these poor helpless Animals. Please share this link and share your story on my gofund page if I helped you in anyway so everyone can follow along by reading the wonderful stories of animals that were saved. 
1. I am an animal lover that has made it my goal to help as many animals on kauai that I physically and financially can2. I was born and raised here on kauai3. I myself am the creator of my animal rescue4. Funds will be used for catfood, dogfood, litter, spay and neutering, vet bills and many more animal supplies5.

Dallas Mastectomy Surgery,"$7,245 ","$10,000 ",Animals," September 6, 2016",112,18,DALLAS,TX,351000,1,4,"






                            Art Ortiz
                            
                            
                                                           
DALLAS, TX                                




We normally prefer to offer help, not ask for it but at this point we have to. We have been hit pretty hard this year as three of our dogs have been diagnosed with cancer. It all started in March when Bruce, our greyhound, had a very rare form of skin cancer. We tried medication, chemo, everything but the tumors were too aggressive, so we had to put him down. Then, a couple of months after that, Hiro, our little rat terrier, had a mast cell tumor on his side. The vet was able to remove it and Hiro is fine now but we still have to keep an eye on him since it could always come back.


After Bruce had passed away, we wanted to add another big dog to our pack and saw that Dallas Pets Alive had a female doberman on their list. We met with her and her foster and she was just an amazing, sweet and calm girl, as docile as can be. She was already 7 years old and we decided that we wanted to give her a great rest of her life and adopted her. This was in June. Her name is Dallas. A couple of weeks ago, we took her to the vet to get her little nub tail checked out because she kept licking it. Luckily, there was nothing major going on with her tail; however, when the vet started checking out her body, she found tumors along her mammary glands that really worried her. We scheduled an appointment with a specialist and they said that they would have to remove the whole left side of her mammary glands, which will be a 14"" incision. It will be a big procedure and also very costly. At this point, after everything else that happened this year, we are not in the position to pay for her surgery which she so desperately needs. We only want the best for Dallas and if the tumors can be removed, and the vet can determine what kind of cancer it is, she might have a really good chance to recover. We just cannot do it alone. Originally, this fundraiser was going to help fund the artificial turf in our back yard. Our back yard is a place where we help dogs socialize. If youve been following our work on Instagram and facebook, youd see how weve helped so many dogs be able to socialize again, whether its been dogs who are fearful, aggressive or feral. Our home also has up to 4 foster dogs at a time, including our own 6 dogs. During the winter, the grass was destroyed with the amount of dogs weve taken in and helped. We needed to find a solution for our dirt pit that our backyard has become. Weve decided it was important for us to turf our yard to cut down on water bills, maintenance and sanitation for the dogs. When we receive rain, it takes us hours to clean off the paws of each dog that is staying with us. We wanted to be able to somehow fund both our dogs medical bills and the turf. We welcome all donations in any amount, but for every $100 you donate you will receive a DogFit Dallas T-shirt in the color and size of your choice shipped to you. Once youve donated $100, please email us the size and color you'd like. See examples below. We will ship out all the shirts the last week of September, or earlier if we reach the target amount sooner. The shirts are made of a cotton poly blend which makes them soft and true to size. The actual print will have the DogFit logo on the front which is also very soft. It's the same shirt we walk and train our dogs in.The money raised will go to fund Dallas surgery and post recovery cost. The remaining amount will go towards the turf till weve reached the goal. If any additional amount above the $10,000 is raised, it will go towards a donation to a Dallas rescue that we work with. Thank you from our entire family, Art, Anne, Emma, Hiro, Frankie, Luna, Nala & Dallas

BLACK LICK, PA                                





                        Bubbles is in Pittsburgh in critical condition. She was startled by a garbage can that got knocked over on her way outside and ran into the front door. She became instantly paralyzed. She had an MRI that showed she has Wobblers Syndrome. She suffered acute spinal stenosis and the syndrome doesn't allow room for injury cushion. They will be placing her on a steroid to help with inflammation and if she responds well to the medication, they will consider proceeding with surgery. The surgery is intense - 7.5 hours long and risky. She is otherwise healthy and strong. The doctor says that there is a chance for full recovery, but is still considered critical.Sarah and Ray got Bubbles as a puppy 2 years ago. For 4 years, she had her name picked out and asked for money every holiday to go toward getting her. Sarah was in the biggest depression of her life before she met her. Bubbles turned their (then) rocky marriage into a family. She is truly their gift from God, precious present, and first child. Sarah doesn't know what she would do without her.Anyone that has a pet knows that vet bills are INCREDIBLY expensive and the total bill is a mystery right now. Sarah and Ray are expecting another member to their family - a baby girl. Babies are expensive, too! Bubbles would love more than anything to be a big sister.If you know Bubbles, or if you know Sarah and Ray, you know that they are amazing and are the perfect family.Please help them in any way that you can. This is surely the hardest thing they have had to deal with.

                        Hi everyone! Stella is a 6 month happy little yorkie that loves to play and jump around... One night she fell yelping and didn't want to move... I took her to the vet and he told me that she broke her elbow and had to have surgery... I tried to find a way if there was any way to fix it without surgery, no luck! I decided to go ahead and worry about the money later, Stella was more important...24 hrs later (the longest of my life) Stella came out of the hospital and was home for a long recovery time.A week later she started limping on her other leg... went back to the vet and the bad news came, the other elbow was broke as well, not as bad but still needed surgery....Here i am again faced with the decision to do what's best for her.But now have no idea how I'm going to cover this... A friend told me about this and here I am asking you all to help my little fur baby get back on her feet!Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

*** Jake Full Story***Jake was born on March 6, 2006 and 10 Years Old. He is neutered and current on all vaccinations. Unfortunately, Jake does suffer from Cushings and Diabetes and has to have daily medicine for the rest of his life. Due to the Diabetes and Cushings, Jake also has Cataracts in both eyes, which has made him blind.Jake was relinquished by his owners on Sunday, January 24, 2016. His owners dropped him off at the Peoria Area Emergency Vet Clinic and instructed to have him put to sleep because they no longer wanted to ""deal"" with Jake. Fortunately, I was contacted by my regular vet (who was on call at the Clinic) and asked if I would be willing to help Jake find a new home and prevent his life from ending. She recognized Jake because he was a normal patient at Associated Vet Clinic in Washington, Illinois (which is also my normal vet clinic).With the help of Facebook, Friends and Contacts - Jake is in his new Forever Home with Rebecca & Matt Marchand. Becky is a nurse and the thought of giving shots to the Jake was not a big deal at all. Becky and Matt have worked very hard and have successfully gotten Jake regulated on his Cushings Medicine and his Insulin for his Diabetes (which was NOT regulated at ALL previously). Becky also has gotten Jake to take his eye drops like a champ. He doesn't fight them at all! Jake has received all of the pre-op checks and is scheduled for Cataract Removal Surgery at the University of Illinois on May 24th.Very strange - but Jake was supposed to lose his life on January 24th but instead - 4 months later (May 24th) he will be Healthy, Regulated, In a Loving Family ... and will be able to see again!If you would rather donate directly to his new vet - please contact:Kewanee Vet ClinicJake Marchand(309) 852-2252Thank you for all of your help, sharing, thoughts and prayers! Jake deserves to have a great home with a family that will not give up on him or turn him away whenhe needs them the most! Thank you Becky and Matt! You are true angels!

                        Hello my name is James Camacho and I am the owner of Troublez. We brought our dog Troublez to Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic last night because he had been hit by my neighbors friends car at around 5:30pm - 6pm in the city of Ontario on Sept. 19, 2016. The individual had hit 2 dogs at the same time and drove off. Only our dog suffered injuries, while the other dog was left without a scratch. There was over 10 witnesses at the scene Stephanie Castro, Albert Vazquez, Adrian Lopez Camacho, and more. We were frightened and thought our dog was dying so we took him to the treatment center immediately. When we entered through the reception doors, all I asked the receptionist, was for the doctor to STITCH HIM UP, NO ANESTHESIA, and NOTHING ELSE that was UNNECESSARY. We patiently waited for over 3 hours in the exam room, waiting to see TROUBLEZ. I had stood by the waiting room door and all I heard were dogs in the back room with a door that stated (personal staff only). I could hear EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL in pain, including the unique sound and cry of my poor Troublez, he was not crying or screaming the whole time until I released him in their hands. I was asked to pay up front before even having ONE SIMPLE GLANCE at our poor dog. He wasn't hit hard but he has an opened gash on his face, he might need stitches or possibly go through surgery. We brought him back home that night and he was still trying to run around and being actvie. The second we paid, we waited in the lobby for approximately 15-20 min before they finally brought Troublez out, they charged me nearly 600$ FOR WHAT? OUR DOG WENT IN LOOKING EXACTLY THE SAME and CAME OUT EXACTLY THE SAME. We called the clinic back a few minutes after getting home because Troublez was still bleeding heavyly. INLAND VALLY EMERGENCY PET CLINIC had told us that they dont care about the conditions our dog was in and that they did their job. What could I do about this? We spent ALL our money on this scam. All Troublz needed was STITCHES. I still have the receipt the dotoctor came in and asked for 2000$ first, then he left for an hour and came back with a second estimate for 800$. We couldn't afford over 600$ due to financial problems. All we ask for is a simple donation, does not even have to be a dollar. Any help will do in our current financial situation. !!! PLEASE ALL DOG LOVERS !!!

Hi! I'm Dee, and this is my best friend, Dash.Dash is a nine and a half year old chihuahua/jack russell terrier mix. He is a rescue, though I honestly have to admit that he is the one that rescued me. I'm not sure how I was lucky enough to have him come into my life, but the stars aligned, and he decided I was good enough to be his person.This charming lad is very active. Which led to our current predicament. You see, Dash is a jumper. He bounces at the door, springs up and down the stairs, and flies off of furniture. One of these adventures caused him to tear his CCL (Cranial Crucial Ligament). The vet said it is similar to a human tearing their ACL. Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCL) is the tearing of an important ligament in the stifle joint (knee), resulting in partial or complete joint instability, pain, and lameness. Torn ligaments retract, do not heal, and cannot be repaired completely. If the injury is not treated, damage to connective tissues and degenerative joint disease often results. So it is imperative that we address this issue for him as soon as possible, as he is putting pressure on the opposite leg to compensate and is at risk for damaging that leg as well.The surgery itself costs around $2000-$2800. The $3500 amount would help to cover the cost of the surgery as well as travel and follow up physical therapy. Recovery time is around three months and there are a substantial amount of visits to rehabilitate the leg and make sure that everything is healing properly. There will also have to be some adjustments made to Dash's surroundings to ensure his safety and keep him from reinjuring the leg.Since the other leg is at risk, time is of the essence. I imagine any of you that may be parents would feel the same way if your child were injured and there were nothing that you could do to help them. The account will be open for 10 days. I am hoping to have the surgery done by then, however.  Details to follow after the initial consult with the surgeon. Dash is the most important thing to me in the entire world. Without him, I would be lost. When he hopped in my car that day at the rescue facility, it was like we were made for each other. He is the best part of my day, and seemingly one of the only things that relieves my anxiety and helps me funtion and live normally from day to day. We have a routine and this helps with my depression and helps me to focus on what I need to get done from day to day. Seeing him immobile is like watching a little part of his happiness die, and mine with it. Let's fix him up and get him back to his charming self. In addition, I am starting a little line to help push donations and to build a little excitement for Dash's cause. Besides, he said he wanted to help. I figured the best way to do it was by flashing his pearly smile across as many things as I could. It will be called Dee is for Dash (#D4Dash). Images will be available soon on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Best friends have to stick together. And since he saved me, I need to return the favor now. Please help me with this goal and get something rad as a thank you gift. Dash needs to get back up on that leg. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the Handicapped Pets Foundation ( http://hpets.org/) which supplies wheelchairs to elderly and disabled pets that would not otherwise be able to afford them. SAVE THE BEASTS!!!!!!!!!!!

Tina P. and her husband, David, were driving home through the country one day, when Tina spotted black ears sticking up out of a ditch. Tina apologized to David for what she was about to do as she made a U-turn to investigate. In the ditch they found a small, starving, sad-eyed doggie - they named her Lilly and brought her home, where they fed and nursed her back to health. Having a full family of four dogs already, Tina and David's mission now was to find a loving, forever home for Lilly.Tina contacted her friends at Mutts-n-Stuff , a St. Louis, MO canine rescue organization, for help. Though Lilly appears to be an Australian kelpie dog and not the organization's target breed, the pit bull, Mutts-n-Stuff wanted to help Tina navigate the adoption process and select a loving forever home. As Mutts-n-Stuff worked with Tina to schedule spaying and vetting for Lilly, her adoption profile was added to the organization's website.Kristin A. had recently decided to add her first dog to the family, and she knew she wanted to adopt from a shelter or rescue. She had been scouring the Internet for weeks looking for the perfect pup. One evening, she decided to check one last time before bed to see if any new doggies had been put up for adoption, and Lilly's face popped up - her profile had just been added. She contacted Mutts-n-Stuff right away to set up a meeting with Tina and Lilly.Kristin met Lilly, and it was love at first sight - it seemed like it would be happily ever after too. But then, it was discovered during the adoption process that Lilly has hip dysplasia , a malformation of the hip joint that leads to increasing pain, degeneration, and loss of function as a dog ages. Though hip dysplasia is often associated with German shepherds, it can occur in any breed, sometimes showing signs at a very young age - Lilly is estimated to be between 1 and 3 years old, and she has already started showing signs of hip dysplasia, such as holding her leg up while walking, standing with her paw misaligned, and overall decreased activity. The malformation was confirmed by X-ray - Lilly's hip bone is not in socket, and a femoral head ostectomy is necessary at a cost of $2,500. The surgery will give Lilly a full, active life.Normal X-Ray (Above)Lilly's X-Ray (Above)Mutts-n-Stuff is now working with Tina and Kristin to raise funds for Lilly's surgery and physical therapy. After the adoption, any funds raised beyond our goal will continue to be managed by the rescue organization and will be available for hip health maintenance for Lilly's lifetime, which will hopefully be long and pain-free with your help! Please consider donating to Lilly's fund - any amount you have to give will be greatly appreciated and will go a long way toward helping this sweet little pooch get back on all fours!Thank you for stopping by, and please share this with friends and dog-lovers everywhere. Together, we can make a difference!

                        For all of us that know my friend Marissa, her pups are her kids. She revolves her life around them.  When her and T decided to get a companion for their lab Dax, they were beyond excited to find Knox. They have been looking forward to have two kids now for months and it crushes our hearts to find out about Knox and his condition!Here's their story: Knox is a 10 week old chocolate Labrador retrieverAt 6 weeks old, a slight heart murmur was detected. At 9 weeks that slight heart murmur turned into a very severe heart murmur. A heart murmur is a sound caused by some defect in the heart. After having an echocardiogram done last week, we learned that the heart murmur was being caused by a congenital heart defect called Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).PDA: The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel which connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery. In the fetus this blood vessel is normally present and functions to divert blood around the lungs which are not yet functioning. Shortly after birth this vessel will normally close; when it does not patent ductus arteriosus is the result. PDA is one of the most common cardiac birth defects seen in dogs. Females are more likely to be affected than males. Normally the blood flows from the right side of the heart to the lungs, then into the left side of the heart and out to the rest of the body. In PDA some of the blood which is leaving the left side of the heart is channeled back into the lungs. Because of this the heart must work harder to make sure enough blood is getting to the rest of the body. If this condition goes with out treatment premature death is likely.Echocardogram: $505Invasive technique open Heart Surgery: $3,200-3,800Non-Invasive Correction: $4,500  4,800This is the only congenital heart defect found in dogs that can be corrected with surgery with 100% success and normal life expectancy.We have already put $8,000 towards our first lab Dax, when he was struck by a car and broke both back legs at 6 months old.If the PDA is not corrected in the next 4 -5 months, his heart will develop volume overload creating congestive heart failure. In the event that this happens, the defect is now untreatable and the likelihood of knox living much longer is slim.

SAN CARLOS, CA                                





                                                I met Jax 3 years ago in 2012 through my beautiful friend, Melanie Middleton, who introduced me to the Jaxand wonderful world of Shih-Tzus. I'd always been hesitant of whether or not I liked ""toy dogs"" and upon first glace I thought he waspointless - a dog who couldn't protect his human for the life of him and had a face that only a mother could love.Fast forward to 2015 - Melanie travelled a lot and I had the chance to offer my hand in dog-sitting Jax for weeks at a time, and spent 24/7 with him because I could bring well-behaved pups to work. He changed my mind - completely. He melted my heart, brought so much joy and happiness to my life, offered me companionship, made me feel important and needed, loved me, greeted me, talked to me, made me exercise, listened to me, watched me cry at times, brought me closer to my family and friends - without anycomplaints at all. No doubt he brought so much light into Melanie's life as well! I wondered who was doing who a favor - me, the temporary caretaker of this little muppet baby? Or him, the bright shining ball of sunshine I got to wake up next to, the one who put the pep in my step, the furball who helped me start conversations with strangers.I think I know now, that it was Jax that was doing me, and everyone around him a favor by being Jax - the well behaved, polite, respectful, 7 year old Shih-tzu that didn't fail to make even the coldest man crack a smile.I found out today that Jax just got paralyzed from his waist down. He was traveling with his mom to Atlanta todayand began to suffer from aINTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISEASE. He can't move, is terrified, panting, crying, and soiling himself. He's in a lot of pain and we, as his human friends, have to help him out.Jax's vets quoted $7000 for a surgery and MRI that will give him an over 50/50 chance of walking again. But we need to get him the money soon.If you love Jax, or Melanie, or me, or Shih-tzus, dogs, animals, happiness, sunshine and believe in hope, love, faith,human kindness, please donate to Jax's medical fund. His wellbeing matters so much to us and the positivity he brings us spread to other humans around us.Fast Math:$7000/$140 = 50 donations$7000/$100 = 70donations$7000/$70 = 100 donations$7000/$50 = 140 donationsPlease help Jax walk again. He deserves a better quality of lifethan the one he is facing right now if we don't do anything. And, his 8th birthday is coming up on October 24th!!

                        On Tuesday August 11th, 2015 our beloved lab mix, Diamond, was diagnosed with nasal cancer.The oncologist has given her only approximately 4 months to live if her cancer is left untreated. However, because sheis otherwise healthy, Dr. Kane says she is a good candidate for radiation therapy which could giveher several more years of quality life. Unfortunately, the radiation treatments come with a hefty pricetag which is beyond our current resources, so it is with high hopes that we have set up this page torally support to be able to keep our girl for several more happy years.With your help, she can undergo the necessary medical imaging, followed by 19 consecutive days of radiation at Blue Pearl. We will post updates on her progressas she goes along.All donations above and beyond the cost of Diamond's cancer treatment will be donated to the SPCA or local animal shelter.Thank you for your support.

Help Us Save Brewsers Leg,"$1,925 ","$3,000 ",Animals," December 28, 2015",53,9,SPRING HILL,FL,116000,3,6,"

                                                            on behalf of Sherry Myers

SPRING HILL, FL                                




My name is Joanne Schoch and I am the retired executive director of the Humane Society of the Nature Coast. I am asking for your help in saving the leg of an amazing dog named Brewser. He is being fostered by a family who has supported homeless animals all the years I have known them. Brewser was found on December 10th in front of their house with his leg broken and just hanging from his body. They contacted family members and the owners of Marker 48, who are avid animal advocates to find a local veterinarian. They rushed him to the vets office immediately where Brewser was fit with a temporary splint.  Animal Services was contacted right away and they let the family foster Brewser under their jurisdiction so they could get him the help he needed sooner rather than later.  Brewser has been posted on every animal website in an effort to find his family, but no one has come forward. This is shocking as he is an absolutely exceptional dog. Dr. Kerns office, Advanced Pet Care followed up by putting a fiberglass cast on him, taking xrays (it is pretty bad) and said that the necessary surgery would be between $2200 and $2700 dollars. That is in addition to the funds already spent on the emergency veterinary visits, totalling $942.64. These costs have generously been paid by the foster family, but this is definitely not something that is within their budget. Like so many of the people I know, their heart is bigger than their bank account.  Brewser is scheduled for surgery Tuesday, December 29th. He is one of the nicest, kindest, sweetest dogs I have ever met. He deserves to be taken care of properly. He is pure love. This is a direct quote from the foster mom, ""No matter what (even if I have to 2nd mortgage my home) we will take care of this innocent baby who cannot speak for himself. If you ever get a chance to meet him you would know what I mean!!!""PLEASE consider helping us with Brewsers medical costs. I would hate to see one family with a HUGE heart go into debt to help this sweet dog. These funds are needed as soon as possible as the surgery is tomorrow.

                        Anyone who has ever shopped at Earth Pets of Gainesville knows that it's much more than a retail store. The cats and kittens that greet our customers each day are there because we have made our store a temporary safe haven for homeless animals while they wait to be adopted into new loving homes. Since 2009, Earth Pets has rescued and found homes for over 1,000 orphaned kittens and special needs cats. That is a lot of lives saved! But as long as there are still cats and kittens in our community needing rescue, we are committed to doing even more and you can help!To increase the number of lives we can save, we are building an Orphan Kitten Adoption Nursery inside our store. This is a special cage-free room where young, adoptable kittens can grow, heal, play and live while waiting for the day they are finally adopted into a loving home. The nursery will be open to visitors so they can socialize with the kittens and so that potential adopters can interact with them and hopefully choose one to adopt. The nursery is already under way but we need an additional $1,500 to pay for building material, contract labor and veterinary supplies. Our goal is to have the nursery ready by mid-March; in time for the springtime influx of homeless cats and kittens in our community and at our local county shelter.Any amount you can give will go a long way in helping us achieve this goal. Your money will be used to create a safe haven for rescued animals and will ultimately help us save more lives for many years to come.To make donating more fun, claim your kitten naming rights! Anyone who makes a donation of $25 or more can pick a name for a kitten. Just add a note on the donation page with the name you like for a boy or girl and, as we rescue kittens this year, well give a kitten the name you chose! You can make your donation here, by mail or in person at: Earth Pets of Gainesville 404 NW 10th AvenueGainesville, Fl., 32601.Thank you from all of us at Earth Pets of Gainesville and from all the cats and kittens who will benefit from your gift!100% of the donations we receive for this fundraiser will be used to build the Orphan Kitten Adoption Nursery. If we exceed our fundraising goal, we will dedicate all of the remaining donations to our veterinary fund to pay for spay/neuter surgery, vaccines and other medical expenses needed to care for the cats and kittens in our program.

Please Help Us Save Gator  ,"$1,850 ","$3,000 ",Animals," October 2, 2013",43,36,CLEVELAND,TN,549000,,14,"

CLEVELAND, TN                                




   As many of you know, our beautiful dog Gator is very sick. For the past week we have reached out to you, our friends, and asked for prayers of healing but not told or really explained why. It all began this summer when Gator began experiencing nose bleeds. We rushed him to the vet and were told this was caused by a sinus infection and given antibiotics. Over the course of the summer, the nose bleeds would come and go and were again treated with antibiotics. On a routine grooming appointment last Thursday, the groomer noticed an abnormal amount of blood and asked the vet to take a look. At that time, we scheduled to bring him in the next morning to do lab work, and  x-ray's of his skull.  The x-ray showed a mass. Although the word mass is scary, it is really quite common in dogs. They wanted to schedule  Gator to come back in so they could remove the mass and do a biopsy at that time. Monday, bright and early, we dropped our boy off and waited for the vet to call with good news. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Gators normal vet called Monday afternoon and explained that when they went in to remove the mass they found that there were at least three masses.  Because of the number, it lead them to believe these tumors were cancer and told us we would have to take Gator to The University Of Tennessee Veterinary Teaching Hospital where they specialized in cases such as these. We brought our boy home and waited for an appointment. Yesterday, Mel brought Gator to Knoxville where we were given hope about treatment but then let down when it was stated that Gators insurance would not cover any part of the surgery he would require. We are devastated that this company that we have payed to insure our pet will do nothing for him in his time of need. Gator's surgery is going to cost $3000.00. We also know if Gator does not have this surgery the masses will continue to grow and completely block his sinus cavity, at which time he will pass away. There is no option. He has to have this surgery.     Only someone who has loved a pet can understand that animals become like our children. They are there for you when you are sick, or have had a bad day, they truly become your best friend. Animals unknowingly make us pull through days when we are too tired or too sick or too weary to even want to pull through.  And Gator has been there for us during all of the above. We love this dog like a child. Losing him without fighting is not an option. We ask anyone and everyone who feels inclined to please send donations in for Gator's surgery. You aren't just saving ""a dog."" You are saving a vital, loved and cherished member of our household. He is  our guard dog, our protector, our snuggler, our sweet boy. We simply can not stand by and do nothing. We are setting this page up so donations are taken through this site. We promise you that this is NOT a scam and hope you know would NOT ask for help if it was NOT a necessity. We know everyone can not help financially but we ask you continue to keep praying and share this post.  From our family to yours, please help our Gator.""A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself.""

Help us save Harvey!,"$1,238 ","$2,800 ",Animals," May 16, 2016",32,4,MANSFIELD CENTER,CT,116000,,4,"

                        We rescued Harvey about a year and a half ago, and he's an awesome dog and part of our family. Yesterday, he ate some unknown toxin outside, and was vomiting most of the day. We thought he just had an upset stomach because his energy levels were still fine, tail wagging and everything. Around 11pm, he was taking it easy and resting.He suddenly started having seizures and we immediately rushed him to the emergency vet. We told them to do everything they could. He ended up needing a plasma transfusion, lots of bloodwork, medicine to help his liver and blood sugar, stuff to stop his seizures, and various other procedures. He was touch and go all night and they couldn't tell us if he would survive or not.This morning they called and said he had taken a turn for the better! He's responding well to meds and it seems like he has passed the most dangerous time. They don't, and won't, know what it was he got into, but we will be carefully supervising him outside from now on. The biggest likelihood was that he ate a dead animal that had been treated with poison.We are really glad that he is going to make it, but now we are left with his crazy vet bills. Normally we aren't the type of people to ask for money or handouts, but it took every penny we had (and then some) to save this boy. We know not everyone would agree with saving him if we couldn't really afford it, but we love him and ultimately couldn't put a price tag on his life.So here we are. So far his bills are at $3000 and they will increase if he doesn't get to come home tonight. He will also need expensive medication to support his liver for a period of time. Please help out if you have an animal loving bone in your body, he's a good boy and deserved more time.This vet does not do payment plans and expects payment in full when we go get him either tonight or tomorrow.

Popsicle spent over a year living on his own, surviving the cold winter in a feral cat shelter before cominginto the care ofFeline Friends Network.This boy was thin, having difficulty eating, and in obvious pain...afternumerous vet visits, prescriptions for pain medication, prescriptions for antibiotics andseveral extractions he was diagnosed witha very painful condition calledFeline Chronic Gingivostomatitis. His mouth and tongue are ulcerated making eating difficult and very painful. The only hope hehas for meaningful and lasting relief is the removal of every scrap of every root of every tooth and the longer this is delayed, the worse the prognosis. We need to raise $2640 to cover the costs of this procedure as soon as possible.POPSICLE IS COUNTING ON ALL OFUS TO HELP HIM. PLEASE DONATE TODAY! Popsicleis a sweet gentle boy who loves people. He never complains and would love to live a life pain free. He is in foster care and is hoping to find his forever home after his surgery.We will be grateful for any donation towards Popsicles surgery.Thank you in advance for your donations. http://felinefriends.ca

                        When we came to Thailand in 2010 we were not prepared for the condition of so many street dogs here. What started with one rescue from a beach in Rayong turned into eight rescues over the following year. Each of the dogs were suffering physically or had clearly been abandoned. The intention was to find them all new homes but the process took so much time and energy that they became part of our life, our routine, our family and we could not let them go. So to be certain that they would always have a good, loving and forever home we crazily decided to keep them. Now over three years later our seven wonderful soi dogs (sadly one passed away) have all been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped and all are very healthy and very happy. We are leaving Thailand in a matter of weeksand are taking our seven adopted soi (street) dogs with us. There is not a chance of leaving them behind so we hope we can raise someextra moneyneeded towards their flights and other transportation costs.Work permit and visa rules in Thailand have prevented my wife Mandy from working so all of our money comes from my teaching salary. As you can imagine paying the upkeep of seven dogs makes it hard to save for relocating seven dogs and in the past year we have made every sacrifice including no new clothes, becoming teetotal, no fast-food, no take-out and not going out. Our whole world revolves around our dream of taking our beloved dogs home.We have saved enough money to pay for all the vet bills, flight cages, paperwork,our flights, accomodation and living expenses once we land until my new salary kicks in. However the cost of transporting the dogs from our current home to our new home in at this time of year in one trip is quite high. If we aren't able to raise the money needed, it would mean splitting our family up, my wife and I living apart until we can secure the money to fly one group, then the other, resulting in simultaneousaccomodation costs. This would also make for a visa nightmare.Anysupport you can offer either with a donation or by simply passing along this message to others would be very much appreciated. If you would like to see more of the dogs please look at our blog.Thank you for being a part of our dream! David and Mandy x

Operation: Gypsy Operation,"$2,709 ","$3,500 ",Animals," September 12, 2016",76,13,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,98000,2,5,"






                            Zoe Copoulos
                            
                            
                                                           
MINNEAPOLIS, MN                                




As many of you know, my dog, Gypsy, is my moon and my stars. You've seen her grow up from a tiny pup to the bowling ball she is today here on social media, and many of you have spent time with her face-to-face, getting kisses and experiencing her insistence that she is, in fact, a lap dog.A couple weeks ago, I noticed that she was limping. And by that, I mean I noticed that she was running on three legs as she chased squirrels and ran after her ball. I took her in to the vet, and was told that she has a torn Cruciate ligament, which is the equivalent of our ACL. We can't be sure how it happened, but are assuming it's just because she is so rough-and-tumble when she plays. Gypsy needs surgery on her knee, and those of you with pets know that this is no light undertaking, financially, or otherwise.Pet insurance doesn't work the way people insurance does, and therefore does not cover anything along these lines. There are also no payment plans, and no sliding scale. The surgery she will be undergoing is called a Tibial Tuberosity Advancement. There is a wealth of information about it available online, but this excerpt from Wikipedia is a good explanation as to why such invasive measures are being taken, as opposed to physical therapy, etc. that might occur in humans:""Trauma to the equivalent ligament(ACL) in humans is common, and damage most frequently occurs during some form of sporting activity (including football, rugby and golf). The nature of the injury is very different in dogs. Rather than the ligament suddenly breaking due to excessive trauma, it usually degenerates slowly over time, rather like a fraying rope. This important difference is the primary reason why the treatment options recommended for cruciate ligament injury in dogs are so different from the treatment options recommended for humans.""During the surgery, they will change the angle at which Gypsy's knee is connected to the ligaments, therefore relieving the pressure that is being created as the bones slide against one-another. Left untreated, she will continue to limp and eventually develop arthitris, in addition to probably developing the same injury on her other leg.Post-surgery, I will have to keep Gypsy from running and jumping for 8 weeks. Those of you who know her probably understand how daunting a task that will be.This year has been full of change and heartbreak for me already, and it brings me so much sadness to see my best friend and sidekick in pain. I waited a long time to announce this publicly, and went back and forth for a long time about whether I should ask for help. But, with the encouragement of those close to us, I'm reaching out to my community for support.There is a chance there will be a benefit show featuring friends of mine & their bands for this cause, as well, but that has not been confirmed and we are down to the wire. I can see gifting admission to people who contribute to this page, but I don't know the logistics of that at this time, and just thought it was worth mentioning.Her surgery is tomorrow, and I know I should have posted this earlier, but I was researching any and all other avenues of scraping together the funds before I asked outwardly for help. I suppose better late than never?  I do not expect to raise the money before then, but rather pay back what I will have to borrow with your generosity. I cannot fully explain how difficult it is for me to ask for help, and how deeply thankful I am, even in advance, for the fact that Gypsy and I have so many people who care about us. This puppy has held me together through major career changes, three moves, breakups, and the loss of my mother last fall. I just want to do everything I can to give her the life she deserves, pain-free and happy, but this time, I can't do it alone. Anything will help, and will be treasured as an amazing gift from people who love us.Again, thank you so much, From the bottom of our gypsy hearts.***Please share this wherever you see fit. I have never done this before, and have no concept of how to effectively alert people of its existence***

This is Lewis and he is a 10 month old hound mix who was adopted by a loving couple, my dear friends Jen Schmutz & Joe Kropp. Unknowingly to all involved,a bone disease hascovertlybeen damaging his leg joints to the extent of needing joint replacement surgery.He needs to begin having surgeries in the next few days/weeks to replace his knees and hips so that he can walk and have a normal, happy doggie life.The orthopedic veterinarian estimated the surgeries to cost approximately $15,000. I've attached the estimates below.This puppy is the sweetest puppy and he only wants to make everyone smile and be happy. He gives kisses so willingly and sweetly and just wants to cuddle all the time.Any amount you can spare, $1, $10, $100, or even $.50, is gratefully welcome and will help this pup enjoy a good life. Lewis deserves an opportunity at life...don't you agree?Please help Lewis!

These boys are my heart. My dogs have been with me for a long time. They've given me their love and comfort some terrible times. In return, I want to make sure they always have what they need. I never want to leave them behind.What's going on? We need to be ready to leave this condo ASAP. We could be displaced as early as the second week of October, but we certainly will need to move by early to mid November.We're packing now, and the dogs will be staying with my ex until the new place is ready. The thought of spending any time apart from them is tearing me up, but we'll have a realtor coming and going for the next several weekswhile packing, cleaning, and doing repairs while also working full-time. It would be too much for them to handle.  Thankfully, I was able to get the funds to put a deposit down on an affordable apartment which will possibly be available by early October. It will definitely be available no later than December 5. I will have a move-in date by the middle of next week, so stay tuned for updates.What do we need? I still need to gather enough money for thepet deposit, the first month's rent, and some moving expenses. If we can't get in the new place for October I'm also going to be in need of temporary housing for myself (I may be able to stay with friends, but I would probably need to rent a car for that time since I'll be too far from the bus line to get to and from work). THANK YOU!It means so much to me that my friends feel the same way about their pets and want to help me keep mine.These guys aren't just animals. They're my KIDS, and my responsibility. Sometimes pets get left behind in these situations, but if it's at all possible, a furry family should stay together. Your help is greatly appreciated!URGENTLY NEEDED:$450Pet Deposit$725First month's rentPOSSIBLY NEEDED:$400Short term stay or rental car

Help Save Ella's Eye Sight,"$3,121 ","$3,800 ",Animals," September 21, 2016",32,3,FAYETTEVILLE,AR,83000,,1,"

                        April 5, 2015 was one of my happiest days. It was the day I picked up my 8-week old Siberian Husky baby girl, Ella B.Many times I joke that she is my child but she really is my best friend. Ella is one of the sweetest, most entertaining dogs I have ever known. She loves to talk, chase squirrels, go on hikes, swim in creeks, and play with her many dog pals. If you have ever met her, you know how awesome she is!Recently, I received terrible news. Ellas juvenile cataracts are progressing very quickly and she will go blind in both eyes. Her vet predicted it could be as soon as 1-2 months. She needs cataract surgury asap.The ophthalmologist said once blindness occurs, he more than likely will not be able to fix it due to her lenses being too severely damaged and affecting other parts of her eyes. I can already tell the decline in her vision, as she is running into doors and being startling by odd things like long grass. As you can imagine, I am completely devastated at the thought of Ella being blind for her whole life (she's only 1.5 years old!). She doesn't have to be blind the rest of her life if she has cataract surgery asap. A surgery that cost $3,800-- an expense I was not prepared for. Since I cannot afford it or take out any more loans right now, I am turning to my friends, family, animal-lovers, etc.to help me help sweet Ella.Watching her goblind at only 1.5 years old is breaking my heart. Ella and I will be extremely grateful for donations to help save her eye sight so she can live a long, normal doggie life full of playing and squirrel chasing.Please share with your friends, family, and co-workers. Thank you in advance for being a blessing and supporting us!!Love,Ashley and Ella B

                        We found a poor kitty in our back alley who couldn't walk/could hardly use his back legs. Both appear to be broken, he is very scared.I can't imagine what pain he might be experiencing. One particular back leg looks mangled, like he was possibly attacked.Us being musicians, we are more than happy to care for him, but have VERY little in our wallets. Friends, please help us help this poor cat.I plan on using all donations at STL Veterinary Center on Grand-the most reasonably priced veterinary clinic I've found in STL.It would mean a lot to us, and this little guy, just to get him out of any pain, and back to good health.Anything helps, thank you!

He loves to play with my 2 beautiful daughters as often as he can. Lately Rocky couldn't walk normal anymore and had a limp. We went to the vet and was told Rocky hasneurological problems and needs to see a neurologist and get an MRI. The vet also told us that he will need to most likely need his left legamputated. We are asking for the money to help us pay for theprocedure. If Rocky doesn't get the help he needs he will have to be put to sleep. Rocky cries all day from the pain and the medicine he is currently on just makes him sleep all day. Please help our family stay together and please help Rocky walk again. Thank you very much in advance for any donation you can make. Every Dollar Counts and Every Dollar will be used to help Save our Rocky.

Craig/Jeannie Family Burn Recovery,"$23,440 ","$50,000 ",Animals," September 2, 2016",309,22,WASHINGTON,DC,669000,11,17,"






                            Jon W. Norris
                            
                                                            on behalf of Craig Winters

WASHINGTON, DC                                




Help Craig, Jeannie and their pets recover from a horrible RV Fire and life threatening Burns!My name is Jon Norris and I am setting up this Go Fund Me account to help my best friend and his family in their time of need. On Sunday, August 21 tragedy befell a Tucson family while on vacation. Craig Winters, Jeannie Withrow, her teenage son and the familys three dogs were driving in their RV to San Diego beaches to celebrate Jeannie's birthday. While driving on the interstate coming into San Diego, flames burst out of the side of the RV. Pulling quickly to the shoulder of the road Craig and Jeannie made sure that her son and one of the pet dogs were safely out of the RV. While Craig and Jeannie were trying to evacuate, each holding a dog, the RV propane tank burst right next to them, engulfing them in flames. The sudden and violent flames burned Craig over 30% of his body. Jeannie was burned far more severely on over 60% of her body and face. Both were in shock as they waited over 40 minutes for transport. The first responders to the scene were Border Patrol agents, who happened to see the flames and smoke from the other side of the highway. They were taken to a hospital in San Diego that has a nationally ranked burn unit. The dogs,Godiva, Izzy and Pandora, were taken to a veterinary hospital. Craig was hospitalized for more than a week but luckily does not require surgery for his injuries. Jeannie however has been in the intensive care unit of the burn section and in a medically induced coma for more than two weeks. During this time she has received two major surgeries. She is expected to be kept in a coma for at least another week or more, while more surgeries are performed. While Jeannie is strong and responding well, the severity of her burns will require hospitalization for many months. Their son is back in Tucson with family attending school.Craig had recently retired from 30 years employment at Pima Community College and was looking forward to time with his family. While he is now out of the hospital, he will be staying in San Diego for the foreseeable future to be near Jeanie during her prolonged recovery.All of the belongings they had in the family RV were lost when it was engulfed in flames. Clothing, computers, money, it was a total loss. Because Jeannie is a self-employed musician and computer programmer, the status of her health insurance and her astronomical medical bills is still to be determined. When I asked my friend Craig about his injuries, his response was,if this tragedy had to happen, then the pain he feels from his burns will help him to understand in a small way what Jeannie is going through. When I asked about the dogs, he told me that one recommendation was for them to be put down. He said that they had done nothing wrong and he felt that for their sake and Jeannie's sake he had to try and save them. He knows that when Jeanie comes out of her coma, the first thing she will ask is How is my son Justin? and after Craig explains that he is safe with family and back in school, she will want to know how are the dogs. Craig wants to be able to tell her that they are healthy and have recovered.That's the kind of guy Craig is, when suffering personal tragedy and pain, he is most concerned about what he can do for others. The veterinary bills for two of their dogs have already exceeded $20,000. As of today, Gociva is fine. Izzy is recovering well, and Pandora is still struggling.IZZYPANDORAPlease donate what you can. Even small amounts can add up and make a huge difference in this time of crisis. Thank you.

                        Anyone who knows me knows my little boy Henry. He is everything to me, he's helped me through hard times with his sweetness and cuddles. And unfortunately, now it's time to help him.I noticed he was breathing heavy and not acting his normal Henry self. I gave him more water, made sure he was eating, and anything i could think of. After about a week i decided i needed to take him to the vet.Henry is experiencing something called Cardiomyopathy. Its a heart disease that blocks his blood flow, leading to heart failure. His xrays show he is probably having bad chest pains as well. I can't live knowing he's in pain and suffering. He's my boy that i love so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is my main man and no one could ever take his place. He's only 6 years old so this comes as a total shock to my family and I.As you all know medical costs for animals are very expensive. Henry is going to need ultra sounds, more xrays, and probably surgery to get him back feeling good again. I'll give all i have to save him but i know it won't be enough. So i created this page in efforts to raise money for my sweet boy. I know a lot of you have met Henry and know how loveable he is. He's the best and i can't imagine going to sleep without him right next to me!Any little bit helps and gets Henry closer and closer to recovery. Even if you simply share this page with your family and friends. He loves you all! and so do I. <3Amanda

Starfire's Transport to Sanctuary,"$5,185 ","$7,500 ",Animals," May 12, 2016",59,4,MALIBU,CA,1000,3,2,"






                            Megan Blake
                            
                            
                                                           
MALIBU, CA                                





                        This is what we were. This is what we need to be again.Starfire and Imet27 years ago.  I've been his person and he's been my horse - for 27 years. For me, animals are healers and teachers, andStarfire has taught me about passion for life and for living. Recently we left our homewhere he lived with me for 17 years. This loss has put him in trauma. He's lost over 100 lbs. He is failing because of our circumstance. And we can remedy it. Here's our story...When we met I didn't know that he was scheduled to go to slaughter the next day because he had been labeled""dangerous."" I also didn't know that he was being physiclly abused. All I saw was a magical litle horsewho called me over to visit. There was even a peacock living in his stall. When the stable workers asked me if I wanted to ride him, my answer was immediate - ""Of course!""When they got him out of his stall, that's when I saw his skellatal frame with no hair on his hind quarters from infection.  They led him over to saddle him up and right away grabbed him by the ears, threw him to the ground and held him down by anchoring thier knees into his neck. As he flailed they shoved the bit into his mouth then let him up, bridled. As they threw a big Western saddle into the air hoping it would land on his back, panic sent him jumping and rearing, so they tied a tie-down rope from his nose band between his front legs and pulled it tight to hold his nose down to his chest. He continued to rear with his head tied down and reared over backwards and flailed on the ground - all the while the men threw the saddle up hoping it would hit the bony target.I had bonded with the little horse, had ridden all my life, and this was an Arabian.  They ""know."" They ""see"" who is who. I told the men to get away from him and give me a leg up - bareback. They did, and the little horse and I rode away.It was the most magical ride I had ever had - like riding a little carousel horse or a unicorn. He was green-broke and had no concept of what a trail was. We rode through the brush and up and down the hills in the Chatsworth mountains trotting and dancing the whole way.When we arrived back at the stables, the stable owner met me screaming ""That horse is crazy! You could have been killed!"" I was shocked. My thought was ""No... all these men here are 'crazy'. The horse is fine."" I got off. Returned the little horse to the men and left.I felt an empty type of shock. This horse was so special, so communicative, sensitive... The phone rang. It was the little horse's owner, a young woman who told me the slaughter truck was coming to get him tomorrow. She had heard I rode him; ""No one can get near him, do you want him?"" I knew that out of all the horses in the world he was meant for me and out of all the people in the world, I was meant to be his. ""Yes."" When I got the papers from her, they showedhe's a Registered Arabian with double Bask. Bask is the world's topArabian World Champion, and this little throw away horse had Bask on both sides of his blood line. That was amazing, but not important. What was was important and what mattered was the spirit of life and the lessons we were to share in the next 27 years together.Starfire and I have been together for 27 years. The last 17 years, he lived with me and his miniature horse companion in my backyard on a beautiful hill in a magical eucalyptis grove. We evacuated together during the Malibu fire storms.He wokeme up in the morning by coming to the bedroom window. But circumstances changed, we don't have the house anymore, and Starfire is being boarded at a place where he is very unhappy, nervous and in trauma from losing his home. He has lost over 100 lbs in one month. Thehorse in the pen next to him charges and bites chuncks of skinoff of his neck. Starfire has ripped his nose open and suffereda sinus infection. He paces when the other ranch horses move to a position where he can't see them, he's very tense and doesn't eat. We must move Starfire right away. He deserves to be in a supportive sanctuary for his retirement.Safe Haven Equine Rescue and Retirement wants him. They are the ""real deal"" rescuing mustangs, Premarin mares, race-track nurse-mare foals... The thrown away horses there are ""fat and happy."" It's managed by my friend, Ginny Wiltsey, islocated in NC in the same city where I will bestaying. I'm from the South. My heart is there. Starfire and his companion, Mini HaHa, and I all will go there together to be home.As for me, I'm Megan Blake. I'm an actress and have spent all of my available time working to help animals. I can't not help animals. It's in my DNA. I hosted a TV series for pets on PBS, ""Animal Attractions TV"" that won an Honorary Mention at the Humane Society of the United States Genesis Awards, and I now have a Radio show on Pet Life Radio with my spokes-dog, Super Smiley which has also won a Genesis Awards Honorary Mention. We have a Kindness Program with inner city kids, the Super Smiley Project, Teaching Kids Kindness Through Animals, and we just created a Super Smiley Kindness PSA with the University of GA.  And... Super Smiley is the K9 Ambassador of Kindness for State Farm and for The Animal Film Festival! We pay it forward. Now Starfire needs help. We urgently need help to get the money to move them. Starfire is 30 years old and has lost over 100 lbs. Arabians can easily live to be 38 so ""his time"" is not yet here. On the contrary, he and Mini HaHa can participate in our equine Kindness program and equine therapy when they are settled in NC. And, Super Smiley works as a Pet Partners Therapy Dog in NC. We all will continue to pay it forward. We need the money now for a professional, safe horse trailer, driver, barn/lodging on the cross US trip, medical checks and certificates to get Starfire and Mini HaHa to their Sanctuary in NC where they will be care-taken by people trained to help them relax and thrive. I will be there too.This means life for Starfire. It means my heart to me. He may die soon if we don't get him to the right place. He means the world to me. For me animals are healers and teachers. Starfire has taught me about passion for life and for living. Thank you for helping us. I will be eternally thankful to each of you. No donation is too small and all of you are appreciated so much.Special Incintives for larger donations:For each $250. donation, you will recieve an autoghraphed DVD of one of these films:As an actress, I starred in the Sci-Fi film, Eyeborgs, opposite Adrian Paul, ""The Highlander.""

                        This is so hard for me and my family. Our sweet baby girl is in danger.We are heartbroken!! What it began as an innocent cough has become a nightmare. Negri has always been a healthy dog, loved by our family specially my daughters. She is a playfull, full of life chihuahua mix, that love to run, jump and having fun with her sisters. Last week she was diagnosed with a tumor in her right lung and the only way to save her life is doing an emergency surgery. We are against the clock.The surgery costs 5000 dollars, plus 2000 for chemo, labs and hospitalizations,ignoring this life saving surgery is not an option!! This process has been both emotionally and financially draining, but worth every cent. All the money that we had went to the CT SCAN and other diagnoses procedures (Picture below).She still in good sprits, playful and with good appetite despite of her condition, I come to this forum with my heart in my sleeve asking for your help. Please help us save the live of our beautiful girl that have no idea what is happening and give her the opportunity to spend many years with her loving family.Help us to save her. Even $1.00 helps us!!Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Heaven-can-wait-Negris-History-184941581938659/?ref=aymt_homepage_panelI give my word that if anything comes in over what I spend for Negri, it will donated.Negri is attending Miami Veterianry SpecialistsEternally grateful.____________________________________________________________Me llamo Angeline Mundo y soy mama de dos chicas humanas y dos nias peluditas, que las amo con todo mu corazon!! La semana pasada me dieron la peor noticia que una madre puede recibir, una de mis chicas esta en peligro!Estoy aterrada! Lo que comenzo como una inocente tos tratada sin exito con antibioticos, termino en una pesadilla de la cual todavia no despierto.Negri siempre ha sido una perrita saludable, juguetona, que vive dentro de la casa con sus otras hermanas, y sobre todo muy amada por todos en la famila, especial por mis hijas.Negri fue diagnosticada con un tumor en el pulmon derecho y le pronogniscaron 2 meses de vida, si no se le practica una cirugia con urgencia para removerlo. La cirugia tiene un costo de $5,000 mas los otros gastos de medicinas, hospitalizacion, quimio y laboratorios, que los estimaron en otros $2,000. Lamentablemente para poder pronogsticarlo le tuvieron que hacer CT SCAN y otros laboratorios y ya he gastado todos mis recursos economicos. Ella esta muy feliz, comiendo normal y jugando con sus hermanas, y con muchas ganas de vivir, es por eso que recurro a este medio a pedir con mi corazon en la mano que me ayuden a salvarle la vida a esta hermosa que no tiene idea de lo que esta pasando por su pequeo cuerpecito. Ayudame a darle la oportunidad de salvarle la vida. Quien me conoce, sabe que mi pasion son los perros y que ayudo siempre que puedo economicamente, rescatando y dando en adopcion, o dando foster a otros rescatistas, he salvado muchas vidas, y jamas pense que algo asi me ocurriria a una de las mias!! Pero lamentablemente no estamso exentos de estas jugadas del destino.NINGUNA aportacion es pequea, lo que puedas aportar estare por siempre agradecida!!Gracias por leermeAngeline

                        Hello, my sister has recently rescued a 10-month old Husky from a neglectful and abusive home. This beautiful dog's name is Oakley and he is malnourished and has been suffering with a broken femur for nearly a whole month.She took him to a vet and the vet confirmed that he was neglected, badly abused and malnoursihed. He is in constant pain and the options are to either amputate the leg or try to fix it. The vet bill is going to be around $5,000. Any financial help will be much appreciated and will go towards saving his leg!He is a very loveable dog, he gets along great with my sister's daughter, my 1-year old niece. He is very well-mannered and happier now that he is in a loving environment. But, at night he is in so much pain that he just constantly cries and licks his leg. It is so upsetting to see this young dog in so much pain that my sister was up crying alongside him. He is on pain medication but it is not enough. He is waiting to see an orthopedic surgeon on Wednesday, September 28th.Hopefully, with everybodies help, we can save this beautiful dogs leg! Anything helps!

DAYTON, OH                                





                        I don't even know how to tell this story. I guess Ill start at the beginning. A few days ago our lives were turned completely upside down. Wednesday 9/21/16 our beautiful furbaby Azia woke up in the middle of the night, with a very high fever, she even vomited on our bed. We knew right away she needed a vet. We rushed her to the emergency at 2am. They ended up sending her home with antibiotics, hoping that would kill off any infection causing the fever. The next day my boyfriend Nick took off work to stay home and monitor her. Around noon he noticed she still wasnt feeling right. He took her temp and it had gotten even higher, 105.7. We rushed her to the vet.They tookAzias temperature and got areading of 106, which is very dangerous for dogs. Azia was immediately hospitalized. The family vet was able to get her temp to come down within the first 24 hours. Now on to Thursday. Over my lunch hour at work Maverick (Azias brother) and I went to visit her at the vet. Azia perked up when she saw us, but was still very lethargic. The vet was not able to talk to me at that time due to being in surgery. Maverick and I had our visit with Azia and I was instructed to call back at 2:30 pm. The call that I made at 2:30 was a game changer, life ruiner, dream crusher..The vet informed me that after multiple blood tests they have confirmed that Azia suffers from Auto Immune Hemolytic Anemia. This basically means that her white blood cells are attacking her red blood cells. They informed me that they were going to start her on an oral chemo therapy drug, but if they were not able to stabilize her over night, she would need to be taken to the emergency vet in Cincinnati. I got off the phone and with the help of many family members, started to research this disease. I talked to the vet multiple times throughout the evening. We decided that I would go in to visit Azia at noon the following day and we would discuss options. Friday morning comes around and at 9am I got a call from the vet. They stated that Azias blood levels had dropped drastically throughout the night and she is not responding to treatment. Our family vet no longer felt comfortable caring for Azia and stated that we needed to pick her up and transport her to MedVet in Cincinatti.I immediately left work (I had only made it to the parking lot) Nick and I left right away. We went to the vet and picked up Azia. By this time she was extremely lethargic and her skin, very yellow. We rushed her to MedVet. When we arrived Azia was taken back and we waited in a room, hopeful for good news. When the vet came in to talk to us he was very honest. He told us that this is a very difficult disease to treat, but they will do everything they can. All dogs respond to the treatment differently. The drugs that our family vet was using, were not working. They have plans to try new drugs in the same family (immunosuppressants). . .something a little stronger. They need to shut down her immune system to stop the white blood cells from attacking the red blood cells. Then we got another curve ball, they did another blood test. Azias blood levels are now so low that she needs a blood transfusion. They explained that with this disease, they don't know how long this transfusion will last. It is just a bandaid. They need her to have enough red blood cells to continue treatment. A blood transfusion takes between 2-5 hours andis an unknown. Some dogs with this disease can use that blood for days, some for hours, and for others.. by the time the treatment is done the white blood cells in their body have already killed off all of the new red blood cells. We are praying night and day that this will work. She can use this transfusion to give her time for the vet to figure out what treatment plan will work. Azia is a part of our family. Her 5th birthday was thursday while she was hospitalized at our family vet. I will do whatever I can to help her. We will continue treatment for as long as Azia is comfortable and not in pain. We're honestly not sure what we would do without her. We are currently running from Dayton to Cinicinatti as much as we can. The vet has assured us that our visits are very good for Azia right now. All of this being said, This treatment is very expensive. A blood transfusion alone is $920. So far, we have aquired $4000 in debt and we are only about 3 days in. I hate to ask for money, but anything will help. Thank You all for your well wishes and any donations we receive. All donations will go straight to Azias fight against Auto Immune Hemolytic Anemia. If you are not able to donate, please pray for Azia and our family. Thank you all again.

Hello. I'm Abby and this is my canine friend Sasha.Hello. I am Alisha and this is my canine friend Rory.We live on the Sunrise Side of great Northern Michigan, in the City of Alpena, which has around 6,000 dog owers. As in most cities, there are ordinances that require dogs to be on leaches when in public. But, many canines have the need to play and run free. These dogs become unruly and and may chew on shoes to let out their need to be a dog. Therefore, we have worked with the City of Alpena to build a park for dogs and their friends that does not require the the dogs to be on a leash. This park will be a safe place for dogs to play and socialize. The park will also benefit the community by allowing owners to socialize and promote responsible dog ownership.All the money raised will be used to purchase materials to make the park safe and usable for the dogs and their friends. This includes, fence, gate, water, mutt mitts and other construction needs. All extra funds will be used to make the park better for the dogs.Please support our park and as soon as we reach our goal, we can start to build the park.Thank you from all the dogs and their friends.

                        Hi, my name is Limo.I'm an 8 year old Chocolate Lab.(And from the looks of it, I'm pretty adorable, if I don't say so myself :)My story all started a little over a year ago.I was doing my regular routine - you know, wake up in the morning, drive my owner's crazy with unbridled love and affection,tear around the house in anticipation of going for a walkand eating a delicious breakfast of dried dog food and water - the usual.Suddenly my owner came running over and started petting me very gently. He seemed pretty concerned.He rolled me over on my back and started caressing this huge lump on my belly.He'd never seen it before.(I, of course, having no eyes under my belly, had never seen it either.But I LOVE being pet on my belly. Who doesn't?!))Well wouldn't you know it? Turns out I have a tumor.And not just any tumor, an ENORMOUS tumor. Like the size of a SOFTBALL tumor.Like it's got it's own ZIP CODE tumor! We're talking BIG!!Now the good news is, it's not life threatening - yet.My good friend and vet Dr. Williams - she is so cute and she LOVES me -she tells me it's benign, meaning it's not cancerous - yet.But if it continues to grow, it could prove very serious.Needless to say, I need to have it removed.The problem is, I have to pay Dr. Williams $2600!Two Thousand Six Hundred Dollars!I don't have that kind of money!I'm a dog!I don't have ANY money!!!(But I do have so much loveand affectionand happinessand loyaltyand energyand braveryand devotionand I can lick your face so hardand so fastand with so much enthusiasmit'll fall right off!! YEAH!!! Yum, yum YUM!!!!Oops...wait...sorry, I digress...)In any event, here's where you all come in.Any help you could give me by throwing a few extraGeorge's or Abe's or Alex's or even Benny's ($) my way would be a huge help!See, many of you know my owners.They're WONDERFUL people and they really love me, but...They're artists. They work in the theater. Need I say more?They never planned for something like this and they could rrrreeeaaally use your help!My surgery is scheduled for next week - that's how urgent this is.So do me a favor - help out a cute, adorable, rambunctious, utterly lovable(and totally unemployable!)Chocolate lab.You'd be adding years to my life and helping me get rid of this *%&##@* tumorthat's hanging off the bottom of my stomach like a watermelon!THANKS!(And if I could get near each and every one of you, I would lick you till you got sick of it - I swear!)BTW - Here's a pic of me with B before she's off to college.And another pic of me playing lacrosse with E.I'm cute AND athletic, right?

David & Kayla's Tornado Help,"$11,060 ","$10,000 ",US Storms," December 27, 2015",136,9,DALLAS,TX,941000,,2,"

                                                            on behalf of Kayla Scott

DALLAS, TX                                





                        If you have reached this page, it is because you have expressed an interest in helping David, Kayla & their boys any way you can, following the devastating tornado that ripped through their home on the evening of 12/26/15.The good news is that they were all together, and they emerged without any physical injuries. I don't want to gloss over that. It is a tremendous blessing that today we are discussing how we can help them, rather than how to say goodbye.However, putting their lives back together will not be easy; not physically, not emotionally, and not financially. They have lived in this home for nearly 20 years. It is the only home Will and Ben have ever known. It has not only been the center of their family life for two decades, it was also the home office for David and Kayla's individual businesses. So, going through the debris, trying to salvage both personal and professional property and records,will be a monumental task.As of this morning, (the day after the tornado), no one, including home owners, are being allowed back into the neighborhood, while emergency personnel try to account for everyone, as well as secure the neighborhood from looters. So, much is unknown about the extent of the damage, and what part, if any, of the structure or the furnishings can be salvaged. Even what wasn't damaged or destroyed by the tornado is at risk from the continuing storms.What we DO know is that they have insurance on their home and cars. Kayla's car was in the garage, and it was crushed when the garage collapsed. David and Will's vehicles both sustained damage as well. So, even though insurance will undoubtedly pay for the repairs, the deductibles alone will easily run into the thousands of dollars. There will be many unforeseen expenses, and many of them will not be covered by their insurance. I have NOT asked David & Kayla for permission to create this GoFundMe page, because I know what they would say: ""We are fine; we will be okay."" However, for all of us who want SO desperately to do something, ANYTHING, and currently feel like we to help, this at least provides an option. On behalf of David, Kayla, Will and Ben, thank you so much for your concern, your prayers and your contributions.Danny Scott

The money left over will help me to purchase food and water and also vet costs as I hope to castrate and spay all the dogs (where its possible) I rescue. This is a big thing to undertake but every day I see so many and then I look at my dogs who have a lovely home and cuddles and food and water and shelter and toys and chew sticks and and and and ...... I am not able to work here at the moment and doing all I can but would love, with your support to start The Star Temple Rescue Centre and maybe even one day to be able to find new homes for the dogs. Can you help?Funds will be used to purchase land, build a shelther with 8 dog runs and a medical hut and hopefully buy food and medical supplies.

                                                Hey everyone!My name is Lauren Cobb and I'm a veterinary assistant at the UGA Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Tuesday night, an adorable four to six-month-old neutered male black Lab puppy was brought into the Emergency Service to be euthanized after being hit by a car. Despite the amount of immense discomfort that he was experiencing upon presentation, his sweet and gentle personality shined through. We made arrangements totake him in to avoid euthanasia and to find him a loving home.He has since been diagnosed with femur and pelvic fractures.Because the fractures are on opposite sides of hisbody, his fractured femur must be repaired so he can regain normal mobility.The current plan is to surgically repair his femur fracture and to let the pelvic fracture heal on its own. The femur repair is estimated to cost $3,000 if no complications arise.Once he is on the mend following surgery, he will be available for adoption for the right family.Unfortunately, if we cannot raise the funds for his surgery in the next week, he will need to be euthanized. It would be unfair to make him continue to live in this amount of discomfort due to lack of funds to repair his leg.Since heset paw in this hospital, he has been the most patient and sweet puppy despite what he has been through. We want nothing more than to help him be comfortable so he can go back to being the rambunctious puppy he's meant to be.We cannot be more grateful for any amount of money you are able to donate to help us afford his surgery.He sends you all the sloppy puppy kisses he can muster!

Meet Ginger...She came to us badly neglected and severely abused. Both of her front legs have been broken as well as a back leg. Ginger was kept in a cage for the last 7 months because of the arrival of a new baby.There are no words to describe the emotions I have right now..I do know that she came to Pet ResQ for a reason.We as always will do everything possible to fix her and prove that not all humans are evil. She is currently at Yonkers Specialty Center. Of course she is anemic and extremely dehydrated as well..This is going to be a very long process just getting her healthy enough to undergo one surgery let alone the 3 or 4 she will need in the future. All lives matter to us and this baby will not be denied anything because of money...PLEASE consider donating to her care..Help Us Help Ginger!!!

Have you heard? Its official! Friends of Sangamon County Animal Control now includes a rescue and foster program.Friends of Sangamon County Animal Control has become a rescue. We are now able to place animals from Sangamon County Animal Control into our approved foster homes. Meet Violet and Rosie. They are the first two SCACAC dogs that Friends of SCACAC Rescue officially pulled from SCACAC. We have already had our first adoption when Violet found her forever home and little Rosie is healing well in one of our approved foster homes. As Friends Rescue becomes more involved in rescuing shelter animals we are finding that there is equipment and supplies that we will need. Our rescue wish list includes portable kennels, food, funds for medical intervention and transport costs. We are hoping that this Go Fund Me plea will help us acquire this equipment and supplies. This funding will help to purchase 2-3 portable kennels, assist with veterinarian fees and provide gas for transporting our pets to forever homes or safe shelters. We would be so grateful if you would help our rescue grow by donating to our wish list. Volunteered staffed, 100% of all money goes to the animals.

The Panhandle Animal Shelter is asking for the public's support in helping us continue to address canine distemper virus at our shelter. Tuesday, April 21 we received the news that one of our dogs had been diagnosed with this deadly and viral disease. We have since confirmed 20 puppies in our care who have contracted canine distemper. While all of these puppies have been in quarantine, we temporarily suspended and have since re-opened dog adoptions while we assess our entire population. The majority of our population is now available for adoption. All our dogs are vaccinated upon intake, therefore we are confident our adult dogs will not contract the disease.In this situation, many shelters are forced to depopulate, euthanizing either all their dogs or any dog showing signs of illness, as soon as distemper is diagnosed. Our leadership team, and our staff reject this approach as it contradicts our core philosophy and mission. Instead, we have chosen to save as many of our dogs as we can. This is an aggressive and innovative response strategy following the guidelines and instructions of the University of Wisconsin.Our commitment to the animals in our care and our responsibility to the communities we serve will continue to guide us in how we respond to this situation. The things we do for our four-legged friendsTo that end, we are monitoring and testing all of the dogs in our care and are clearing dogs for adoption after veterinarians are confident they are not only resistant to the virus, but also not spreading it. These tests are very expensive and we expect to incur thousands of dollars worth of medical bills, but the costs will not stop us from providing our dogs with top notch medical care.Of course, this comesat a high cost and we need your help.THREE WAYS YOU CAN HELP1. Make sure your dogs are current on vaccinations. The canine distemper vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines and can offer protection within hours.2. Make a donation to help pay for the continued care of these tiny fighters! 3. Donate dog toys and dog treats to help keep our canine guests happy and healthy during their stay.

Nicaragua remains listed as the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, the average salary is between $100-$200 a month. In a country where a lot of people go to bed hungry it is very difficult to generate much local sympathy for dogs and cats. In many homes there are no left over scraps for a dog. A dog is rarely considered a member of the family and is there for a practical purpose of guarding or catching vermin. While things have improved over the last 15 years or so, there are still so many stray dogs starving, sick, and abused and there are no government programs or funding at all.I have been working with Adan Foundation (Fundacion Adan)  https://www.facebook.com/FundacionADAN?fref=ts,a wonderful 501(c)3 organizationthat is growing as far as having more dogs to take care of but not much funding, no real shelter to speak of, only some kind hearted folks who have agreed to serve as foster homes. Currently there are almost 200 dogs in their care and there is no more room to take any more in. Adoptions are very few and very slow coming and many of the dogs they have are not adoptable as they have disabilities or are very old. Fundacion Adan also takes in cats and they even placed an abused horse with a loving family.

I started working with Fundacion Adan at the end of 2011, two years after my 21 year old son was murdered. I needed a reason to live and found it doing something that my son was very passionate about, rescuing animals. Since he was a little boy he had a special place in his heart for animals, especially those in need. He was always bringing home strays and always needed to be around animals. We were never without dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, snakes, and once a couple of chickens! His most notable acquisition was Damian, a beautiful pitbull. Thats a long story but suffice it to say that I learned through Damian that dogs are capable of more love than humans, he lived with us for 13 years and died of sadness exactly two months after my son died.There was so much he left undone, I got the idea that I would do something he would be proud of, something he was passionate about and thus was born my idea of one day opening a sanctuary for the many that are not adoptable so that we can have room for more dogs that are in dire need on the streets. We are running out of space in our foster homes.I was finally able to fulfill that dream and purchased a property for the foundation but we have to build a fence around the property, make some renovations to the rundown house for the volunteers that will care for the dogs, and clear some of the land to build shelter for the dogs. Unfortunately we are falling short and I am reaching out hoping that we can reach this goal with your kind help. You can also donate via PayPal at dianasanchez2@yahoo.es.If you are interested in donating materials instead to this GoFundMe account, please contact me for delivery information. Thank you!

This is one of our largest foster homes, and by large I mean number of dogs because in this small and humble home Daniel fosters 18 dogs! https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hogar-Temporal-Juan-Carlos-Sanchez-II-Fundacion-Adan/182494821934634?fref=ts

                        Twin Oaks is a non-profit that has been giving senior horses a home for over 29 years. They have 15 horses and ponies that they care for. With the constant costs of feed and supplies, they are always in need of financial help! Please help us let these seniors live out their days at the home they've all known for soo long!Our boy Tibbs ""San Jack Leo"" is the horse that ""started it all"" here at Twin Oaks Horse Sanctuary. He was the first horse that we had the opportunity to rescue. He was found starving, skin and bones, his chest torn open from desperately trying to get to the grass that was on the other side of the barbed wire that surrounded him. After his passing on August 14th, we thought about all of the horses that were saved because of Mr. Tibbs. If our count is correct, he is responsible for saving 29 horses over the last 29 years, not including himself, which is nothing to make lite of for your ""average"" Quarter Horse. It would be such an honor to him, that donations be made in his name, to keep his horse friends fed and safe so they can be afforded the same life that he had, where he never worried about a meal, or being abused and was always kept safe since the time he was rescued. It is sad, but there is always another horse in need of rescuing. We know he will be smiling down from that big green pasture over that rainbow bridge knowing that everyone cares so much about his friends! Thank you for your Support! Note: It costs us roughly $7,000.00 a month to care for the horses. Not including emergency vet bills, farrier, teeth, etc. (I.e. Tibbs vet bills total over $1,000)

                        About our Campaign:We have an opportunity to purchase a local piece of property with 40 existing kennels. It would make a perfect shelter for us. By combining our network of loving foster homes with the added benefits of having a physical shelter, we can save more lives. Weve raised a portion of the purchase price, but we need to raise more. Your donation will be helping save thousands of lives for many years to come. We are limited on time so we need you to please donate today. With your help, we know we can make this happen!  What Your Donation Means:The number of emails we get every day asking for help is staggering. They come with photos of the animals that are going to be euthanized unless a rescue agrees to take them. Because we are currently just foster based, we are limited on the number of animals we can save. We are always left wondering what happened to the ones we couldn't take. The day we have a shelter is the day well be able to say yes to so many more animals. That's what your donation means. More lives saved!About Us: One Step Closer Animal Rescue (O.S.C.A.R.)in Sparta, New Jersey, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit rescue organization that saves dogs and cats from desperate situations. We care for these animals until each and every one finds the loving home they deserve. We ensure all animals in our care receive proper veterinary care, including vaccinations, and are spayed/neutered. We are strictly an ALL volunteer group. To date, we have saved close to 4,000 lives. In January 2015, we announced a campaign to raise funds for a permanent physical NO-KILL shelter. In 2015, between fundraisers and donations, we raised $180,000. An additional $100,000 provides the funds necessary to purchase this property andbegin operating a NO-KILL shelter. With a 40 kennel facility and an area to be used as a free roaming cat room, well be able to save many more animals for years to come.

                        Bizzie is a 3 year old pound rescue that is suffering from an unknown illness.  Since early September, she has undergone two surgeries, multiple tests - including an ultrasound, and is still undiagnosed and sick. She has had to stay in the hospital for fluids and medications and her veterinarian bills continue to grow. We are currently waiting for biopsy results which will hopefully reveal the problem and determine treatment. Her ''mommy"" , Jamie, is a very hard working person and is already working to come up with the money but is afraid she won't come up with what is needed to save her best friend. Jamie's human friends and family want her to be able to decide what to do based on Bizzie's best interest, not the financial burden it might entail. So if you are able, please donate any amount you can to help pay Bizzie's vet bills. No amount is too small. Thank you for caring and sharing.

                        We adopted Harley from the Connecticut Humane Society in Newington last year. Our poor little dude was one of 21 dogs living outside in a rabbit hutch in what was deemed a hoarding/puppy mill type situation. We had no idea when we adopted him that his traumatic life  would affect him so. Harley has pica, a medical condition that causes him to compulsively eat objects, something the vets thinks is a response to having to compete with 20 other dogs for food every day for 8 years. In our first 2 months of owning him we spent approximately  $4,000 dollars. He first ingested 3 large rocks, the largest object the veterinary surgeon said he had ever removed from a dog his size and required surgery. He then ate acorns and cardboard and required an endoscopy for removal.Our little guy is back in Pieper Memorial a third time, with a bill so far of 1,000 but it's quickly climbing. Harley passed an acorn this morning while at the vet and a repeat xray showed improvement in his colon, however his stomach is not emptying which raises concern for an obstruction. We have already spent a total of 5,000 on Harley in one year. Surgery will cost a minimum of 2400 dollars and we do not know how we can continue to pay these bills. If Harley is indeed obstructed and it is not removed, he will die. We are begging all of you, if you can contribute even a little, as we know money is a struggle for everyone, it would be appreciated. We have not even paid off his original bills from his previous surgery and are continuing to accrue more! Any little bit helps, and anything left over will be donated to area rescues for their medical dogs' care.

His tail is always wagging; his crystal blue eyes the epitome of love. His energy is never ceasing.Hisphysical and mental strengthis immense but his love is even greater.   When the children are in their rooms, if he's not with them, he lays outside their door waiting for them patiently. He greets us every morning as soon aswe wake up with his Husky way of ""talking"" with gentle grunts and howls. It's like he is saying good morning to his pack. Lickson the face are customary if you let him. He always licks my nose twice without fail. He loves to be hugged and to be literally by our sides, every day of his life. When you take Calliou on a walk; he couldn't look more proud. To be on a walk with his pack is what defines him. Chest expanded, head high, trotting beautifully. His red and white coat and blue eyes turn heads. It's not uncommon to have multiple people approach and ask questions about this beautiful, loyal Siberian Husky that loves his family so much. He greets strangers with affection and will often plop down on the ground and show them his belly. Rub Cai's belly and you have a true-friend for life! Calliou has always been a STRONG dog, healthy, full of energy and ready to run at a moment's notice! When the vet would see him for his booster shots and heart worm checks, they were always amazed at how young he looked and how healthy he was. He always seemed to be half his age despite being an elder dog. I felt like Cai could be one of those dogs who would live 20 years! That's why we were shocked when last month we took Cai to Northwoods Vet to get his annual heart worm check and physical We received the scariest diagnosis anyone could get for a family member; CANCER. As Cai's vet, Dr, Jagocki at Northwoods Vet performed her annual hands-on physical exam, she stopped short and said she felt a lump in his lower belly. The look in her eyes told me it wasn't good. I felt my heart sink. She whisked Cai off to the X-ray room and our worst fears were confirmed, Cai had""Adenocarcinoma"" which is cancer of the anal gland. This is a particularly bad kind of cancer because it spreadsquickly. When Dr. Jagocki showed me the x-rays, I was in denial and had a hard time accepting what I was looking at.The tumoris large and is pushing on his intestines.Less than one month of the diagnosis, the tumor hasalready enlarged. This once mighty and beautiful dog, can no longer run,which is his passion. He limps along as the tumor is pressing against hisinternal organs and limiting movement in his hip joint.  To make matters worse the surgery is beyond my financial means which makes me feel inadequate and helpless. I am the man of the house and I cant help my best buddy, who is in the fight of his life. I can save about $250-$350 a month for the surgery and maintain my household but that will take too long. I am working extra side-jobs to make more money but to put it bluntly, Cai CAN'T afford to wait that long because the cancer is spreading and the tumor enlarging. He will be dead before I can get the money to try to save him. The vet believes the cancer has spread to his lymph nodes. Next is kidney and lungs. If that happens, it's over for Cai. There willbe no chance to savehim, it will be too late.   Please HELP US save Caillou!  The costs: The surgery to remove the tumor is $3,500.00, the after- care would cost about another $500.00. This is the costs were attempting to get help with. Chemo Therapy is about $800.00 a month but we have decided that if we can get the surgery for Cai; his best chance at survival will be through high quality nutrition and lots of love. Weve decided to forgo the chemo treatments. To help Cai's immune system, we're feeding Caiorgan and lean meat/high protein diet. He takes many supplements to help battle the cancer such as Glutamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Reishi Mushroom Extract,andFish Oil and only drinks filtered water.   Caillou is still strong, physically fit, comes from championgenesand has a strong desire to live. I know he can make it through the surgery, IF we can just get him the surgery!  Caillou is under the care of Dr. Jagocki and Northwoods Vet in North Charleston, SC.  Please help meSAVE CAILLOU!

He fetches, runs buly my side, and snuggles.Kylo jumped out of a 2 story window fracturing two paws and a hip joint. He is lucky to be alive and I'm trying to get him as much help as I can.He will need surgery for his hip and I can't afford the procedure. He is in intense pain and can barely walk and it just breaks my heart seeing him like this. The surgery should be done next week and I'm asking, begging, and searching for money.Please donate anything. Anything helps. Repost, pass this around, spread the word to help Kylo.

                        On Thursday, September 22 we took a walk on our lunch break and this sweet handsome guy came running to us from out of the woods. He was quite hungry and tired.At the ASPVA, we found he was not microchipped and there was no collar or tags, so we guess he was dropped off in the woods. After a little while, we noticed he had a lump on his belly that seemed to cause him pain so we took him to the vet and they diagnosed it as an umbilical hernia that will need surgery.We weren't prepared to find a new friend, but we did so we accept responsibility for what happens to him. And that responsibility is to get him better and adopted.Would you please consider donating to help this little guy get the surgery he needs so he can be happy, healthy, and find a forever home?

Animal Kill Shelter Awareness Film,$480 ,"$2,500 ",Animals," August 25, 2016",17,1,PORTLAND,ME,624000,1,2,"

PORTLAND, ME                                





                        Hey everyone!I'm making a documentary called Together We Walk.The purpose of the film is to raise awareness about animal kill shelters in America. The film will also help raise money for the Animal Refuge League.The film follows me and my dog Sadie on the Appalachain Trail as we stop into towns and visit animals shelters along the east coast. We will be talking with many professionals to get a full scope of animal kill shelters in America.Me and Saide met last September when I adopted her from a kill shelter in Minnesota. Sadie was running out of time in her shelter, so without much thought I flew from Maine to rescue her. My problem: I only had enough money for a one way ticket, and I wasn't sure how I would get back. After I had efficiently depleted most of the funds in my bank account, I decided to ride share and couch surf 1,500 miles back to Maine. I made it all the way to Grand Rapids, Michigan. And then this happened. 

Before I rescued Sadie I didnt fully understand the extent of euthanasia in America. It took me seeing these animals on death row to realize there was a problem. Through this experience I learned a lot that I can share with others. I believe the best way to raise awareness is through film.Why the Appalachian trail?I love hiking and being outdoors. I have always wanted to hike the Appalachian trail; but It's been hard to make the time. I've become drawn to the idea of connecting with nature, and taking a break from the mundane routine of society. I realized we had an opportunity to talk about something important. So I combined these two ideas of adventure and animal awareness to make a educational film people would enjoy.My first goal with this film was to engage the community and see if the idea was worth pursuing. In just the past few months my team and I have engaged thousands of people, and have received a lot of positive feedback; which is a success in itself!We also launched a Kickstarter for the film in July, unfortunately we came up short so we didn't receive any funding. Budget PlanTo make this film happen we need to raise $20,000. I realize this is a big goal.So for now, we are starting with our micro goal of $2,500. This will help us get started and begin our journey. Helping Local Animal Shelters This film is about raising awareness, but we wanted to go further; Therfor 10% of film revenue will be donated to the animal refuge league.And 100% of all revenue after we reach our goal of $20,000 will be donated to the Animal Refuge League.

Gut Wrenching Trip:At the beginning of September, an amazing friend and I drove 37 hours to save puppy mill French Bulldogs. Susan and I will forever be broken by our trip. We will never be able to forget the nauseating smell and sight of hundreds of suffering dogs covered in feces and urine and living on nothing but metal wire. The desperate barks and cries of the innocent begging for help pierced our hearts and souls. Even though the dogs lost all hope, they found the energy and spirit to come up to usand ask to be saved. Because of this gut wrenching experience, I will devote most of our rescueto saving puppy mill dogs no matter what it takes.With this trip, we were able to rescue four sick Frenchies who went through hell and needed immediate medical attention. They suffered from giardia, coccidia, roundworms, and other intestinal parasites. All of the dogs need medications, vaccines and spay/neuter surgery. One needs Vulvoplasty surgery for chronic bladder infections. She may also need knee surgery for luxating patellas (floating kneecaps). The Frenchies are safe and healing in loving palaces. Freeing and treating puppy mill Bulldogs is every expensive. I am a one woman rescue with a handful of fosters. I need ongoing support to rehabilitate and continue our mission. With your generosity, I am able to plan more mill rescue missions. More Protectors means more Frenchies saved! If you cannot donate, please share our fundraiser. We need to build an army of Knights to fight for these noble nuggets!Be a Protector and join our fight against puppy mills!Inspiration:Adeline is Rags To Royals first puppy mill survivor. Because of her appalling life and internal medical issues, I became inspired and dedicated to saving moremill dogs in dire straits. Generous supporters helped me save two more puppy mill moms (Harbin and Pruet) who are now living the lives of queens. With your help, we can turn many Frenchies into Rags To Royals! All three girls would have died, if we didnt save them. Neither could have survived another pregnancy. They all suffered through numerous C sections. Adeline was carrying two deceased babies and had a terrible intestinal infection. Her cervix was adhered to her bladder and her stomach was adhered to her uterus. Adelines vaginal area was infected and such a mess that she underwent Vulvoplasty surgery. Some of Harbins teeth had to be removed from years ofneglect and a poor diet. Her ears were in bad shape with infections. Pruet was vomiting uncontrollably. Her paws were infected from living years in a filthy cage. Pruet was so terrified and ill that she trembled and stood in one place when she felt grass and freedom under her paws. She had no idea what to do outside of a cage. All three girls lived about 6 years without love or comfort. Yet, they are thriving in their forever palacesand adding joy to peoples lives. We want this for other puppy mill dogs!Personal fundraisers receive funds immediately and are charged less in fees. Therefore, I ampersonallymanaging donations for this campaign. Rags To Royals Rescue needs your help and generosity to make a difference. Ourorganization was established to continue Piper The Painting Bulldog's charity work.

Gandalf's Medical treatment fund =(,$335 ,"$3,000 ",Animals," September 22, 2016",13,3,SOMERSET,NJ,146000,,,"






                            Edgar Crdenas Horta
                            
                            
                                                           
SOMERSET, NJ                                





                                                Our cat Gandalf has been diagnosed with a chronic renal disease . Hes now in stage 2 of the disease and is following a change on diet, and taking his meds to prevent an advance to stage 3 and 4. On his last check-up, the vet told us about a stem cells treatment that could regenerate the damaged tissue of the kidneys and recover the organ functionality, so there's big chance to improve Gandalf's quality of life. This treatment is expensive and is way out of our budget, so we ask for your generous help to keep our beloved Gandalf for many more years.The funds will be spent to cover all the treatment and the meds that he has to take to keep this disease at minimun risk.But we are going to let Gandalf tell his own story:Hi there mi name is Gandalf the grey! well in reality I'm a cat but my humans parents gave me that name because they claim that when they found me I filled their lives with magic.I am 3 years old. I got a sister called Mantequilla de Man (Peanut Butter) and to be honest I don't like her very much because she is big and fat and never wants to play with me, even though I never stop trying.Mi favorite things in life are:1.-Sitting by the window. It's very entertaining! See the fast passing cars and dragging the leaves that falls from the trees, see pigeons sleeping and imagining a thousand ways to capture them, but what I love the most is enjoying all the smells and fragrances that the wind brings home.2.-Capturing paper balls. Best Game Ever! some say that this are dog's things but I don't care, it makes me extremely happy when my parents throw me those little paper balls and I run faster than a Lynx to catch'em.3. Q-tips! Q-tips! Q-tips! The first time I saw one of these magic sticks with spongy tips like clouds I knew it was my first love. I pur, I melt, I miaow and blink very slow but it seems nobody understands me and let me play with my beloved Q-tips. I heard them saying it's dangerous because I might swallow them but... Bah! That's bullshit (Even though once I swallowed a needle but that's another story).4. Snuggle in the most comfortable beds in all the house: Heads, backs and foot of mom and dad. Every night after my adventures there's no other play I rather be than on top of my humans.And if you still don't believe I'm one of the happiest cats in the planet let me tell you I'm also a great hunter (specially of shadows, spots and holes) Love to speak to closed doors (Specially at 2 AM when everyone's sleeping) but because I'm thoughtful I give moral support to my parents in their house chores, when they sleep, eat, work and watch TV, making sure to stay close just in case they need me.A few weeks ago I was minding my own catish business when suddenly I felt a huge pain in my tummy, I thought perhaps I ate too much at lunch and when I was going to find my sister to play a little bit PAFF.. let it rip! I already barfed before (pellet/hair/things can't remember when I ate them) but never felt so bad. It was like I was very tired and just want to lay down forever.After too many scary trips in Kennel to dark tunnels and torture chambers that humans call ""The Vet"" I finally knew something happened. I inherited from my mother a cat's disease called ""Chronic Renal disease"" but in reality didn't understand much, to me only meant that I couldn't do my favorite things, and see my parents saaad aaall the time.One of those trips I had to do to the vet, I knew a new doctor that told me something amazing and for the first time my humans and I smiled again. She told us of and Innovative and special treatment that helps kitties when they have faulty thing inside like me and that could make me live a life (Or 9 lives sort of speak) long and happy.The treatment is stem cells treatment and it consists in retiring a little bit of tissue from my legs (Ouch!) and extract from there some super powerful and healing cells, then they reinsert them in my body so they could start their journey to my kidneys and repair the damaged tissue and improve their functionality; Translation: I could plaaaaayyyy, Run, Jump, Eat, Follow my sister and live a looong time with my family!My vet says I'm the perfect candidate for the treatment because I'm young, strong and my disease is still in stage 2 the right one to begin the procedure. This gives good expectations of it to work and that everything goes wonderful!Sadly, where I live this is still a very new treatment and there are little places with the knowledge and the proper instruments to make it happen, my parents doesn't have the budget to pay for the treatment to treat me now. I've been trying to find a job in cat's world (Very good singer, extremely photogenic and I know a few magic tricks) but I've been told I have to rest and gather strength to recover quickly and do my treatment.That's why the cats and humans of our family call for help, We appreciate infinitely any support you could give even if it is only to share my story, I personally after recovery will send you a autographed head shot doing what I love the most... Living the perfect cat's life!

The Portland, CT Police Department is looking for assistance in raising funds in support of a K9 program. The department has been without a work dog since our last handler retired. Sgt. James Kelly, a 22 year veteran has been selected as the Department's next K9 officer and is expected to start training in October 2016. The K9 will be patrol and narcotics certified. Funds raised will be used for the purchase of a police German Shepard, cost of training and equipment. A K9 unit is an extremely valuable asset to our Police Department which aids in protecting our community. This is a large cost for our small department to cover and we are hoping the public's generosity will get us to our goal. Thank you in advance for your support.

Taken out of what I could only describe as hell. She was in a stall 10x4 Her shelter she had to duck to go under. Standing on months maybe even years of feces. Her hooves are well over 4 inches long. And her coat is matted and muddy. Her diet was literally corn stalks. Yes corn stalks. And she lived beside a pen of about 60 goats. And many chickens.Baby is very shy of handling. Though she will let you pick up her front feet and fidget when you pet her. She won't let you handle her back feet but that's understandable with how her hooves look and she lacks the trust. This will be a lengthy Rehab and costly vet bills. As we will have to sedate her to handle her back feet. Not to mention food & board. But she's in a healthier place now and will be on the mend! Anything helps! And a big THANK YOU! <3 <3 From both our hearts!

                        My best friend Cassidy is fighting an awful canine cancer known as transitional cell carcinoma. There is an inoperable tumor in her urethra, and the only hope to prolong her life is an expensive radiation protocol,followed by chemotherapy. Cassidy is a 10 year old yellow Labrador that came from Southern California Labrador Rescue almost 9 years ago, following the deaths of my father, and my dog Jazz. Soon after Cassidy came to live with me I lost my mother. Cass has been my constant companion through a half dozen of my surgeries, including the latest in May for kidney cancer. I have not been able to work since last winter, and having both Cassidy and I sick at the same time has been difficult, financially and emotionally. She is my very best friend ever, and I am committed to doing anything and everything I can to give her a longer, high quality of life. I'd rather live in a tent in the desert with her than in a mansion without her. She's my girl, and I love her more than anyone or anything.Any money raised will be used for diagnostic costs, including blood work, CT scans, ultrasound expenses, and x-rays, radiation therapy ($10,000+), chemotherapy, and any other expenses that we incur saving her life. Anyone that has ever met her would tell you that she is an outstanding friend that is wellworth saving, but I can't do it without help, and we need that help right now.I know it's a lot to ask, but if you can find it in your heart to help us, I would be eternally grateful.

LOVELAND, CO                                





                        Here is a little about Tyler, from Tyler himself...My name is Tyler Graff. I am a Loveland, Colorado native, having graduated in 2008 from Loveland High School. I currently reside in Ohio as I train for a spot on the United States Olympic Wrestling team, hoping to represent the USAat the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.I first took the mat at age four and have loved wrestling ever since. I competed locally for Metro Junior Wrestling League during my younger years and was a four-time State Champion for Loveland High School. I soon after received a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin-Madi- son to continue my passion for wrestling while furthering my education.While at the University of Wisconsin, I became a four-time All-American at the Division One NCAA Championships. I was also awarded Most Dedicated Wrestler for two years, Most Valuable Wrestler, and Most Passionate Wrestler. I had the opportunity to travel the world and represent the United States in two Junior World Championship tournaments, one in Beijing, China, and one in Istanbul, Turkey. I also competed in one world tournament in Kazan, Russia. I received my degree in Non-profit Business Community Leadership in 2014 from the University of Wisconsin and feel very blessed to have had the opportunities I did while wrestling for the Badgers program.In the 2012 Olympic Trials, I placed third, just three spots away from joining the Olympic wrestling team. I used this experience to fuel my later trainings and better myself as a wrestler. As a result, my dream of joining the United States Olympic team is still very much alive. I have committed my time and God-given talent to training and preparing for the next Olympic games. My training combines everyday practice, drills, nutrition, and, most importantly, mindset, keeping my childhood dream of representing the United States of America in the Olympic games in my sight at all times. It is just within my reach.As an athlete, training for an opportunity this incredible takes a lot of time and hard work. It also requires many financial obligations; travel and lodging, wrestling equipment and tournament fees are only a small portion of the costs required to achieve my goal, and they add up quickly.I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to consider contributing financial support to a home- town boy with big dreams. I would be honored to receive any support you can offer, personally and financially, in order to help me see my dream come true.Sincerely, Tyler Graff

                        This is Mac! We adopted him 2/28/16. Originally we thought Mac was abused or hit by a car. After some vet visits and a CT Scan we learned that Mac was born deformed. His face and nasal passage was not fully developed. He has cloudy vision in his left eye and has congenital sinus infections. He struggles with breathing especially in the morning and at night. We use a humidifier twice a day but he truly needs a high cost surgery to help him live a happy and healthy life. We have applied for a grant and if it gets accepted, any money we raise will be donated to help other animals in need. Please Help Mac breathe easy!!

Zeus' chance at a really great life,"$3,525 ","$4,000 ",Animals," July 1, 2016",69,2,DALLAS,TX,1300,1,7,"

DALLAS, TX                                





                        I've got to be honest. We are all worn to the brink of quitting rescue. It is hard, really hard. It is constant, every single minute of every single day. We let relationships go by the way side. We let family problems get bigger. We lose our minds each minute, because there is another one we can't save. We feel like we are constantly begging for money but rescue isn't free and it isn't cheap. Every now and then you will pull a dog from a shelter that doesn't cost an arm and a leg but those aren't the dogs that we typically pull. We rescue pit bulls. We rescue those dogs that have breed bans against them, that have been tortured, that have been made to fight, that no one else wants, that are dumped and discarded like trash. What we see if this diamond in the rough. We feel like they can turn people's minds inward so they can see something besides ""Pit Bull"" Terriers. We do everything single thing in our power and our pocket book to make them the most adoptable dogs they can be.Zeus is one of those. Zeus was surrendered to a high kill shelter in the Dallas area, badly injured. The shelter wasn't sure what was wrong with him. His legs kept slipping out from underneath him and he seemed like he wasn't focusing well. He was eating and drinking but after a week or so in the shelter, he wasn't doing well and needed out. We found a wonderful lady who was willing to foster him so we could get our vet to try and help him get better. Our vet soon discovered the horror of what was Zeus' start to life. (He was only 4 months old when we pulled him from the shelter-just a puppy, a sweet puppy). Our vet determined that he had fractures to 7 vertabrae in his spine that had already started healing wrong. He also thought he may have had some extensive trauma to his head, ears and neck. What happened, you ask? It was the best guess of all the vet's that treated Zeus, that he was not hit by a car, like first thought at the shelter. He was probably picked up by his back legs and slammed, repeatedly, up against a wall, door, floor. Possibly because he pottied in the house or who knows. We just don't understand why humans torture animals. More than likely, that is how his spine ended up fractured. You would never have known that this was the start to this gorgeous boys life. He wagged his tail for every human he saw, he ran like a big boy, even if his legs fell out from underneath him, and he played like a regular dog, full of love. Zeus has suffered unimaginable hurt. We aren't sure why. We can only guess a sociopath had him as a puppy. Someone with no moral compass or feelings. Zeus' foster thought he would always be disabled so she decided to adopt him. A year later Zeus started feeling better and after 15 months, you could not tell he was the way he was as a puppy, at all. As a matter of fact, Zeus started displaying aggressive behavior towards his adoptive mom, to the point that she felt fear. At this point, we knew Zeus was not in the right place for him and he was not the right fit for his adoptive family. They surrendered him back to us. Then starts Zeus' life all over again. He was so confused and depressed.Zeus went directly into training. Training that did absolutely no good. Basically a waste of money for our rescue. It broke our hearts. We have tried experienced fosters and none are good for our boy. We contacted a VERY experienced trainer (who will be training our Lacey girl) and he will be assessing and then formally training Zeus so he can learn how to handle his ""Zeus headland"" behavior. We know that it must sound ridiculous to try another trainer and other models of dog behaviorlism but if you have ever met Zeus, you know that we just have to try one more time. Do you know how many dogs we could have saved with the money we have spent on Lacey and Zeus?? Yes, well we do too and we wouldn't change a thing. Every single one of them deserves a shot. A great shot. New manners and a new outlook on life is what Zeus needs. We want to give it to him but we can't do it on our own. We count on the generosity of others. Those who believe in us, know how hard we work and know that sometimes we just want to give up, because it's so freaking HARD. We are all broke, tired and work full time jobs. We max out credit cards, don't pay a bill and live on the edge of our seats every month. This thing called rescue is so hard. It's painfully hard. But its necessary, especially in Texas!If you care, please share our plea for our boy Zeus. We will have our two most amazing pibbles in training at the same time. Great training. Not mediocre training. A behaviorlist that can really get into their heads. This trainers work is guaranteed. He will not waste our time or our precious resources. We need this for Zeus. This is his last shot. If he goes through training and we discover his brain damage is too much, we will let him go peacefully, after the best day of his life.....but, we so have faith that this isn't it for Zeus. That he will discover new ways to deal with his dogginess. That he will learn to be the dog he's always wanted to be. Zeus isn't called King Zeus for nothing. He's a bad ass but also the biggest cuddle bug on this earth. Every dollar helps. We continue to hope that we are always doing the right thing. We save dogs. That's what we do. It's in our blood. As much as we want to give up and throw in the towel, we can't. Bull luv able Paws Rescue is here to stay.Thank you for donating and sharing our plight.

                        When we moved to Dallas we were dead broke, and had one dog. Young and excited to start our lives here, we made the decision to rescue another dog. For us, she is a great companion, for our other dog, Jayce, Charley is his very best friend. They've been inseparable since day one. We soon realized that Charley was more than just a pet. She's been so loyal to us since the very first day we met her, she's eager to please and loves everyone she meets - despite what she's been through in the past.We've officially had her for one year as of July. I couldn't be more proud to say that she is truly the best dog I have ever, ever had. (Shhhh don't tell Jayce).A few days ago Charley was diagnosed with Heart Worm disease. When our vet was telling us the news, I couldn't help but think ""How did this happen?"" We felt awful, like the world's worst dog parents. How could we have not known? Well, Charley was not showing any symptoms at all. She's running, playing, and cuddling just as she normally does.Thankfully, treatment is possible. She can be saved, but my vet has stressed that there will most likely be some damage to her heart and lungs as a result of the disease. Today she had her X-rays and was given some medication to prepare her for her next steps of treatment. We have set up a payment plan with our vet, and have 6 months to repay the entire treatment. It's far from being affordable for us so we are asking for any donations to help save Charley's heart.Every little bit helps.Thank you.- Angie, Austin, Jayce & Charley.

                        Hi everyone,I am here because my awesome sister and her dog Philly are in trouble.A few weeks ago, Philly had minor surgery to remove some skin cancer and do some dental work. Since then, he's been very sick. Throwing up, coughing, etc.He's been in and out of the hospital for weeks and they still can't get him all fixed up. They say he has esophigitis and have been keeping him in the hospital overnight with IV's and on liquid diets. They've also done a procedure to stretch his esophagus but might need to do it again. He returned to the hospital yesterday and might have to be put on a feeding tube to help him heal.We can't understand how this happened right after a minor surgery. They claim that these things ""just happen"", but it doesn't add up to me.We are hoping people can support Tricia in the funds for his medical bills, which are already over $8,000.00. The money will go directly to his veterinary bills.Anyone who knows Tricia knows she loves everyone and is so incredibly selfless and giving. Anyone who knows Philly knows how obvious it is that he was raised by her, because he is exactly the same way. She shouldn't have to go through this financial burden and he doesn't deserve the hard times and pain he's in right now.Please help support us. Any little bit helps and we are so grateful for whatever you can give! If you can't give, we'd be just as grateful for you to share this with your friends and family so they can help.If by some miracle we raise enough to cover his veterinary bills, all extra donations will be contributed towards Big Dog Ranch Rescue - a local rescue near Tricia that saves a lot of doggies and adopts them out!

URGENT FUNDING NEED FOR CALIFORNIA WOLVESWe dont want livestock to die because of wolves and we dont wolves to be killed because of livestock. This is the philosophy guiding our work with the ranching community sharing the landscape with wild wolves. Northern California ranchers are stewards of much of the open space where wolves are starting to return and will reside in the future. Because of this, we have embarked on a road less traveled by partnering with ranchers. Successful coexistence between wolves and livestock is possible if we provide proactive and nonlethal tools!Due to the vast open rangeland in the northern state, the use of Ranger Riders is the best option for successful coexistence between wolves and livestock. As wolves are inherently shy of humans, providing a human presence through Range Riders deters wild wolves from approaching the area and they can move cattle if needed.Recently, we participated in a four day Range Rider training hosted in Tom Miner Basin, Montana. The class combined the fields of ranching and wildlife conservation with the intent of seeking creative solutions for moving forward on today's landscape. Thanks to your support, we were also able to provide funding for two Northern California ranchers who operate in potential wolf habitat to participate as well!With this training completed, we now have the tools necessary to launch Californias inaugural Range Rider program! We also have numerous individuals within the Northern California ranching community wanting to be involved. It is critical that this campaign is successful in order to fully implement this essential coexistence program. Help us raise the final funds of this campaign to ensure the Range Rider program is as successful as it truly needs to be!Wild wolves in California need Ranger Riders. Wild wolves in California deserve Range Riders.

PALMER, MA                                





                        Sarge is a 17-year-old discarded trail horse, he is going blind. In August of 2014, he was at auction about to be purchased by a slaughterhouse kill buyer when the angels at Dorset Equine Rescue stepped in and outbid the buyer and bought him for $525.  He is 90 per cent blind in one eye, 100 per cent blind in the other, and he will soon lose sight completely.Dorset Rescue spent nine months looking for a home for him. No one would even return their calls. Blue Star Equiculture in Palmer, Mass. accepted him immediately, asking only if he still had his spirit. He does. On April 9, Blue Star, a draft horse retirement and rescue and organic farming center, picked up Sarge and brought him home, where he will live out the rest of his life with dignity and love. Right now, he is sharing a run-in with Gulliver, a feral horse found living in the forests of Vermont by some children. He is safe and happy here, Gulliver will be Sarge's companion.We are seeking your help in giving Sarge the life he deserves, that all horses and animals deserve. The money will be used to pay for the special hay and grain he will need, and most importantly, for the special veterinary care he will need now and well into the future.It costs more than $6,000 a year just to feed a working horse, and we have more than 30 at Blue Star. Many are older and have had health problems or been cruelly treated and need special care. We urgently need your help to care for Sarge, he is a sweet and generous and forgiving animal. Blue Star believes in honoring the legacy of the horses that helped build American and have served people for thousands of years. They have been forgotten. We support the work of animals and people together, we provide the horses with the best possible and most loving care. You can visit us on our Facebook page or follow Sarge's journey at  www.equiculture.org .This is a terrible time for the horses, more than 155,000 horses in America are taken to slaughter each year in Mexico and Canada in the most brutal fashion. We are committed at Blue Star Equiculture to remembering our sacred duty to them, to keeping them in our lives. Thanks for helping Sarge.

The building currently housing our rescue dogs is being sold
and we need to raise $370,000 towards the purchase a new building. Two major animal advocates are generously supporting our new kennel endeavor. The ASPCA has contributed $60,000 and Best Friends Animal Society has contributed $100,000. Please help
us to reach our goal. Time is of the essence! 

We
need to outright own a building, so these dogs are guaranteed a place
to stay while we prepare them for adoption as family pets.

We've
found a property for sale in South Gate, with an existing structure
that can be easily modified to suit our needs. It's not a brand new, modern building, but with the right amount of work, it is
the answer to our prayers. 


I've
put my own personal home up as collateral, which is the most
terrifying thing I've ever done in my life, but I believe with all of
my heart and soul it's the right thing to do.
Our goal is to pay cash for the property so
that we can continue to run our program in under served communities
with resources and services to prevent pets from entering the shelter
system. If we have to carry a mortgage, continuing to do what we do is going to be very challenging.If we can pay cash and outright own this larger building, not only will we be able to rescue additional dogs, 
but it will also allow us to give back through
our shelter intervention program, covering needs that current grants may not 
meet.We
see a lot of families going through financial challenges. Loss of a
job, home or other uncontrollable life event often leading to the
family feeling as if they have no alternative but to surrender their
pet to a shelter. 
Sometimes
if a pet's need can be solved by vet care, training, food, etc., it's the
difference between the animal entering the shelter or being able to
stay with their family.

any organization/Facebook page you can think of. 
Your donation or social media share helps us rescue shelter dogs in Los Angeles and 
continue our shelter intervention program.With many thanks,Lori WeiseFounder, Downtown Dog Rescue http://www.downtowndogrescue.org/About Downtown Dog Rescue.We have
been recognized for our work by the Department of Animal Services for
the City of LA, Best Friends and Humane Society of the United States.
We are a 12 year old, legitimate 501c3 Charity and an all volunteer organization that spends over 90% of our funding on
the animals.
We have provided
over 10,000 free spay/neuter surgeries in some of the poorest areas
in the Greater Los Angeles. We have recently expanded our South LA Shelter Intervention Program to full time,
preventing more than 1,000 pets from entering the shelter since April of 2013. 
About the property.
The
property is located South Gate, in the heart of a
working class community that struggles with over population of pets - especially pit bulls. The Animal Control agency, SEACCA has given us
their full support. About the expanded DDR programs for the new kennel. The
new Downtown Dog Rescue kennel will work towards generating income for rescue/shelter intervention by offering training and doggy day care/boarding. We are extremely adept at training and providing the love, care and structure required for happy, well adjusted dogs. We'll offer these services to the general public, and of course to our DDR adopters.This larger kennel property and revenue generated from the new programs will allow us to continue to take dogs that are often overlooked at the shelter. This includes dogs
with medical/behavioral issues and senior dogs, and more of the
dogs on the verge of being surrendered to the South LA shelter.
Since DDR will outright own the property, there is a solid foundation for all of
the dogs entering our program. This means there will be no time limit set for any dog
based on funding.
All of our dogs that live at the kennel play twice
a day every day, for several hours. Beyond traditional training/doggy day care and boarding, we plan on hosting
seminars on how to build and maintain play groups with rescue dogs,
teaching more rescue and shelter volunteers how to increase adoptions
by promoting play. Why play behavior = more adoptions.We are a unique rescue
that can take dogs that often other rescues with foster homes or
traditional boarding cannot take because we have a pack of dogs that
teach the dogs in our program how to play. Every dog is ""put to
work"" and has a ""job"" and a purpose until they find their
forever home. No dog sits in a run waiting for the day they are
adopted. 

Through play, dogs that come to
our program with dog aggression, fear, lack of socialization with
people and/or dogs, build confidence and gain social skills that
enable them to become more adoptable. 


There will be multiple
play yards for various types of dogs from small dogs to large breed
dogs, to senior dogs.  At the present time, our kennel is
structured so that we can't take in dogs under 35 lbs due to safety
concerns. With just under 8300' feet of property, the new DDR kennel will have special runs and a play area for
small dogs and senior dogs that need more quiet time. We'll also be creating a play area with agility equipment.Please click the donate button to make a profound difference in a dog's life. Thank you. Lori WeiseFounder, Downtown Dog Rescue http://www.downtowndogrescue.org/

HAMBURG, PA                                




This isthe face I fell in love with at the Hope 4 Hannah Rescue. His name was Kiko. At the tender age of 10 weeks old we brought him home and named him Murphy Abner Du'.   He has been sick from day 1 but with alot of TLC he overcame them all. Now at the tender age of 10 months old, our vet this morning informed us that he has congenital hip issues that need immediate attention. (what this means is that Du' has no ball joints and bone is rubbing on bone, so severely that he must have been born with it). As of right now he needs to have one hip done immediately and eventually after the first one heals the second hip will have to be done. Each hip operation cost 2500.00, that is the cheapest the vet could find.  My heart raced, my hands starting to shake and the floor fell out from under my feet. 2500.00 might as well be 1,000,000.00. Du' and I drove home, i lifted him into his favorite reclining chair, sat down on the floor in front of him and rested my forehead against his. He quietly whimpered and thumped his tail, but not because of the pain he was having, but rather because i was crying and he wanted to comfort me.How can i put my baby to sleep? He's worth the fight, and fight I am going to do. I have never asked anyone for anything but I will now. Please help me to help Du'. All donations will go to my veternarian. Prayers are a huge welcome also.If mailing a check:Bliss Haven94 Academy RdHamburg Pa 19526Make sure to say for the Du' fundThank you for kindness

                        Friends of the Westchester Dog Park is a group of Westchester residents and their families who see a need for an off-leash dog park in our Village. We have received approval from the Westchester Park District to spearhead the fundraising efforts to make this park a reality by the spring of 2016. The appropriated parcel of land for the dog park is on the 1100 block of Norfolk ave, next to the existing Norfolk Park Playground. The Norfolk Dog Park is viewed as a canine complement to the towns existing public parks and recreation department. This is where your partnership can make a difference. Donating to the Westchester Dog Park will help offset costs for items such as Fencing, signage, benches, paver bricks, shade trees, and landscaping materials. Together, we can help families in our community by providing a safe place for off-leash play.  We are completely dedicated to this important cause, but we cannot do it alone. Our sincere hope is that you will donate to our cause. All donations are tax-deductible. FOr those donating that would like to take advantage of the tax-deduction please provide name/mailing address and a letter will bemailed to you with tax information. Thank you in advance for your support.

I am from a small village in northern England, but moved to Mexico over 13 years ago to take part in a sea turtle conservation programme. Throughout my time here I have rescued over 30 abandoned/street dogs and rehomed most of them (I usually have 3 - 4 in my home). They are usually foundin terrible condition and require a lot of veterinary attention and a LOT of food.

I also have two friends who are 'serial rescuers' and we work together to try and help each other out when we can. Between us we are now up to 21 rescues who all need feeding and veterinary attention; this isthe purpose of this fund raising campaign.The aim, of course, is to rehome these dogs, but no sooner than one goes out, another one comes in; sadly this is an ongoing problem in Mexico and we always try to save those lucky enough to cross our paths.We each pay medical and food costs out of our own pockets,but each of us depends on the tourism industry and we havea very seasonal income. None of us are wealthy, but we justcannot leave a starving dog on the street!We (all 24 of us) would be very grateful for any donation amount towards our cause and would like to thank you dearly for reading this!

                        The Beaumont Police Department is starting a new Search and Rescue and Narcotics Detection K9 program. The Beaumont Police Department is seeking donations to help acquire, train and maintain a detection canine.A detection canine is a valuable resource to our community. Detection dogs have been utilized in law enforcement service for over thirty years. A trained detection dog can locate missing persons and hidden narcotics that may be difficult, if not, impossible to locate by a human. A canine can do a detailed search in a building and or large area in a fraction of the time it would take a team of officers. There is no match for a well-trained K-9 detection team. This program has the potential to prevent the loss of life, save man hours for police officers and reduce narcotic activity in the community. As well as providing a valuable training asset to local schools by assisting in drug prevention programs and demonstrations. Through your generous donations and with the support of our community members, business owners and other stakeholders the potential to have an outstanding K9 Program is limitless.Donations can be made here orto the City of Beaumont attention: Police Canine Fund, or follow us on Facebook to find out other ways to support our K9 Program. For further information about our program or if you have questions, please contact Officer Ryan Brieda at 951-769-8500, or email to Rbrieda@Beaumontpd.orgSincerely, Sean ThuilliezChief of PoliceBeaumont Police DepartmentBeaumont Police Department Facebook

This isthe face I fell in love with at the Hope 4 Hannah Rescue. His name was Kiko. At the tender age of 10 weeks old we brought him home and named him Murphy Abner Du'.   He has been sick from day 1 but with alot of TLC he overcame them all. Now at the tender age of 10 months old, our vet this morning informed us that he has congenital hip issues that need immediate attention. (what this means is that Du' has no ball joints and bone is rubbing on bone, so severely that he must have been born with it). As of right now he needs to have one hip done immediately and eventually after the first one heals the second hip will have to be done. Each hip operation cost 2500.00, that is the cheapest the vet could find.  My heart raced, my hands starting to shake and the floor fell out from under my feet. 2500.00 might as well be 1,000,000.00. Du' and I drove home, i lifted him into his favorite reclining chair, sat down on the floor in front of him and rested my forehead against his. He quietly whimpered and thumped his tail, but not because of the pain he was having, but rather because i was crying and he wanted to comfort me.How can i put my baby to sleep? He's worth the fight, and fight I am going to do. I have never asked anyone for anything but I will now. Please help me to help Du'. All donations will go to my veternarian.

                        Lilly the pet pig is 5 years old. She was placed in Boarding for a few days while her owner had to go out of town. With in 48 hours of being at the Boarding facility Lilly was kicked , hit , whipped, pushed down and other unimaginable things . She was screamed at and punched in the face . Just treated horribly . . The emotional, physical scars are herenedous . Lilly lost use of her rear legs and is no longer able to walk or stand, she also can't move her Bowels or eat/drink. Lilly's owner was concerned when the boarding facility wasn't returning her phone calls . She drove to boarding and found her pet pig Lilly almost lifeless. She rushed her to the emergency hospital where she has been for a several days . She requires a massive amount of medical care , therapy , X-rays, pain meds , IV and time to recover . They want to take a MRI but that is very expensive . We need to raise money for Lily's care at the hospital and for post care. She will be saved and will eventually walk again . There may be issues but she should be able to live out a happy life at home . No animal should suffer at the hands of a human . Pigs are gentle and loving animals that are smart and sensitive. Please help Lilly the pot belly pig get her MRI and medical care so she can recover and walk again. Thank you .

                        So I've had Maxwell since he was 2 weeks old, I bottle fed him! He is now 5 1/2 years old and over the past few weeks he's lost weight, become lethargic and his breathing has becomefaster and more labored. When we went to the vet today he said he felt some type of cyst on Max's kidney. In order to see if it is something treatable or if it is something worse that has spread, we need both x-rays and blood work which we were quoted at about $500-$1000. He needs this done asap! I've never asked for money before, however times have become tough and that much money is not something I have on hand. I'd do anything to help my baby, so I am asking for help for him. Anything, even $5 would be a help. I'd be forever grateful for any help.

                        I amraising money fora small veterinary clinic in The Gambia in West Africa so they can purchaseNexGard in quantity. NexGard is the best, longest-lastingprotection against the parasite called Mangoworm.A Mangoworm isthe larval stage of a blowfly. (Mangoworms have nothing to do with mangoes the fruit.)Dr. Michael Meyers provides charity care for many dogsand cats. His clinicrelies heavily on our generosity. The Trap/Neuter/Vaccinate/Deworm/Delouse/Return programwould be unthinkable without financial help from abroad.All stray and ""free-roaming pet"" dogs and cats treated by the clinic are infested with Mangoworms, ticks,and fleas.These parasites become life-threatening as theysuck the blood from their animal host. As you see in the video, puppies' health isespecially vulnerable to the parasites.Mangoworms must be removed by hand -- labor intensive indeed. NexGard can protect for up to 2 months and could be a game-changer against Mangoworms! Sadly, NexGard is very expensive - $15 per treatment. That is a high price for a clinic operating on a limited budget.Every dollar I raise will be sent directly to the clinic. The sooner I can send money, the sooner the dogs and cats will find some relief. I would like to send the funds no later than September 30, 2016.The animals, Dr. Meyers, his staff, and I appreciateany amount you can give. Nothing is too big or too little. Thank you very much.For more information about the clinic, please visit  www.vetclinicgambia.com You can see all the Clinic's videos on  www.YouTube.com/VetClinicGambiaThere is a short history of Dr. Meyer here http://www.historyandheadlines.com/vet-clinic-gambia-charity-four-legged-furry-friends-africa/

                        Hello everyone, we are seeking your help to save our baby. Chewbacca is our little brussel griffon who holds a very important part in our lives and in our hearts. Yesterday, he was viciously attacked by a neighbor's german shepherd who grabbed our chewy by his neck and swung him around leaving 9 puncture wounds, multiple fractures, internal bleeding and fluid in his lung. We rushed him to an animal hospital where he was immmediately put into intensive care and connected to a respirator and sedated. The vets told us that he is extremely fragile right now and in a very bad condition. They wouldn't operate on him unless we paid the estimated amount of $17,000 necessary for his surgery. Unfortunately, because this operation is not affordable, he had to be discharged. Removing him from vet care set him back and he is in tremendous pain. Desperately seeking help he was taken to the ASPCA where they were not able to help. Within the same hour he was taken to another animal hospital in hopes of receiving a lower estimate which is where he is now being kept on machines until we can come up with the funds. Chewy will die if he is not helped. Anyone who loves animals knows that they are more than pets. He is only 6 and deserves to continue to enjoy his life. He is the beloved baby of the family, we bring this dog everywhere with us he is like a child to us. Whatever you could donate to the cause would help us tremendously and please spread the word!!!! Note: Updates will be given....estimate will be posted as soon as we receive it if he makes it through the night. Any and all information can be provided to proof legitimacy. Also, contributions can be made directly to the animal hospital. Thank you all so much for taking your time to read this!

                        Hello. My name is Shanae Heard. I am a Junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Psychology. I have Cerebral Palsy and use a wheelchair for mobility. I have always loved dogs and wanted one as my own. I've been living in Lincoln since late April and living independently, and a service dog would greatly improve my life around campus and town. A dog would also be able to help me with retrieving dropped objects, helping me get in and out of doors and other tasks that will make life in a chair easier. I'm now working with Russ Dillion of Dillion's Dog training in Omaha Nebraska to adopt and train a dog who meets my needs. The total cost for training services is about $3300 tax included. There's also a $200 fee for the dog's service dog kit and registration. Please consider donating, and if you're unable to do so, a simple share would be greatly appreciated.

                        Hello Friends, Fam, Fam Friends, Acquaintances, Colleagues, Humans from all over, My name is Ilyssa, and my best friend, her name is Puffina. She is a 9 month old Welsh Corgi from Maryland. Puff has been in my life since February of 2016. She is hands down the best thing to ever happen to me. She's had a bit of a rough child hood, when she was just 10 weeks old her back paws went numb and she was unable to walk. After hours at the vet, countless blood tests and x-rays everything seemed normal. She spent the night at the HOPE center, and they saved her life, but it pretty much sucked my savings dry. She was only 10 weeks old when this happened, so I scrounged for every penny I had and I made it work. After all, she gives me unconditional love, so it's the least I could do. Things progressed as normal, or so we thought. She jumped on everything, which meant she jumped off everything. At some point in her early childhood Puff sustained an injury to her Growth Plate on/below her Ulna, which has caused problems for her bones as her growth plates harden during their final stage (calcification...or something like that). There are plenty of other medical terms that I am not familiar with that describe how her Ulna and Humorous will not be able to join together unless she has corrective surgery to do so, but I will refrain and just hit you with the facts. Puff will need surgery in the next few weeks. She needs the surgery before she gets too old, or the growth plate will harden and tear her elbow apart. If we don't do the surgery she will inevitably be in so much pain that she wouldn't be able to walk on it at all, resulting in some other form of surgery at some point down the line. She is only 9 months old, she needs this surgery to improve her quality of life because she has so much life still to live. Ordinarily I think these platforms are intrusive and kind of wrong to ask people for money for things that are your responsibility....that was until I had a child who needed something that I was unable to give her. Yes I had money saved up to get her through this year...however there were multiple unexpected issues that costed more than I had anticipated. I wasn't sure this was a platform I wanted to use until the other night when one of my very best friends used a line against me that I often use, ""Pride cometh before the fall"". I don't want to sit here and ask you for money, but for my Puff I would do just about anything. If you choose to donate, even $1 please do not do it anonymously because I would LOVE to send you a thank you card! It would mean so much to me, my family, and my bestest friend Empress Puffina. Puff has gotten my family through one of our most hectic and scary times and we owe it to her to try and do the same. Thank you all so much, I wish you nothing but peace and love.-Ilyssa and Puff

Hi my name is Allison and Buddy is our 4 year old German shephered who we adopted from the cranston animal shelter when he was just a 1yr 1/2 about a month after our 16yr German Shephered Rotwieler mix was put to sleep after losing his battle with cancer.
  All of a sudden Buddy became very sick a few months ago. My parents have been taking him back and forth to the vet several times, and have spents thousands trying to find out what is wrong with him. They have exahusted all their funds. If we cant find help we may have to put him to sleep to stop his suffering.
 So what we finally found is that Buddy has a genetic autoimmune disease that has caused several Anal Fistula (anal fishers). He is also believed to have Imflammitory bowl disease, and also caused by genetics. There is a possible blockage of some kind causing loose infrequent stools. He is constantly straining to go with litte to no results. He cries in the process because he is in so much pain. 
  He has been vomitting food and undigested stool every few days.He is not keeping much food in his stomach because he has lost almost all his body fat. Almost every bone can be felt. He is on perscription dog food and he hates it. He is also on a medication they perscribed that costs $100 a month.
  The only thing the vet can do now is scope him to see if they can find a blockage. In order to do that I have to raise money because my poor parents who love him unconditonaly can no longer afford to spend anymore money on treating him. The last thing we want is too put this sweet 4 yr old to sleep. He means the world to me and my family. To some he may be just a dog but to me hes family. Hes my baby and its just not his time. we are completly heart broken and can not bare to lose him. Not now and not like this. Please Pray for him and if you can please donate. Anything helps. God bless you all.

Today we had quite a bit of a scare as I found out Bruno has to have emergency surgery to have a bowel obstruction removed.  As you can imagine this is quite a pricy procedure. While I love my job of teaching, it doesn't exactly bring in the big money and this surgery is going to put a lot of stress on future finances. If you can please consider helping a bit. I know myself and Bruno will be beyond appreciative.

The cost of the surgery is $750.00 and I cannot afford this amount at this time. If you can please kindly support me with any type of donation for his medical expenses.

                        We, at The Barnyard Sanctuary, are so fortunate to have such a wonderful support system and we truly appreciate each and every one of you! Thank you so much for following us and keeping up with all of our animals at the sanctuary. We are a 501c3 non-profit and we rely solely on your support. Right now we have over 700 beautiful animals at our sanctuary and taking care of them is no small task. We understand that things are tough with the stock market relating to oil prices right now, and that may affect your ability to contribute and THATS OK! But, if you are in a position to spare a few dollars, we are in urgent need of help. For the month of January, we only received 20% of our monthly expenses in donations and we are assuming that is due to economic hardships. February is just as bad and this is very frightening. We are setting up this Go Fund Me Campaign in hopes that we will be able to pay the rest of our January expenses and also Februarys. Our goal is to reach $43,000.00 by the first of March. Friends, this is urgent as our animals depend on us. If you can afford to give anything at all, we would really appreciate your help.Most sincerely,Tamala Lester, Founder ofThe Barnyard Sanctuary

She was also certified as a Good Citizen dog the same time they deemed here dangerous.She has been around hundreds of children as well as other dogs in multiple states and there have been no issues.Being labeled ""dangerous"" because she left her electric fence and nipped another dog in Feb 2013 is aggregoius and wrong!The latest allegation Aug2016 and occurance I noticed that she suffered a bite to her face, the other dog whome was ""atatcked"" had no marks...noting ...nada....FACTS!- She is a loving loyal companion to our family and we want her back home where she belongs with her family.Unfortunately, I cant provide the full retainer due to my recent divorce and atty fees and I am asking for my friends and fellow dog lovers help.If I felt for one second that I had a dangerous dog, I wouldnt want to fight so hard and was ""stuck it to"" by the town unfairly.

Lexi Chooses Life but Needs Help,"$2,550 ","$5,500 ",Animals," September 1, 2016",52,24,GREENVILLE,SC,301000,3,8,"






                            Marianne Thompson Barnes
                            
                                                            on behalf of Nancy Collins

GREENVILLE, SC                                





                        I am posting this go fund for my sister, Nancy, so her little Lexi can live a full happy life.  Below the text is written from her heart. Thank you for any help you can give her.""Last year I lost my little fur boy Toby  of 15 years leaving a huge hole in my heart. Then my little angel Lexi was born on October 11. I will always feel Toby sent her to me.  Lexi has been the light of my life. In August Lexi was to be spayed so blood test were run.  Her bile salts came back almost 20 times the normal. Nothing has been right since then. Lexi was seen by a liver specialist who set her up for more extensive testing and likely surgery for a liver shunt.Having a liver shunt means the blood does not go through her little liver causing it to die. The blood is shunted outside the liver instead. All the toxins that the liver filters stays in her blood stream. Ammonia builds up in the bloodstream causing seizures, neurological and behavioral changes. I'm blessed this hasn't happened to my baby, but the doctor said you cannot predict when this could happen. I live each day looking for changes.The other day I found several bruises on her back so she will be returning to the vet. I'm trusting in God's Word that He will protect her.  At the present Lexi is on a special diet that I home cook for her along with several medications. She has been eating great but they want to change her food so I'm praying she will eat it. So far I've spent over $600 trying to find out the diagnosis, vet bills, and medications.  But I'm determined that Lexi will have every chance in the world to survive this. Because of her age I was told she couldn't be managed on medications but would need surgery to give her a full life.Lexi will go to the University of Tennessee on November 1 for almost a week. According to them the extremely elevated bile salt levels indicate the shunt but more testing will be done to make sure of this and to see the location before doing the surgery the next day. The specialist says she could have a condition called an Intestinal Inflammation which is a side effect of liver shunt. She is being treated for this with antibiotics. This keeps bacteria count down in her intestines. I am retiring in October due to age and health problems so this is why we are setting up this fund. Please give my baby a chance to live a normal life. Lexi is full of life and at this time has few symptoms. The University says this is important that she remain so before testing begins, so she will remain on her medication and diet. Lexi  will have to be on medication management for several months before her surgery, so we will wait. We are asking for assistance with charges for testing, staying at a motel and surgery in Tennessee.  Please help my baby because I couldn't imagine my life without her. She is 10 months old and weighs 4.5 pounds.Lexi has had pet insurance with Petplan since she was two months old, but they are refusing to cover a liver shunt. According to their policy they cover genetic problems, but they keep saying it was pre existing even though Lexi was diagnosed at 10 months of age. The waiting period is 14 days. She had no sign until eight months of paying premiums. They said being so small was a sign of liver shunt. I will continue to fight them but I've read that the odds of them paying are very slim. Everyday is important and keeping her healthy until November is essential. Lexi appreciates any help you can give us. May God bless you for loving this fur baby and trying to save her. Any amount we do not use will be donated to other members of Malitoo Club who have puppies with liver shunt/ MVD. Thank you.

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL                                




After decades of unselfish dedication to the animals, hundreds of thousands of dollars and the kind of dedication rarely seen even in movies, the animal rescuer who gave it all away for the animals is himself in need. He overlooked his own future potential needs while guiding others thru emergency situations. He now lives alone with his companion Ruby, a red dobie who watches over him tirelessly. His muscles weak, but trying to rebuild and he is still unable to walk.If anyone has paid it forward, Captain Ron Fach has.In animal rescue, we tend to react most to the injured dog or cat in need. We rush to the rescue of the forgotten and abandoned. All too often the rescuer we all called for help is cast aside when they can no longer perform that miracle save. Let's hope that is not the case this time. If you can spare the time to lend a hand, please reach out HERE.Also, thisfundraisercontribute to Captain Ron's needs entitled Help Rescue Captain Ron has been set up, in hopes he can hire nursing care and other assistance until he can progress to walking again, get long term care or sell his home to fund his own care.Thank you for not overlooking this tragic situation. He would never have done that, and we should step up now that he needs us.All funds will be held in and disbursed through a trust account in accordance with Florida law. Contributions are not tax-deductible.Read more about Captain Ron,Animal Rescuer who gave it all away for the animals. Photo: Sun Sentinel July 5, 1987

Eve's Surgery,$755 ,"$1,000 ",Animals," August 8, 2016",26,1,JERSEY CITY,NJ,84000,,2,"

                        On August 15, 2015, Ivan and I adopted Eve from the Liberty Humane Shelter on Clear the Shelter Day. Prior to Eve ending up in the shelter, she was a stray dog whose history was unknown.She is definitely one of the friendliest and most obdient dogs that we've ever met! We had her for almost a year and since then, we've taken her on many adventures which she absolutely loved: hiking, trips to the lake, long walks in the park and much more! All we want to do is continue to feed her positive vibes which she deserves. We were given the amazing opportunity to take her in and call her ours.When we adopted her, we were informed that she was only 5 years old. Today, after taking her to the vet for a check up, we found out that she is actually 8-9 years old. Along with that, we received devastating news that she has a very serious tumor in her spleen. The doctor calls it ""the silent dog killer"" since it's difficult to notice symptoms before the tumor even grows. She would need to have surgery right away, otherwise, she will bleed internally and we will lose her. Now, given her actual age, it will be a risky procedure.Unfortunately, the surgery is very costly. We are asking for any type of help to come up with the money for Eve, especially with the limited timeframe we were given. Any donation will be greatly appreciated.

                        Lucy was badly injured when surrendered to the shelter on May 2, 2016. She was estimated to be about6 years old-estimated DOB 2010. She was treated for her wounds in the two months she was at the shelter, having 4 surgeries in that time to clean up her deep and infected wounds. She still had a draining wound on her chest when she arrived at MP3 Farms Pet Sanctuary on July 1, 2016. That was treated, and she was started on thyroid replacement to treat her hypothyroidism.She had her severe lameness evaluatedon 8/3/2016; she has ruptured cruciateligaments in both hind legs!She will need them both fixed, but the right will be first because it is the worse of the two.The estimate range is ~$3800-$4500 for the right knee. So for both knees, less our sanctuary discount, it will be approximately $7000-$7500. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit. If any funds over the required amounts are collected, they will be applied to the expenses of our other medically-needy sanctuary animals.Her surgery is scheduled for October 24, however, we need to have the funds for the first surgery available immediately because we are on a standby list in case an earlier appointment opens up.Lucy's significant pain is being managed medically, but after all that she's been through, she deserves the relief that surgical repair will provide. In spite of all she's been through, she is the most friendly, loving dog you will ever meet!Thank you!

We are the Wolfes, and Loki is our 7 month old rescue pup. A previous injury caused damage to a growth plate in his right paw, making his foot grow all wonky. In order to allow his leg to finish growing properly and prevent severe arthritis, he requires major surgery. Our surgeon has estimated the cost of the procedure to be around $3,000. It has been recommended that we have the surgery done as soon as possible. Loki is such a well behaved and loving pup and we know that this surgery is necessary for him to have a happy and pain-free life. Your help will allow us to complete the surgery sooner. The Wolfe household will be a joyous place once our beloved best friend is all fixed up.

                        It feels as though our hearts have been split in two.The same week that our furry four legged kid is injured is the same week we are to welcome our first human kid into our lives.This past week our Penny girl got in a fight with an opossum. Following the opossum attack we got her to our regular vet for what we all thought was a muscular injury due to the fight. We were prescribed anti inflammatories for the week to see if her movement would improve and the muscular discomfort would subside. A few days later she started to develop swelling in her arm and chest and the poor girl was in a lot of pain. Things really took a scary turn when six days after the opossum encounter the swellling on her chest ruptured and the blood colored fluid was releasing from her body. As soon as this swelling ruptured we ran Penny to the ER vet to get her the care she needed as quick as possible. They immediately started her on IV antibiotics and pain meds to make her feel better and start to fight what was happening to her body. After observation at the ER vet overnight and blood tests, we learned that she has a severe infection and the skin in the area they think where the bite ocurred is necrotic. This was far from a fair fight. The opossum came with an arsenal of disease and infection.We were recommended to a specialist that can best care for Penny and treat her.As of right now the treatment plan with the specialist is to remove the necrotic skin and tissue and monitor Penny as she heals to ensure she gets to the other side of this.The fees for seeing a board certified veterinarian surgeon aren't cheap, but we wouldn't have it any other way. All proceeds of this page will go towards Penny's vet bills and treatment. We love our dogs for the love they give us every day, they are our family and we will do whatever we can to protect and care for them.There is no contribution too big or too small to help our furry family. We look forward to bringing home Penny and introducing her to her new human sibling once she is better.

                        As many of you know, animal rescue is one of my big passions in life. Recently, I had the pleasure of fostering a 6 year old male boxer named Chase. I was not planning on fostering him, and had donated to 'Name a Dog' to support Adopt a Boxer Rescue in honor of my boxer Chase's one year passing. Coincidentally, I ended up with him after he proved too strong for his first foster home - one year to the day of Chase's passing.New Chase (Brock as I was calling him) is a sweet, wiggly, loving, kind boxer who has fear based aggression issues with other animals. He was clearly kept outside, you can see from the pressure sores and hair loss on his elbows/legs. He has scars all over his face and legs. I fostered him for 6 weeks and ended up having to bring him to MA because the city was too chaotic for him with all the other dogs running around. It was then that I saw a truly calm amazing dog that was just learning to play with toys. (I don't get money to do this, everything comes out of my pocket).This past Sunday, I drove 8 hours total to drop him off at his adoptive home which sounded phenomenal on 30 acres without any other dogs and boxer experience. I wanted to ensure a smooth transition so I brought him there, made sure he saw me interacting with his adoptive family and snuck out the door quietly. Within5 hours they said they would give him a week, and after24 hours they asked for him to be out ASAP citing issues with other animals like a raccoon outside. Needless to say, I feel like I've failed him and I feel defeated. We have no place to put him, I can't take him back as much as my heart bleeds for him and wants to. We are being forced tokennel him which is driving a dagger in my heart. There are so many causes to donate to, we all know it. But those of you who support my rescue efforts, I'm asking your help to donate whatever you can so I can finish my mission to help save this one special dog. He desparately needs training (and an e-collar) so he can be adopted and his kennel cost is $35/day.All of this because some breeder or pet store somewhere sold a dog to a home that didn't care to even leave a note when they dumped him at Manhattan Animal Care & Control , a high-intake kill shelter.A little bit goes a long way, and thank you.Boxer Wiggles,Emily

                        My dog, Duke, is a seven year old puggle who I love an insurmountable amount. In July he broke his right humerus so badly that it required two surgeries. Now, three months later he has broken his other arm in almost the exact same spot. We are learning from the doctors that he most likely has some type of bone disease that makes his bones more fragile. The costs are mounting and it has become very overwhelming. My family and I love this dog to the moon and back x1000 and we want to be able to afford the best options for him. Thank you for any contribution possible.

Help for Ziggy,"$1,050 ","$1,500 ",Animals," September 21, 2016",8,3,LANCASTER,SC,77000,,,"

                                                            on behalf of Ashley Schlegel

LANCASTER, SC                                





                        I am doing this for my daughter Ashley Schlegel and for her puppy Ziggy. Ziggy is an amazingly sweet 7-1/2 month old Great Pyrenees that she has had since she was 9 weeks old and has known almost since she was born. Ziggygot a mysterious wound on her leg the end of last month. I took her to the vet and they thought it was a snake bite, but a month has gone by and there's been no improvement. The swelling now covers a large portion of her leg and so they did a biopsy on it. It turns out that it's not a snake bite at all, but a very serious and rare fungal infection called Pythiosis. They have given her three options 1, a treatment of the fungal infection would require surgery and months of laser therapy which would cost several thousand dollars, 2, Euthanasia, which she is not even considering with her being just under 8 months old and not to mention she really loves this dog, and 3. Amputation of the leg, which is still going to cost between $800 and $1000 plus follow up care. I'm asking for any thoughts, prayers, help, and advice that we can get to help Ziggy. Ashley is a very hard working young lady that is supporting herself and her animals and she has already spent about $500.00 on all of the testing and antibiotics that they have already tried. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated and any extra recevied over her costs would be donated to help other animals.

MOUNT SAINT FRANCIS, IN                                




YES - THIS IS A TRUE STORY! HELP FIGHT GOVERNMENTAL ABUSE ANDHELP REBUILD ANIMAL SANCTUARY!THIS IS A BRUTAL, SCARY REAL LIVE NIGHTMARE!Katherine Fraze, The Indiana Multi - Species Rescuer, needs help so she can reclaim her wrongly seized property, rebuild after a Spring fire and continue her rescue work. For the LONG story, go to our facebook group page and dive in. Join if you like.Donate if you can. Share if you will.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/1077037325679122/Since 1993, Katherine has owned this incredible, secluded 130 acres in Floyd County, Indiana that she aptly named The Sanctuary. Since 1998, she has happily and healthily lived there in an RV, without running water but with electricity and one heck of a view!  https://www.facebook.com/TheAnimalSanctuaryofIndiana/photos/a.1717814238468445.1073741828.1715068052076397/1733367243579811/?type=3&theater THE BRUTAL, SCARY PART BEGINS NOW WITH THE ACTIONS OF FLOYD COUNTY, INDIANA HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND NE W ALBANY ANIMAL CONTROL EMPLOYEES CONSPIRING TOGETHERAGAINST KATHERINE FRAZE AND SAVE THAT DOG SANCTUARY:In 2010, Floyd County Health Department and Animal Control tried to retroactively impose their 2006 Floyd County statutes on Katherine Fraze despite the fact that Katherine had been living in Floyd County since 1998 (""Grandfathered In"", as they say), and despite the fact that she was given a STAY in February 2010 to remain on her property, in an RV with all of her 40 dogs, both the health department and animal control continue to spend our tax dollars to violate, bankrupt and harass Katherine, her animals and her property to this day.In March, 2016 there was a devastating fire at The Sanctuary. Her plan was to simply camp on her 130 acres until things were figured out.ALL SHE HAD LEFT WERE THE CLOTHES ON HER BACK.ALL OF HER BIRDS WERE KILLED.THE DOGS WERE WITH KATHERINE, SAFE.THE CLEAN UP IS STILL IN PROGRESS. IT'S SLOW.PAINFUL. EVERYTHING, GONE. https://www.facebook.com/katherine.fraze/media_set?set=a.1187387454605352.1073741950.100000023251919&type=3On Friday, April 1, 2016, the local sheriff shows up at 8am to Katherine's property and ""gives"" her ""1 hour to completely vacate"", the land still smoldering from everything lost in the March 22 fire - yet he's here to evict her for not having a septic system? The sheriff said that if she stepped one foot back on the property, he was going to arrest and jail her. He said, ""We don't want you here. The judge is sick of you and so am I."" Katherine Fraze has been singled out and wrongly evicted from her 130 acre Sanctuary for NOT putting in a septic system for her non permanent structure, the RV. It's in Floyd County's own statutes, yet here we are. Her living arrangement was approved by Floyd County Planning & Zoning in 1998 when they gave her a permit to install electricity.The county ordinances actually allow Katherine to come back onto her property after an Act of God, like the fire, and the statutes give her up to one year to resettle in the same sort of arrangement, i.e., an RV.But the county refuses to allow Katherine the same rights as her neighbors in Floyd County.Today, Katherine Fraze is living in her van, forced into homelessness and now poverty because of the 6+ years of malfeasance by certain county agencies and their rogue employees determined to force her off her 130 heavenly Sanctuary in Floyd County, Indiana. Don't ask us why because only they know what their end game is as they continue their vendetta against Katherine and Save That Dog Sanctuary of Indiana for almost 84 months.As everyone who reads the long version at the Justice For RESCUER Katherine Fraze on facebook says, ""SOMEBODY WANTS YOUR 130 ACRES...!"" and it sure seems to be true. But who?Floyd County, I do believe, IS the smallest county in Indiana and allthat tax revenue they're losing because Katherine won't develop her unique land. (Just so you know, Katherine has a Conservation Easement in place so even if they murder her, The Sanctuary will live on forever, despite Floyd County's attempts otherwise!)Our goal here is BEFORE WINTER we create an office space for Katherine at The Sanctuary, since she's allowed to VISIT her property but not ""live there"".  Nothing big or fancy. Getting electricity back on. Some lights. Maybe some shelves. A chair.Walling up an existing carport seems easy and the most feasible; legally, and financially.This most fundamental shelter means Katherine has a safe place even in bad weather.We need your help to do it! Until we do this, she lives in her van with her 4 dogs at the Kroger parking lot or the truck stop, returning to her property every day.WHAT WE NEED TO PREP FOR WINTER SHELTER:*Plywood and worker to wall up and floor carport.*Insulate it.*Electrician to hook power back up.*Generator.*5 gallon cans for gasoline.*Good portable heaters.*Firewood.*Water tank.             ****************************THE NEW ALBANY - FLOYD COUNTY, INDIANA ANIMAL CONTROL PART OF THIS SCARY STORY:Katherine Fraze has been once again singled out and wrongly ordered to limit her rescue work to 4 dogs only on her 130 acre secluded Sanctuary, though she COULD have 120 cattle...or 85 pigs... ANY number of ANY other species but no more than 4 DOGS.THE JUDGE SAID IF KATHERINE HAS ANY MORE THAN FOUR DOGS, HE WILL ORDER ANIMAL CONTROL TO KILL THEM. How is that right? Or just? It's meant to be mean. It's meant to traumatize and terrorize Katherine Fraze and her animals.There's no Law or Statute to back up the judge's threat. They just make up Law where Katherine is concerned.It's most certainly NOT because of neglect or cruelty since Katherine takes great care of her animals.IT'S BECAUSE THE NAME OF HER NON PROFIT IS SAVE THAT DOG SANCTUARY OF INDIANA.After killing over 30 of Katherine's dogs in 2010, the 4 dog limit by animal control also killed her non -profit. It's like the COUNTY are the vicious animals, attacking, ripping and bloodying Katherine any way they can come up with, legal or not.THIS IS CALLED ""SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT"".""DISCRIMINATION"".""TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE"".""INTENT TO HARM"".THIS IS CALLED ""VIOLATING KATHERINE'S 4th AND 14th Amendments to our CONSTITUTION"".Ask yourself, now that you've read this:""What would I have done? What would I do now?"" Just remember that Katherine Fraze has rescued over 1,000 animals; mostly dogs but with plenty of birds, cats, pigs, a human here or there and a variety of wildlife thrown into the mix.  She works closely with her longtime Veterinarian who is adept at multi species treatment and care. Katherine's work as a facilitator for Animal Assisted Therapy visits is well respected by all who experience it. High risk foster girls are especially close to Katherine's heart:""I was impressed by the girls as they got to know Katherine's dogs; relating their feelings to her about pets that they had. This allowed the girls to start processing any sadness or grief that they were feeling. They were able to connect to happier times in their lives, moments in their past where an animal they loved was present. I noted how certain personalities of individual girls connected with certain personalities of Save That Dog Sanctuary's dogs. At first, some of the girls were fearful or hesitant but gradually they allowed themselves to trust the dogs as they might in human interaction. I enjoyed watching the girls nurture the animals, showing them kindness and gentleness as Katherine's dogs won them over.""--Kelly Hudgins, Maryhurst Treatment Coordinator       ****************************************I can tell you here and now: I believe that Katherine deserves our support because she has refused to be ganged up on and is literally standing her ground.Katherine Fraze is smart, fearless, open minded and proactive. She is always willing to help, without a lot of judgment andI have personally seen her do some amazing things with no expectation of reward, or donation, just a promise to always call her if you think she can help.Her rescue work has helped so many, including me.She is an advocate not just for animals, but for thepeople who love them, too.  I hope you'll help us support Katherine's and share her story. Even if you don't donate, please keep her in your prayers.As Katherine's longtime friend and supporter, thank you for your time.Whitney BotkinsBei Capelli SalonNerium, International

                        Bella story begins with a trip to her doctor with what appears to be a torn ACL . However , as the days progressed her leg became severely swollen and painful . Unsure as to what was going on X-rays indicated soft tissue swelling . She was placed on antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications and biopsy was scheduled the following week . The day before her biopsy we ended up in emergency hospital in Wilmington NC . She was given more medication and Sub-q fluids . Monday came and we went to her scheduled biopsy and her doctor felt instead we should take her to NC State Veterinary Hospital in Raleigh, NC . We took her directly there and she was admitted . After multiple testing on Bella it was decided to transfer her to Oncology then to surgical . We were advised that she would need her leg amputated and the minimum deposit would be $5000.00 Bella will need lots of care in the future with chemo expenses and I'm hoping that setting up the page will help . So far we are close to $7000 out of pocket . Her chest xray and vital organ ultrasounds have shown no masses . We will continue to make trips to State every 3 weeks for 18 weeks to finish chemo . Please keep our girl in your prayers .

                        If you know me, than you know that Remy means the absolute world to me. Remy started having seizures in September so we got her on medication for that. Everything was going ok until I had to up her dose because of the ongoing seizures. Another few months went by and she did better. On March 14th Remy had four seizures in less than 24 hours. I couldn't keep her out of my site and every day seemed to get worse. Losing balance, not having any energy, not acknowledging me when I would talk to her and at times losing her site.  One night after work, I walked in the door and no one stumbled around the corner to meet me. Remy was on my bed and couldn't seem to get up. She started to have cluster seizures and then had a full blown seizure which lasted a good while. I knew if this didn't change that I was going to have to make an extremely hard decision. I could not imagine my life without this brat!!Luckily we got her on new medication that has made things better. The doctor believes that she may have a brain tumor but she needs to see a specialist to figure out where it is and how severe it isSo because I would do anything for Remy, I'm going to set my pride to the side for a moment and ask for any donations that you may be willing to give towards her medical expenses.

Have you heard? Its official! Friends of Sangamon County Animal Control now includes a rescue and foster program.Friends of Sangamon County Animal Control has become a rescue. We are now able to place animals from Sangamon County Animal Control into our approved foster homes. Meet Violet and Rosie. They are the first two SCACAC dogs that Friends of SCACAC Rescue officially pulled from SCACAC. We have already had our first adoption when Violet found her forever home and little Rosie is healing well in one of our approved foster homes. As Friends Rescue becomes more involved in rescuing shelter animals we are finding that there is equipment and supplies that we will need. Our rescue wish list includes portable kennels, food, funds for medical intervention and transport costs. We are hoping that this Go Fund Me plea will help us acquire this equipment and supplies. This funding will help to purchase 2-3 portable kennels, assist with veterinarian fees and provide gas for transporting our pets to forever homes or safe shelters. We would be so grateful if you would help our rescue grow by donating to our wish list. Volunteered staffed, 100% of all money goes to the animals.

                        When Ryan, a science teacher at Oceana High School, told his classes of what happened to Oda, his dog, he was onverge of tears- so was much of the class.On Wednesday, the 5th of January, Ryan's dog Oda was hit by an automobile near Fort Funston. Oda suffered many injuries; she sustained three fractures in her pelvis and cannot currently walk without any assistance. In Ryan's explanation of what happened, he also mentioned the steep, steep costs of surgery and veterinary services. The surgery was $8,000, the x-ray $2,000, and other fees around $3,000, totaling $13,000. Ryan put it simply: he just didn't have that kind of money. He's going ahead with the surgery anyway, however. There is just no way Ryan could put Oda, whom he loves so much, to sleep.You see, Oda is very dear to him, and Ryan is dear to Oceana students. That's why we're collecting donations to help Ryan cover the costs of medical procedures for his beloved dog, Oda. Anything would help: $1, $2, whatever you can afford to give. It would mean so much to us, Ryan, and Oda. Thanks from the students at Oceana High School

                        We started the week off with a hit and run that left our car undriveable...ok...we'll get through this. We can pay our deductible and hope for a rental car. Things could be worse...Our oldest boxer, Hades, has recently been losing too much weight and has had no interest in his food. He will only eat the good stuff...the rolls of grain free goodness...the soft, chunky cans of yumminess...this food adds up way more than his normal hard food. We took him for a checkup and found he is having thyroid issues...still waiting for results... hoping to rule out cancer...But wait, there's more...Our sweet little Luna lives for anything round and squeaky. She lives for playing. She lives for jumping. She lives for sunshine. She lives for running in the grass. Last night, 9/23/16, her back leg went limp. It was scraping along the ground as she walked, it progressed to lots of crying and an inability to get comfortable. We went to the 24-hour vet. After pain meds and x-rays, there are no fractures and no out-of-socket hips. This was neurological... this will either get better or it just won't. If it is degenerative, she will eventually need a cart or rear harness. She is barely over a year old.When it rains, it pours. So many of us work hard every day just to barely get by. We make it work. We tackle the issue at hand and move on. But when it's one major expense after another and there are no savings to turn to, what can we do? We put our pride in the backseat and ask for help. It is hard for us to ask for help, we know everyone is on hard times... For us, to reach out in this way, it's a desperate plea for help... and we will always pay it forward.Playing is what Luna lives for. She would do anything just for a toy. Treats don't even get her attention more than a good ball or a squeaky. Now, she can't even run or potty without falling over.This is Hades. He's healthy when he is about 75 pounds. He weighs 57 right now. Fingers crossed its not the dreaded 'c' word.

                        Casper's FB family, we need your help! The very recent develpements with Apollo'semergency surgery ANDthe need to have a tumor removed from Caspers back leg all coming on the same weekend has crippled us financially. Though we are greatful for the doctors that are helping both Apollo and Casper it is amazing the financial costs that they require for little or no answers until after the the surgeries. I wisheveryone could experience the joy these to dogs share with us and each other every day. As Casper's family, we try very hard to share with everyone the growth and change that casper has had since we were so fortunate to have adopted him through his FB page but it can never really share the whole story. the events of this weekend were crushing and It would be devistating to both of them to lose the other right now and equally devistating for our family. The costs are tremendous and we are footing the entire bill right now that will exceed 10k for both dogs. Some may say that people arecrazy to spend that kind of money on a dog but it seems cruel not to if you can help them.Apollo is still not out of the woods but doing better...Casper's surgery will bescheduled for this week...Anything that you can do to help offset some the costs for their care would be greatly appreciated! Anything that may be possibly left over will be donated to local animal rescues here in the Idaho! We thank you so much for your continued prayers and support for our family and these two amazing creatures!

                        This morning, Sunday August 7, 2016, we had to rush our puppy Rook to the emergency vet with severe diarreah and vomiting.Upon arrival the vet ran a parvo test and subsequently ran another both of which came back negative. We're still trying to figure out what's wrong. His white blood cell count is currently 450 and the vet fears his prognosis isn't good. Due to some issues on the farm and vet bills, including this one, our savings is tapped out. Rook needs to stay at the vet until further notice. He's currently at the Pet Emergency Center but we'll be moving him to another vet for continued care.  I'll post where he's been moved to when that's decided.If you can help us, even just a little, we'd be very grateful. Thank you in advance.

                                                As some of you know, our beloved Raider is a cancer survivor. At age 7 he was diagnosed with a rare cancer. After successful surgery and 4 rounds of chemotherapy, Stacey and I were able to save him. Four years later, here we are again with a different form of cancer in one of his lungs. Thankfully, his vet and oncologist feel with surgery he has more quality life ahead of him. We are not ready to give up on our little guy. He's been such a happy and important part of our lives. Raider needs the surgery in the next two weeks to have a chance. Stacey and I didn't want to go this route but we are running out of options. Any help for Raider's fight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to listen.

                            Rachel Campbell
                            
                            
                                                           
LANDIS, NC                                





                        About me:   My name is Rachel Campbell, and I am a 16 year-old Junior Handler in the Max Fast Flyball Club in Charlotte, NC. (Region 9 of NAFA.) My dog Akela and I have been participating in flyball tournaments for over a year now, and both she and I have grown to LOVE flyball.    There is only one problem: finances. Several years ago, my mother (the only parent involved in my life) became deathly ill and almost passed away. Through doctors care, lifestyle changes (including going out of work - teaching school - and being placed on disability with the school system), and time to heal, she has recovered a great deal. To this day, however, her health remains very unstable/unpredictable. She has now transitioned to receiving only her retirement income (which is LESS). She has applied for Social Security disability to supplement her retirement income since she is unable to work, but it is still pending. For that reason our family still faces many financial struggles in just trying to meet regular living expenses.   You may wonder what a sixteen year-old girl whose family is experiencing such hardships is doing having a dog and participating in flyball. My answer is FOCUS. When ones life is falling apart, it really helps to have a positive, healthy hobby to focus on to keep from crumbling under the stress. My dog and our activities got me through some VERY tough times.   I HAVE been doing several things to raise money to help our family and to pay my flyball expenses. First of all, I have a knack for working with animals, especially dogs, which led me to create my own dog-training business. I currently have 9 full-time customers, and meet new prospects continually. In addition to dog training, I started my own business, Tail Wagging Tugs, in which I make fleece tugs and leashes. (Please check out my website:  www.Tailwaggintugs.com) I am now able to create 8 different types of braids, and I create custom-designed tugs and leashes - designed by the customers - for no extra charge. Although I just started my business in February of this year (2016), I have already sold over 160 items and have customers in 11states and in 1 foreign country! By vending at flyball tournaments, I raise money to pay my tournament entry fees, camping fees, gasoline costs, food money, etc.  What I'm Trying To Raise Money For: My dream is to go to the CanAm Classic Flyball tournament in Indianapolis, Indiana, on October 7th - 9th 2016. It is the world's largest Flyball tournament, with people coming from Canada, Alaska, Japan, Australia, and other places to compete. Most tournaments only have 1-2 rings for racing, but this tournament has 7! I have never been to this tournament before, and it is my dream to go.  I have calculated and listed here the costs involved for my dog and I to be able to participate in this fabulous tournament. Racing Fees-$150.00, Thursday - Sunday night stay at Red Roof Inn at Indianapolis-$310.00, Human food for 5 days (3 people)-$150.00, Dog food for 5 days-$25.00, Dog Treats for Rewards- $20.00, Gasoline to get us there and back-$200.00, Dog Pen to place my dog in when we are not racing- $75.00 Oil Change for Our Vehicle- $35.00 and lastly, the fees that will be taken out of the donations by GoFundMe equal $26.54. The Grand Total is $965.00+$26.54.  This rounds off to $992.00. This means so much to me because, as I stated earlier, when ones life is falling apart, it really helps to have a positive, healthy hobby to focus on to keep from crumbling under the stress. All of the money raised by this campaign will be used for the purposes listed above, and no unrelated purposes. I will need the funds by early October. Thank you so much for reading this and for your donation, no matter what size. If you have friends or family members whom you think might be willing to help me with a small donation, please ask them to read my Go Fund Me article. Every little bit helps move me closer to a dream come true! Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart,Rachel

                        Rowdy could not have a more fitting name. He is a wild, goofy boy that is always having fun and getting laughs out of us with his crazy antics. Unfortunatly, this time his antics got him into trouble.Sometime Friday night (May 6th), Rowdy ingested parts of a rubber toy that he had thoroughly ripped to bits. Saturday morning, it was apparent that something was not right, and he might be in danger. He was sluggish, not eating and had thrown up only peices of the toy; all signs that he had a blockage. He was rushed to the vet, where after xrays and observation they confirmed oursuspicions. Rowdy had a blockage that would require surgery to remove, or he would die.The final total for the surgery was going to be a jaw dropping $915. But Rowdy is so young and full of life, we could not just give up on him. He underwent the surgery, and is now in recovery. It's a huge relief that Rowdy has pulled through his ordeal, but now a new stress is setteling in...where will we get the funds to cover his surgery?Already being way over our budget on vet care, we are desperatly trying to scrape together funds to offset the cost of this huge blow to our already meager funds. We would so greatly appriciate any donations, anything helps!

                        Hi everyone,I am writing this for Jessica, because I don't think she would do this for herself.As most of you know Jessica's little furry baby, Sissy, was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer. After a CT scan and discussions with doctors it looks like surgery is her best option. The surgery will cost about $5,000 which is not easy to afford, but worth it to give Sissy some more happy years with Jessica.Anyone that knows Jessica will understand just what Sissy means to her. Sissy is Jessica's daughter, her companion, her best friend, and anyone who has ever met Sissy can understand why. Sissy is the sweetest little fur baby you could ever meet. She behaves more like a person than a dog. She's full of love and life, and you wouldn't even know she has cancer by watching her run outside to chase birds.Jessica would feel like she was imposing on everyone by asking for help, but I know she has so many friends and family out there that love her, and love her Sissy. Jessica is such a caring and giving person that has helped so many people throughout her life, and I believe many of us would jump at any opportunity to help her out.Please consider donating whatever you can spare, even a single dollar from everyone would be so helpful and greatly appreciated. If you are unable to donate money, Jessica would love your thoughts and prayers through this tough time.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance for your support!Sincerely,Billy

This has been a long, difficult year for Feathered Hearts Avian Rescue. We have been continualy inundated with birds, with little to no adoptions. We have spent thousands on vet care and food. Without anyone adopting, we have no way to recoup our losses. We have been using our personal funds to keep the rescue afloat. All donations are tax deductable as we are a 501C3 rescue. Please help us continue to help our feathere friends. We are close to having to close our doors, and as we are the only avian rescue in Vermont and the immediate area, we would hate for it to come to this. Thank you for your support.

DOVER, DE                                





                        What we thought was just a cold, turned into a life threatening disease.Lucy Lu is a German shepherd and she's only 14 months old. She was the happiest, energetic, and loveable puppy out there. Then one day, she turned lethargic, sad, and distant. She would not touch her food, get up from her bed, or even perk her ears up when we said, ""Do you want to go for a car ride? We knew something was not right, so we took our first trip to the vet on 7/20/16. All of her symptoms (limping, lethargy, high fever, and loss of appetite) pointed to lymes disease, and heartworms. Her blood was tested for not only those two diseases, but also it was tested for several others as well and they all came back negative. Leaving us and the vet with a big question mark, the vet put her on a wide spectrum ofantibiotics and pain medication to help make her more comfortable and thinking that this could just be a cold. With no signs of improvement and her symptoms getting significantly worse we took her to the ER on 7/23/16. They could not find the root cause either and was only able to see discomfort in one of her paws. They subscribed her with another pain medication and just gave us another question mark on what could be wrong with her.On Monday morning 7/25/16 we woke up to three of her paws being swollen, and her symptoms only getting worse. She was now constantly sleeping would not lift her head, and raising her teeth every time we tried to touch her paws. Obviously, she was in so much pain. We then took another trip to the vet. They had never seen anything like what she had developed so they referred us to a specialist. We drove for about an hour, and admitted her into the ER there. It took hours, but we were finally seen. They decided she needed to be hospitalized because she still had a fever and was in extreme pain. The next morning I received a call that she had been sent over to the Internal Medicine department and they started running tests on her. The doctor gave me a number of possibilities on what she could have and none of them were good. After further testing and taking fluid from her joints they diagnosed her with IMPA (Immune-Mediated Polyarthropathy). This is where her immune system attacks her joint linings, explaining her extreme pain to walk and the swelling of her paws. He then started her on steroids to begin to treat this disease and was hoping she would be able to go home with us the next day.On Wednesday 7/27/16 they called with bad news, her blood cell count dropped from a 36% to a 27%. She was then diagnosed with IMHA (Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia) this is when her immune system is mistaking her red blood cells for something toxic and it attacks them. This disease only has a 30-50% survival rate. We were heartbroken.The doctor started her on more aggressive steroids to suppress her immune system so it would stop attacking her body. The next day we got a call saying that her red blood cell count increased 7%. This meant that her body was responding to her medication, which is great news. The doctor told us since she was responding positively; we were able to bring her home. We were the happiest people in the world to be able to have our baby home again.However, we were left with a hefty bill of $4,262 not including her medication she has to be on. That is another $400 a month just on medication alone. And the vet bills from the beginning were $500. Nick is serving in the United States Air Force currently but is separating in October to go back to school. I am currently working a part-time job and attending college as well. We had to take a great amount of our savings to pay for this vet bill and its not over yet. She will have multiple visits a month with the specialist and blood testing done during those visits for the first few months. The visits will decrease and her medication might as well but that will not be for another year. Asking for money is not something we enjoy doing, but we have no other choice. We have a goal to raise $4,000 to go towards Lucy Lu's vet bill, medication, and future vet bills and treatment. Anything that is donated beyond our goal will be given to research to try to keep others from going through what we would have to go through. Every little bit counts and we are nothing but grateful. If you cannot donate, a simple prayer, wish, or kind thought will go a long way as well. Thank you all so much for reading and staying by our side through this emotional time.There will be daily/weekly updates on my facebook page if you guys would like to follow her story any further.Sincerely,Nick, Shelby, and Lucy Lu

                        Monticello Paws for Parks is a local group working under the direction of the Monticello Parks Commission to raise funds to develop the city of Monticello's first ever off-leash dog park! The City's SupportBased upon a recommendation from the Monticello Parks Commission and City staff, the City Council authorized setting aside a portion of Meadow Oak Park to be used as a future off-leash dog park. This is approximately 2 acres of open green space and a shaded area with oak trees. With the land now secured, funding is needed to fence in and develop the park.The SiteThe site is located in the Meadow Oak Development on the east end of the city of Monticello, Minnesota. The park is off of Meadow Oak Drive and County Road 75 near the old eastbound freeway frontage road entrance. The site is ideal for many reasons including: The City's pathway system runs along the property The park is lighted along the pathway A paved parking lot is nearby within walking distance A crosswalk is planned from the parking lot to the park A dock may be installed at the pond area for splash playImprovement CostsThe initial start-up costs for the park are estimated at $20,000.

                        **** SECOND UPDATE ****At 6am this morning I received a phone call from Baileys vet. He passed away in their care overnight. All funds donated to this campaign will go towards the remaining hospital bills, a necropsy and getting his body cremated. **** UPDATE ****Bailey is now being kept overnight at the Exotics hospital. He is on IV fluids. X rays show he may have liver torsion, which, without surgery, will kill him. He is extremely anemic and pale. His intestines are full of gas. PLEASE donate what you can even if it's $1. The vet said he may pass away overnight. Please send healing energy his way. Hello! My name is Nicole Vazquez and I am the owner of a five year old holland lop rabbit named Bailey.I am disabled and live on SSD, so money is extremely tight for me at the moment.However Bailey is sick and needs emergency medical care. I woke up this morning to him not being responsive, hunched up in a ball in pain, refusing food, treats and water. His stomach is swollen and hard, and his ears are cold.I'm extremely worried about my rabbit. I already lost his older brother last year due to an unsuspected heart attack. I'm not mentally ready to lose the only pet I have left.Your help is greatly appreciated, and ANY contribution, even $1, will help with transportation and getting us the help he needs as soon as possible.He's never had any medical issues, so I'm not sure if it's stasis or bloat, or something else.Initial fee for emergency servies at the exotics vet here in NYC is $150 up front. I can't take him to the vet unless I at least have that much.ThenI will need help paying anyadditional costs for testing and any medication he may need.I'm desperate for help at this point. He is my baby and if I can't get him medical attention ASAP I'm afraid I may lose him.

Archimedes Needs Help Brain Surgery,"$2,085 ","$10,000 ",Animals," September 4, 2016",27,20,ANTIOCH,CA,183000,,3,"

ANTIOCH, CA                                





                        We are the Henderson Family and we recently went through a rough spot with our 3 year old American Masstiff Archimedes. Archimedes one day started to have seizures so we took him to the emergency and after 4 days in the hospital at UC Davis, they found a brain tumor. He went through a round of medication to knock down the inflamation around the tumor and get the seizures to stop and we thought we had the thing under control. We just took him to re visit his doctor and she told us she had his scans sent to a neurologist in New York and the news was not good. The neurologist think we should have the tumor removed as soon as possible because of where it is located and if we wait too long, it may grow to an in operable size. It is located in the front of his brain where it could affect his personality.For those that know our big goofy boy, he is just that. A loveable snuggle bear who loves everyone. The last thing we could bear is for this tumor to change his loveable personality and we lose the family member we have grown to love. We also have a 4 month old new daughter who has grown quite attached to her puppy. She loves to snuggle with him and bury her face in his neck fluff. Archimedes has grown quite fond of her as well and doesn't move an inch when she is hugging him. As big as he is, he is so gentle with his tiny human. He follows her everywhere and gets concerned when she cries. We can't risk the possible change in his personality which may make him aggressive towards anyone or anything. We also want him to grow old with our daughter. The only option is brain surgery and because of his size, it is very expensive. We would love to keep our big boy around for a long life to grow up with our daughter and we would appreciate any help from the people who know Archimedes and would love to see him stick around.Our family would be very grateful to anyone who is willing to help keep our little group together in anyway. The money would be used to cover the cost of his surgery and medication for the few months afterwards.Anyone who donates will get a personal thank you card fromArchimedes with his sgnature paw print and an update after surgery. Thank you so much to all who help.Archie and the Hendersons

                        This is Buster. I rescued him in September 2012, from a very abusive situation. When he came to me, he was 2 years old, had been through two owners (I am his third and last), and had been abused leaving him with a back injury and several scars. He was severely malnourished, weighing only 50 some pounds, infested with fleas, and had open wounds from where bigger, more aggressive dogs, living in the same unit, attacked him. He was a hot mess for sure! When he came to me, he barely knew the command to ""sit"".But here we are, almost 4 years later. It hasn't been easy, but it has been an adventure!! He's been a wonderful friend and companion. He has learned so much as he is so stinking smart! But, one week ago, Buster was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer, as well as a mass in his abdomen, and my world crashed in on itself. The vet, while wonderful to work with, has said there's nothing that can be done to save his life. I can only do my best, to make him comfortable and shower him with unconditional love. The vet has put him on pain meds, three times a day, and steroids, twice a day. We tried weaning him off the steroids, but that only caused his condition to worsen, temporarily. So it's back to twice a day for the prednisone. I've also taken him off all processed foods as this causes problems for him. So he now eats better than me (seriously! Lol) with a brown rice, chicken, and chicken broth meal twice a day. I'm looking to raise enough funds for his care, any end of life needs that may be needed, as well as crematory services afterwards. I am on disability, and live alone, with Buster and two cats (one of which ex I rescued 3 days before my back surgery in 2015), so things are very tight financially. I feel I should also mention that I'm also recovering from a patella tendon reconstruction knee surgery, and can not drive as it is the right knee. So I need to rely on friends for help with transportation to and from the vet. It would be awesome to be able to give them a few dollars for gas. Should I raise more money than my needs require, I will donate the excess to a rescue or someone else going through a similar situation. I have always practiced the ""pay it forward"" attitude. If you can only spare $1.00, it would be very appreciated! If anyone understands a tight budget, it's me. So, that's just a brief story of this amazing, loving dog who touches the heart of all who get to meet him! I thank you for your time and wish you a blessed day full of love, hugs, fur baby kisses!

They will need to take blood samples and do other test. Blood work cost around 100$ I'm on a very small tight income so I'm begging. This dog is not just a dog. To me she is a child. I'm not asking, I'm begging. I lost my best friend of 9 years (my first doggy love, Zoey) and was unable to help her because her life was taken too fast. But with Gigi I feel this is an early detection and I just cannot lose her! Any contribution of any size is much appreciated. Thank you so much. Please share my GoFundMe in hopes we can reach this goal to save my baby from being wheelchair bound and paralysed for life or worse. She is all up to date on her shots and vaccines and her license. This is not a hand out, it is help to rescue her from suffering . My baby girl is only 2 will be 3 in October. She is too young do have to deal with this.

                        Hi everyone!Thanks for visiting my page. I'm raising money to get a labradoodle puppy that I can train as a therapy dog (reasons and my story are below). Labradoodle puppies cost about $2000, and I can only contribute about $500. I am trying to save EVERYTHING I possibly can right now, but am asking for some help.So, why am I doing this? I have kind of an intense story... you know, ""one of those"" stories. I grew up as a teenager in Uganda, where the value of living my life in the service of others was instilled on me. I worked with youth who had survived horrible rebel warfare, all the while dealing with severe abuse from my classmates amongst other severe traumas.I have major, complex PTSD due to severe abuse and trauma that occurred from ages 2-18 at the hands of multiple people (not my parents!). I'm working hard at life, and in therapy, but I struggle to ""ground"" myself sometimes, and I struggle to find hope. My therapist and friends have recommended that I find a dog that I can train to be a therapy aid. PTSD service dogs are trained to wake you up from nightmares, help you ground at hard times, and help with physical and mental health. Of course, because of the financial constraints, I have tried adopting not one, but two different dogs, and unfortunately they were both aggressive.Various places do train PTSD service dogs, however, they are usually only offered to veterans. For that reason, I'm not able to get one at a low/free cost. Pre-trained PTSD service dogs cost between $8000 and $20000 for civilians, which means that getting a trainable puppy and training it is my best option.Labradoodles are so easy to train, they are smart, and have the right personality to be a therapy dog/PTSD service dog. I know how and where I would train the puppy to be a service dog, and can do so relatively inexpensively. That means that the biggest cost is getting a puppy. I so desperately want a dog that I can train to be helpfulf for me, and eventually for others, but I cannot afford one on my own. If you are able to spare even a dollar to help me get a puppy, I would be so very very grateful!At this point, it's a daily battle to stay grounded and present, and a therapy dog would help SO MUCH. If you can help, I would greatly appreciate it!

With lots of treats and a little patience, Beauty seems open to affection and is actually learning to love belly rubs. Still no aggressive tendencies have been shown whatsoever. Beauty does need to be carried since she doesnt yet know how to walk on a leash, but we think Beauty will be just fine in a home that teaches her the how-tos of daily life.

Even though she started off as a shelter dog in South America, she fit right into her new home in Winthrop and brought more joy to her owners lives than any dog possibly could. She is the most loving, silly and personable dog there could be!About a year ago, Harlee beat cancer and toughed out it with the coolest pink cast ever during her recovery. Unfortunately right now her spleen is in very bad condition and she needs emergency surgery to have it removed or she will die.One of her owners, Nikki, is a dedicated vet tech who will do anything to help ANY dog- but will go as far as selling everything and anything she has to make sure her dog gets the proper treatment. For all Nikki does, please help back by giving to her dogs surgery, that is very necessary for her survival. Harlee and her family would be so very grateful for even a share of this post.

ENTERPRISE, AL                                




Big Bend Wildlife Sanctuary Inc. (BBWS) is a 501.c.3 nonprofit organization dedicated to the care of orphaned, sick, abandoned, and injured wildlife and to the education of people regarding wildlife. We believe that all wildlife deserves a second chance and our goal is to help wildlife get back on their feet and be released back to the wild once they are ready. Many of these animals are in our care for months and even years before they can be released. In order for BBWS to give them the best chances at release, we need to provide them with the appropriate care. They not only needgood medical care, they need good nutrition, appropriate housing, beddingandvolunteers to provide the appropriate care. We also educate the public about their wild neighbors and try to teach them how to live cohesively with them. We have learned that most negative issues involving wildlife, are a result of the public not understanding the various species and that results in fear and dislike. We try to debunk the old myths about wildlife and share why it is so important to appreciate and protect them. Fear is a powerful feeling and often results in injury or death to wildlife.As a tool for educating the public we have a few nonreleaseable animals that are our ambassadors for wildlife rehabilitation. These animals have been shot and may be missing a wing or they may have been raised as a pet and are too imprinted on humans to survive in the wild. We have special permits to have these animals and they help us to clear up the misconceptions many people have of them. These animals are also a big expense for BBWS. They also require special care, housing, food and medical care that is on going. Some of these animals will be in our care for possibly 20 - 30 years. Those expenses also add up fast.BBWS values the life of every animal that comes through our doors. Over 70% of those that are admitted are because ofhumans in some way. It may be that their dog or catinjured a wild mammal, reptile or bird; or it could be that a wild animal flew intotheir vehicles while chasing their food across the road. There are also times when humans are just cruel and have no compassion for the animal and either uses it for target practice or simply torments the animal. No matter what the reason we feel it our responsibility to care for these animals in need and give them their second chance they deserve. When BBWS opened our doors in Alabama in 2012 we thought we would be helping a couple hundred animals, at the most, each year. But the need for a rehabilitation facility was far greater than we could ever imagine. In 2012 there were 140 animals admitted; in 2013 there were 430 admitted and in 2014 we exceeded 800 animals admitted for care. This year we will hit even higher numbers but the funds are just not there and we cannot continue to give these animals what they need without the funds.It cost us over $35,000 last year and we just can't do it alone. When the number of admitted animals goes up the need for new enclosures, food, medical treatments and surgeries, medical,and cleaning supplies, utility expenses, bedding, enrichment, maintenance, equipmentand a lot of miscellaneous expense goes up.We need your help to keep BBWS going and to provide for the ever growing need. We hope you will find our organization to be a worthy cause and contribute to help us continue our mission of providing ""2nd Chances"" to injured and orphaned native wildlife. We feel our mission is important for our wildlife and the education of the public. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Bend-Wildlife-Sanctuary-Inc/457096840991126?sk=info&tab=overview

THE REMOVER OF OBSTACLESI fostered Ganesh when he was a baby cat, and he was adopted last year by a sweet young couple named David and Rosalie when he was eight months old. On November 2nd, a fire destroyed their home (an apartment on the 18th floor of a high-rise apartment building, pictured below), and David suffered second-degree burns on his left hand. Ganesh managed to escape the fire, but he got pretty banged up, his injuries consistent with a fall. Remarkably, his wounds are not life-threatening, but he requires expensive surgeries for two broken legs (one front and one hind) and another procedure for a cracked hard palate of the mouth. The Veterinary Emergency and Referral Group of Brooklyn (VERG) took him in, and the staff there are taking incredibly good care of him. They understood the situation, and very quickly offered a grant through Positive Tails to help keep Ganesh alive. In this spirit of generosity, they began his treatment. The funds collected here will be used toward the remaining costs for Ganesh's emergency medical bills and follow-up visits during his recovery. Please give what you can or post and share this link, and become friends withGanesh on Facebook.UPDATE 12/28: $280 collected to donate directly to VERG for Ganesh. Thank you!

Quinn's Battle,$375 ,"$7,000 ",Animals," September 23, 2016",5,2,OCALA,FL,35000,2,1,"

This is Quinn, my 9month old mutt! He has had a difficult time in the last week. On September 16th, he went into surgery to remove a foreign body in his abdominal region. He had quite a bit of clothing and fabric toys suck in his small intestines and stomach. He had to have 3 incesions in his intestine and 1 incesion in his stomach. He then went to a 24 hour care to keep a close eye on him. On September 17th, a day after surgery, he became septic and had to go back into surgery. He was taken to the University of Florida Small Animal Hospital for an emergency surgery. There he had to have half of his small intestines removed due to 2 of his 4 incesions leaking.He has been in recovery for the past 5 days. He had to have a feeding tube because he has not and is still not interested in food. On September 22, his feeding tube was taken out and he is now getting nutrients through an IV because his GI system is still recovering from the surgery. He is a little fighter and my best friend. With all the care he is getting and the slow recovery, the estimate for his treatment has slowly increased to $10,000. His recovery is slow, but with the help of the doctors, we believe he will get back to normal in no time. I am not just asking for help, but asking everyone who is a pet owner to be careful with your pets, watch them, and please do not let them eat anything that is not food.

Bucks for Puck! Help fix his heart.,$750 ,"$5,000 ",Animals," September 6, 2016",10,19,BUFFALO,NY,69000,,4,"

                        Everybody meet Puck, our goofy puppy that we adopted from the Erie County SPCA on 8/13/16. On 8/25/16 Cornell University confirmed that he needed surgery to fix his heart. In medical terminology, he needs a balloon valvuloplasty to fix a bad heart valve (pulmonic stenosis). We were told he had a heart murmer, but never expected it to turn into something this serious. We also didnt think the surgery and recovery would be this expensive.Everyone that knows me, knows that I cant just ""give him back."" Puck is way too attached to Roman and I, & loves being with people. Just the thought of him going back in that kennel alone breaks my heart. So, we are trying to raise enough money to cover his surgery that is scheduled for the last week of October. Any amount will help.  Please forward this... we don't have a lot of time.

Medical Expenses for Butters,$145 ,"$7,000 ",Animals," September 6, 2016",4,19,SAN ANTONIO,TX,52000,,1,"






                            Andye Collette
                            
                            
                                                           
SAN ANTONIO, TX                                




Here is the story of our Golden Retriever, Butters. I have donated several times to gofundme accounts, but have never started one, and writing this with a heavy heart. I will start at the beginning to give you a background on our Butters.Please meet Butters Collette, our almost 4 year old Golden Retriever. Butters came into the world on September 11th, 2012 and was the runt of a litter of 10 puppies. He came home with us on October 20th. He had a very rocky beginning. Two days after he came home, he was scheduled for his vet visit, and he was not acting right. We found out that he had Parvo, a high white blood cell count, and anemia. Our vet recommended that we put him down because he was so little and sick, but we loved him so much already and could not bear to do so- he was like our child. We left him at the vet for IV treatment and other medicines, and when we were able to bring him home, spent several days bottle feeding him pedialyte to make him strong in order to bring him back to health. Well, all of the treatment and love worked! He recovered from the Parvo, which the vet said he would now be immune to, and was able to receive his shots. Fast forward to three months of age, and a trip to Petsmart, we ran across a lady who stopped to say that she had just purchased a Golden Retriever around the same age... turns out that we found Butter's sister, Molly! We both read the same Times-Picayune ad and made the journey to Ocean Springs, MS to purchase from a breeder. Butters and Molly also showed up on the same day in the Petsmart beginners puppy training class and went through 3 classes together, being led by their wonderful instructor, Gloria. Coincidentally, we learned that Molly and her family lived within close proximity to us, so we were able to go on walks together. Butters had such a personality... always stealing towels, tearing the stuffing out of toys and beds(He went through 4 stuffed beds before I stopped buying them). He loved chewing shoes, especially expensive ones! His routine with the balls would be for us to throw the ball and for him to get it and then to try and take it from him. He liked daring us to get his toys away from him... it was his game. He also loved people food and treats, of course, and would automatically sit when he knew there was a treat around. He loved people, and loved company. When the doorbell rang, he was right at the door, and sometimes it was difficult to move him away to see who was there. The cable guy usually had a hard time doing his work! Butterswas overweight for about a year or so (did I mention he loved treats?), and we had him on Hills Metabolic and Science Diet Light formulas for some time, but it did not seem to work too well. Over the last few weeks, Butters has been very sick, stopped eating pretty much all food, even people food and his treats. He has dropped a total of 20 pounds in 20days and is currently eating a small amount of Gerber baby food. His bark has changed, and he has lost all vigor. He has difficulty going on daily walks and has to go right back to the house. His once normal stool is now always runny and contains undigested food. He has been seen by his vet several times for tests and xrays, and hisx-ray showed a mediastinal mass and elevated trachea, and bloodwork done, with an elevated white count. The next step for Butters is two ultrasounds, one for the mass and one on his abdomen to determine why he is not digesting his food. UPDATE - Butters was taken to critcal care this morning under respiratory distress and will be having his ultrasounds and they will come up with a treatment plan. He will be at the facility for 24 hours for labwork and testing. His regular vet had said that if it is lymphoma, chemotherapy can help, and dogs tend to handle treatment well, and this can buy him some time. Treatment has already been very expensive, and we don't wantto give up on him. He has given us so much joy. He is not just a pet - he is part of the family and we want him around for as long as possible! We don't know what is ahead yet, but the expenses have already have been in the thousands. Thank you so much for your support, words will not express our gratitude. You can also see a history of Butters on his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/ButtersCollette/

Thanks for checking in...hereis the sad eventwhichhas ledto my financial distress. I have depleted my resources for the care of my beloved horse and here I am asking for your donations!



On Oct 6th 2011 I was taking my horse, Archie,out for a ride on a beautiful afternoon. We were heading for the powerlines so he could run through the fields to get some energy out when a guy headed straight for us,never seeing us,struck Archie'ship causing Archie to swing around90degrees. At the same time thetire was on hisfootripping off the entire hoof.I screamed at the guy with tears in my eyes as I was watching my horse shake from the tip of his ear to the base of his tail in pain,yet Archiedid everything I asked of him. As his severedfoot was bleedingallover the ground, people yelling at each other,and the sound of the fire trucks responding with sirens on, Archie stood still..on 3legs.. without moving! After the firefighters wrapped his bleeding foot, I loaded him into the trailer and off we went for a 50 minutes drive to the vetthat would be the startto ""our"" next 12 months.

Archie spent 6weeks at Rochester Equine Clinic, after making it through the initial shock and blood loss he has continuedto showa will to live. We have battled through the initial fears of infection on his exposed bone;to now overcoming afoot rotation as his new hoof starts to grow. Bandage changes initially required 3 good friends 1-2 times weekly, in middle of NE winter weather, for 40 minutes. Thank God for good friends and familywho believe inme and want to see Archiesucceed with an injury that has yet to be documented in equinehistory.As the months have gone on, Archie continues to be in good spirits, allowing the continuation of bandage changes and has now graduated to a glue on shoe for support and proper growth of his new hoof. He is on both hoof growth supplements and revascularization herbal powder to help the process. We have just finished battling an abscess in the first regenerated hoof growth. Archie now needs to grow out a second hoof in the same genetic prints of his initial hoof. Even after trauma. He continues to visit the vet every 6 weeks for multiple repeat xrays and a new shoe (approx $500-$600 each visit). Theexperts believe that, for quality of life, Archie will have to continue treatment for at least another 9 months!Although he has remained 90% stall bound, secondary to not allowing the bandage to get wet, he does enjoy a good dirt roll when permitted. I not onlylove looking out ofmy house window to see his eyes starring back at me, so full of life, butam completely committed to his recovery by spending above average time, love, andtenderness with him. I honestly believe that if it wasn't for Archie that day, Ipersonally could have been the endresult of the guy not watching where he was driving. I thank my Archie for taking the brunt of that tragic day.He ismy best friend!

Sincerely,

Tiffany and Archie

DERRY, NH                                





                        Hello! My name is Sofia. I'm autistic and seeking to raise funds to pay for service dog training. A couple years ago, I had the honor of meeting an autism service dog that wasn't my own - the dog, Bailey, and her handler were in my school for a demonstration. I was having a bad day already and Bailey had sensed that almost instantaneously. She put her head on my lap and nuzzled my hand to have me pet her. As you may expect from this story, it worked. My mother, who was sitting beside me at the time, saw all of this happening along with Bailey's handler and she was amazed to see that Bailey's help was super effective in keeping me calm. To this day, the impact that Bailey had on me personally remains unforgetable.I'm currently in the process of adopting a puppy of my own, to be trained as a service dog. After paying the adoption fees, however, I won't have the money saved to pay for the training for quite a while. This is where I need help from people like you.One-hundred percent of the donations collected will be used to pay for said service dog training. The training itself includes twelve different lessons, coverage for two different certification tests, and a vest and patches included.This means a lot to me personally. I may be a decently eloquent writer, but don't let that fool you - I have a lot of trouble with going out in public due to sensory problems. I'm thankful to have my mother by my side, but she works full time for fourty hours a week and we still make barely enough to eat sometimes. With the certification of my service dog, more independence will follow. With my dog's help, I may even be able to work soon - but he needs to be trained before I can start to better help myself to be a functioning member of society.Thank you for your time.

                        Hi, I'm Candice and I'm a senior at Mizzou! We were fortunate enough to have Tony, a loving dog, fall into our hands thismonth.Tony is anincredibly sweet 2-year-old doggie with a HUGE heart! He was not able to stay with his family because of relocationpurposes and he wound up with us for the short term to avoid taking him to a shelter. We really love having Mr. Tony around. He makes our college apartment a home and brings us so much joy!Unfortunately, weneed to pay a pet fee and monthly rent in order to keep him.If you recall from above, we're in college. AKA we are poor! We decided to take to the internet in hopes to raise enough money for Tony's pet fee so he can stay with us! We were inspired by the college football fan who raised lots of money for beerwhile tailgating. We thought saving Tony was a better cause than beer (we know some of you may not agree). However, we decided it couldn't hurt to ask, so here we are.We know there are a MILLION other wonderful causes out there to donate your hard earned money to, and we encourage you to do so! But if you have a little extra you wouldn't mind giving, it will be SO. VERY. APPRECIATED.Finally, here are some numbers and facts about animals in shelters from ASPCA:-There are about 13,600 community animal shelters nationwide. As a college town, our local shelter is packed and overpopulated-Approximately 7.6 million animals enter animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.9 million are dogs.-Of the dogs entering shelters, approximately 35% are adopted, 31% are euthanized and 26% of dogs who came in as strays are returned to their owner.* http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statisticsPlease help us keep Tony in the loving home he is currently in! We can't express to you in words how much your donation means to us. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

LEXINGTON, SC                                





                        Oliver is a 5 year old male long haired tabby cat that is full of life and love. I adopted him from my best friend in 2013 when she could no longer keep him because of school. I had just moved into an apartment by myself and he was my buddy. He is hands down the absolute best cat in the world. He has greeted me at the door every single day after I come home for the last 3 years I have had him. When you talk to him he talks back. He absolutely LOVES cuddles and being held like a baby. Whenever I feel down or I am sad, he is always there for me, sitting in my lap or next to me. On September 20th, after many months of going to different vets and trying to pinpoint a lesion that he has developed on his side, Oliver was diagnosed with Mastocytoma.  The lesion on his right side is a mast cell tumor. For about 4 months he has worn a cone or a shirt to keep from scratching it because it does bother him. He frequently is sick and vomits unless I give him Pepcid AC to reduce the stomach acid. Despite this he is still a very happy cat. His surgery is scheduled on the 27th of this month. Unfortunately, this is happening after we have bought a house and I am in the process of trying to clean up a large chunk of my debt. I think Oliver still has a really good chance at life and I am wanting to make this surgery happen so he can life the long life that he deserves. Any help is appreciated greatly. In return for any donations I can design invitations and whatnot or I can make baked goods for you. Please help me any way you can. I am not ready to let go of my baby yet. Thank you all for your time.

Help My Support Animal Get a Vest!,$50 ,$45 ,Animals," August 20, 2016",6,1,AMHERST,MA,56000,,2,"






                            Brett Bellefleur
                            
                            
                                                           
AMHERST, MA                                




Hi, my name is Brett and I'm currently going into my second year at Hampshire College! 


This past summer, I started taking care of and bonding with a new dog. His name is Boog and he's a pug who loves to kiss and cuddle, and go on adventures. I was also finally formally diagnosed with ADHD by my primary care doctor at the suggestion of my school therapist. This is the first time I've really been able to afford to see a good doctor who I felt comfortable discussing my mental health with. 


My ADHD has greatly affected my executive function (mental skills that help you get things done, and helps you manage time and pay attention) (I even had a hard time writing this - my girlfriend helped me type this out and organize my thoughts). It's also clear to people who know me well and myself that I likely have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and am on the OCD spectrum, but I still haven't been able to afford a proper therapist who can formally diagnose me with this and help me seek treatment, as the therapists at my school are not licensed to do so. 


Having Boog has really helped my ability to form a routine and manage my time. He helps calm me down and regulate my emotions. He provides a responsibility which has really helped me with controlling my symptoms this summer while living away from my childhood home and having to work, make appointments, and pay bills on my own, as I pay for all of my schooling entirely on my own. I was able to work enough to pay my college as well as take care of my dog and self, but this has become an unexpected expense due to the following experience. 


I tried to organize the certification of Boog as an ESA (Emotional Support Animal) on my college campus. To do this, I have to have a letter from a doctor or my therapist which states my need, but Disability Services at Hampshire do not allow their therapists to write such letters. I've been attempting to contact my doctor, but I have an appointment soon so I hopefully will be able to get a letter then. But the real issue arises in that the school's disability services' director has said no regardless. 


He stated that ""We do not approve ESA's for ADHD and recommend work on executive functioning skill development and other strategies to improve focus, attention and life balance.."". Despite the ADA recognizing ADHD as a debilitating behavioral disorder, due to its effect on executive function and its tendency to be comorbid with other mental disorders or learning disabilities, he absolutely refuses to do it and instead offered this as well as other ableist and classist commentary. He's done this to numerous others and Hampshire's Disability Services continuously violates the ADA. 


Because of this casual refusal and microaggression, I am deciding, at the advice of friends, to formally certify Boog as an Emotional Support Animal through the US Dog Registry. This way, it would be a intensely evident legal issue for him to deny housing for my ESA and I. This is an expensive process and is something I was never expecting to have to do. To register him, it will cost me $199 plus shipping for all of the materials necessary. The reason why this is $210 is because this site takes money from the total and the shipping will cost me as well. 


This would help me so immensely and continue to help me grow and thrive during my second year at Hampshire. I can't defeat this ableism alone as a person with few monetary resources. Any amount will help and would be so, so appreciated. 


Thank you so much. 


Love, 


Brett and Boog

Hello everyone,  I never thought I would have to resort to a gofundme. If you know me I have fully supported myself and my animals my whole adult life. This year has been rather rough with school and a career change that didn't go as planned. I am financially in a horrible spot and now have a very injured dog to take care of. I personally have been looking at a second job, selling my belonging and recently started giving plasma to help normal daily bills and to start making a dent in his surgery cost.  As many of you know my pride and joy is Cash my dog. Many of you have personally met him and fallen in love with his laid back personality and chubby ewok looks. Cash has always suffered from heath issues but this is a major one that need attention now. He needs his luxating platella reset, excessive scar tissue removed and a torn ligament repaired. At this point he can't walk more than a couple minutes and needs to be carried up and down all stairs and in a stroller. He is on pain meds currently that are making him sick and is undergoing testing for Cushing disease. He will be 7 in November so he still has much life to live. I am reaching out in hopes that you will help. Anything will help us at this point.   If you choose to donate just know I greatly appreciate you and what you are doing. Also I am a licsened esthetician and am willing to offer free waxing service at your house if you would like. Donations of 75 or more get a free back, chest, or brazillian wax. Donations of over 125 get a free full arm, full leg or any other service besides male brazillians. Text me or private message me to set up a waxing time. I am asking for the only reason I would ever reach out. To save my best friend. Thanks

Cancer took K-9 Titan away from us on May 27, 2016 very sudden and unexpectedly. He served faithfully for 4 years under the command of Officer Phil Martin and Officer Chris Stockton. During his career he made many felony apprehensions and assisted in the search for dozens of missing persons. His productivity included 31 narcotics arrests, 316 searches, nearly 700 grams of marijuana seized, as well as 15 grams of crack cocaine, and 41.3 grams of crystal meth. He was loved by all members of the police department and will be sorely missed. Due to the unfortunate and sudden passing of a beloved member of the agency the Police Department has received an abundance of support and WE THANK YOU. This support has included numerous requests to donate to the K-9 program. We have already received multiple walk in donations however supporters have asked us to open a web based option. These donations will assist the agency in a replacement K-9 along with the mandatory training and expenses that are required for the Team to once again focus on their mission.

                        Update: Guinness passed away on Friday night. All donations will go to his final medical bill and doggy remains. Thank you everyone. We will miss him.  We adopted Guinness in San Francisco as a companion for Oscar, another dachshund. Dachshunds love to be in community so this was a great fit. They played with each other despite the fact that Guinness was very sick. He had eaten his first owner's meth and was very high for a long time. His first owner left him at the Oakland Humane Society to be euthanized. One of the vet techs decided to help him recuperate and then found us through word of mouth.Fast forward 5 years and Guinness was diagnosed with lymphangestasia right after I had a kidney transplant. We were both on immuno suppressive drugs before we knew it, and luckily he was able to recover after getting a plasma treatment and great care at the Animal Medical Hospital of Seattle.Guinness is now 11, and has another flare of his intestinal disease. He needs another plasma drip to get nutrients, otherwise his recovery is dire.If you've ever met him, you know that he makes everyone feel like they're his favorite person. He will bring you his ball to play with him, and come lay on his back for belly rubs.For a long time, we lived in a residence hall on a college campus (Seattle U), and he was the dog (not Oscar) that all the students were drawn to because of his peppy attitude and his love of life. It's been so painful to watch his health decline and see him back to the way that we met him - skinny and boney.Getting another plasma drip won't cure his illness, it's a chronic illness, but it will help alleviate his pain and give his body something to work with so he can gain weight again. There are no guarantees that this treatment will help, but why not try? I can't afford to do this on my own, and I am sheepish to ask for help, but Guinness has given so much to everyone he meets, so it was worth a try to ask for help.Thank you for being part of our lives - we are so grateful to have you in our community. Guinness has a full and happier because you are in it.

                        Hello,Today, Bear one of our very own Luna x Zeus puppies was hit by a car. The damage was significant with many fractures & breaks in his leg. Bear is 9 months old and belongs to three wonderful children and their parents. He has become a huge part of their family and they are devastated. Upon speaking with them while at the vet today, they asked if I knew anyone that could afford the medical bills, they would be willing to surrender them to a donor at the very hope of keeping him alive, wetold him that is not an option. WE will raise the money to help them through this procedure. The cost is estimated at $4,500.00 total. West Michigan K9 will be making a sizeable donation to help offset this cost, and we are asking for our WMK9 family to come together and help out.If you can afford to Bear's family would be forever appreactive of your generiousity.If you have any questions you can contact me directly at 231.557.6446.

                        Meet Rambo. Rambo is a big, 80 pound lap dog full of energy, love, and kisses. His favorite things to do are run laps in the backyard, chase after squirrels, and give hugs (real ones!). Unfortunately, all of these thing are now impossible for him to do. Rambo was injured in an awful accident this weekend leaving him unable to use his front leg. He successfully underwent his first emergency surgery on Tuesday the 13th. Pins are holding together the multiple fractures in his leg. Nerve and muscle damage have been done and a full recovery is only possible through therapy and possibly more surgeries. Every frequent dressing change is having to be done at the vets office due to the location of the wounds and his size. Antibiotics and pain pills, among other medications, are being administered to keep Rambo somewhat comfortable. The vet bills are stacking up as most of you pet owners could imagine. If there is any way you could help get Rambo the recovery he deserves, please do! This is just the beginning of a long road Rambo faces and we'd hate to see him suffer because of an issue with funding. Please help our fur baby get back to a normal life and back on his feet

On July 2 my sweet boy threw up his breakfast minutes after eating. This was the second time he threw up in one week so I raced him to the vet. After multiple blood tests and x-rays the vet told me my boy had pancreatitis and would need to be hospitalized for the holiday weekend. I was able to bring him home on the fourth day, feeding him several small meals throughout the day as his body tolerated.On August 13 he had a major setback so we went back to the vet for more testing. Again, as with pancreatitis, there was a short withholding of food to give his pancreas time to rest. And then start up the regimen again. This time, he did not bounce back and kept struggling, losing weight and strength. My heart was breaking every day and I was desperate to save mysweet little Gabriel. We ran more tests, indicated that he still had active pancreatitis. Over the course of the next two weeks, Gabriel had multiple blood tests, ACTH test for Addison's(negative), bile acid test for possible liver shunt, complete G.I. panel overnighted on ice to A&M University, and finally more x-rays. The x-rays showed that the food was not moving from his stomach and emergency surgery was scheduled the next morning. I begged everyone I know and even those I didn't know to please pray for my baby to survive his surgery. As weak as he was, miraculously he pulled through. The next day his blood sugar was crashing as it had several times in the previous week. When the vet office closed for the evening I took him to the vet ER for them to monitor him through the night. They were very concerned about his condition and recommended a blood transfusion as well as more bloodwork. Before I left him they allowed me a visitation in the back with my little baby and I stood there talking to him holding his paw as we would do driving to the vet every day for fluids. This time Gabriel clutched my hand with his paw which I will never forget. The ER vet was very concerned again with his condition when I called a few hours later for an update. The transfusion was not going well and she slow down the rate. She called me at 2:40 in the morning to say that she felt he was suffering and she thought the biopsies that his regular vet had taken during his abdominal surgery were pot were leaking. She also suspected that he was septic. My heart sank and I was crushed. I raced to the ER to relieve him from his suffering. I spent a few minutes with him alone telling him How much I loved him and how he's been such a strong boy fighting all this time and he's my best friend. I gently kissed the top of his head and I let him go. There is this horrible emptiness and sadness, yet I am so grateful to have had such a great, goofy and vibrant little friend who has entertained me with his enthusiasm for life.

Our last game of ball together, August 15.Resting in my lap.

Meet Milo. Milo was found on the side of the road, weighing less than 3.5 ounces, and was in desperate need of medical attention. His eyes were so infected that he could not open them. Milo was taken to the vet, only to be informed that he was born with a condition called Eyelid Agenesis, which means he was born without eyelids. Since the wonderful couple who had found him was unable to keep him, Milo was dropped off at the local animal shelter and was close to being left to be euthanized at only 3 months old since the facility was unable to provide care for Milo's special needs. I instantly fell in love with Milo, and he has since become my whole world.. Milo and I have seen a Veterinary Ophthalmologist regarding his condition. We learned that Milo requires surgery or he will soon develop extremely painful ulcers and require entire eye removal. Our other option, as otherwise suggested, was euthanasia. This kitten has quickly come to mean everything to me, as I have no family close by and am so beyond in love with him that I cannot stand the thought of losing him this early on. Already working two jobs and saving as much as I can, the surgery required is a far shot for me at the quoted $3,500. I have already saved some money, but Milo's eyes get worse by the day, and I fear that my worst nightmare will become reality. Milo's initial rescuers and I are doing everything we can to give Milo a chance. Please help save kitty's eyes, and give this adorable fluff ball the life he deserves! Thank you for considering donating to Milo's cause..... he will forever be grateful!

INGLESIDE, IL                                




As this may reach people I don't know , thank you, in advance for taking the time to read my story. My name is Dana and like most people I have to work multiple jobs to support myself and my children, who just happen to be dogs. For those who know me, you know that I would do anything for them. One of them recently tore the ligament in their knee completely and I am unable to fix it on my own. The surgery ranges from $1100-$5000 depending on how the knee is repaired. 
For the first time in my life, I am reaching out for help, to strangers and friends, and friends of friends. 
Before I ""officially"" ask for help, let me tell you a little about my boy. His name is Liam and although he is just one of my ""kids"", he is my ""heart dog."" Liam came from a shelter, quite a few years ago now, heartworm positive and underweight. He had been relinquished to a shelter in response to a breed ban in his ""home"" state. How exactly did I end up with him? At the time, I had just lost a dog (age 18 months) to juvenile kidney disease and was about to lose another dog to lymphoma. Liam came to me from a wonderful rescue and he was instrumental in healing the hole that came from losing two of my dogs in just a matter of months. Liam has a smile for everyone, and hugs for his favorite people. He started out as an underweight, very sick boy and became a loyal, overly affectionate, and happy one. His discomfort is very obvious and it breaks my heart to see him hurt and be unable to fix his problem immediately. As I mentioned earlier, Liam is just one of my ""kids"" and another one, Sully Bug, had been very sick a few months ago and I am just now almost finished paying that vet bill. It was nowhere near the $1100 I need to fix Liam's knee. I understand that everyone is financially strapped, but I am ""officially"" asking for help. I don't expect to raise the full amount, it's a lot of money, but whatever I can raise will be enough to put towards fixing my boy. If you can find it in your hearts to donate the spare change from the car seats, or the change back from a grocery bill. I am ever so grateful to those of you who decided to read my story and could never fully express in words how much your generosity means to me, no matter what the amount. 
I have his surgery tentatively scheduled for mid-June. All raised funds will go directly to his surgery bill and if by chance I raise more than the full amount, the difference will go to another pet parent in need of assistance. 
Thank you all ever so much,
Dana & Liam

The family that initially found him just a few moments before we arrived had zero intentions of helping him. They had picked him up and their intention was to leave him there as he was found. They noticed us staring at them and only then they decided to ask if the cat was ours. We said ""no"" and asked if they were going to take him home or to an animal rescue shelter. They said ""no"" and asked us if we wanted him because they couldn't do anything for him. We decided to take him in and try to save his life. Even though our current living situation does not accommodate pets, we would not turn our back and let him die. We didn't think he would make it through the night and this is him after 12 hours of constant care. ""We have recieved many direct messages on Instagram requesting to make an account so it is possible for people to help Trident on his recovery. Any and all contributions made to Trident go directly to his Veterinary and continued care. With your help you can make sure that Trident receives the best care possible, and allows him to stay with a family that will never hurt or abandon him, and also give him the unconditional love that every living soul deserves.

                        Tulip came to us 3 weeks ago from Detroit Animal Control. She was brought in as a stray, and even though her history is unknown it was easy to tell by looking at her she had encountered some hard times in her young life.She walks with a severe limp, and being such a tender young age, we knew it had to be some sort of trauma to the leg.After a trip to the vet for x-ray's, they discovered the leg had been broken/dislocated at the joint. It is healing in a way that is causing her pain and will continue to cause her pain throughout her life if it isn't fixed.Tulip is just barely a year old and has a full life ahead of her. If we are unable to get her the surgery she needs, the leg will have to be amputated. She is so sweet and loving despite whatever she might have been through in the past. She hasn't met anyone (human or animal) that she doesn't like! Please help us save Tulip's leg, any and all donations are appriciated!Thank you!

Attention LEO members, friends and allies:As you probably already know, the city of Flint is currently involved in a prolonged water crisis due to exceptionally high levels of lead found within city drinking water. High levels of lead have been found not only at the University of Michigan- Flint campus and within Flint public schools, but also within the homes of dozens of LEO members. The time to act is now. During the next few weeks, LEO is asking any and all members, friends and allies to make a financial contribution that will go towards helping the community of Flint have access to clean, un-poisoned water until the crisis is resolved. All donations will go towards providing clean drinking water to the community and public schools.The Lecturers' Employee Organization is the union of all nontenure-track faculty at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint. We are affiliated with AFT-Michigan and the AFL-CIO (#6244). Thank you!

                        Lufian has been sick since before July 2016 with random symptoms like balding ears, diarrhea, not eating, ect. We've been to the vet more than 12 times now and finally have some answers after an ultrasound. So far it's an inflammation of his G.I track and he has abnormal lymphnodes at the moment. We are doing more medication and fecal samples for the next three weeks and then another ultrasound to see if his lymphnodes have gone down in size. Anything to help a loving cat momma would be appreciated. Unknown vet bills to come. I have already spent my savings and maxed out my credit cards on the bills and cannot afford it anymore.

MEBANE, NC                                





                        Hi -This is Sam, brutally attacked in his own yard Sunday morning, August 14, 2016, by 5 roaming dogs. They had already killed the 16 year old cat in her yard next door and possibly 2 other cats at an adjoining property (owners are still looking for them).Sam was one of a number offeral kittens I had fixed for the owners and neighbors about 6 years ago and has been loved by his owners ever since. On Sunday, they were able to beat the dogs off and they came to get me to help. I rushed him to the emergency clinic where they stabilized him and then on Monday, he was transferred to Mebane Pet Clinic, under the care of the amazing Dr. E.After thorough exams, xrays, etc, it was determined that Sam's jaw is broken in several places and his sternum is broken as well. He has puncture wounds and some other trauma but wasfairly stable and not in pain.I brought Sam home last night for overnight care and took him by the owners to say goodbye, as I truly did not think that Sam was going to make it and I didn't think he really wanted to be here. I thought that Tuesday morning, I would bring him back to the vet for euthanasia.But Sam proved me WRONG! Not only does he want to be here but he is purring, making biscuits, and trying very hard to eat the syringes full of yummy food we are giving him. It is hard for him to swallow but he clearly is a fighter and wants to stay here.Dr. E has repaired one part of the jaw but the TMJ joint is the fracture that requires aspecialist surgeon and that surgery cost is out of my reach. The repair needs to be done soon before it starts to heal out of place.The jaw mustbe repaired in order for him to eat on his own and the specialty surgery hospital is his only chance.The money raised will go directly towards the expenses incurred at the specialty surgery center (quote should be available to post soon - verbal estimate of $3200). Iam asking for a bit more just in case we go over. I am absorbing all of the other expenses.If we raise any money over the requested amount, that money will go to Independent Animal Rescue's feral cat fund. Sam's brother, Forest, was shot years ago and after weeks of me trying to catch him (I just thought he had a fight wound), I finally did and IAR took him in and saved his life. For that I amvery grateful. I want to give the same chance for Sam. So any additional funds will go towards helping other ferals in need.

                        I volunteer at a local Humane Society Shelter...but one night about three weeks ago, I was at our local County Shelter right at closing time when a man and his teenage son came in, the son carried this very frightened, and quiet young German Shepherd.  They said they had noticed her under some bushes on their street for the past few days....and finally decided she needed help. They had wrapped her left hind leg in an ace bandage, and knew they could not afford to take her to a vet, so brought her to the shelter.  She laid quietly on the bench for quite awhile until the animal tech came to pick her up.  He wrapped a leash around her muzzle several times, and proceeded to carry her under her front legs,not using the cart that had been provided!  Needless to say it looked painful and unnecessary, but we couldn't do much about his behavior! The sweet dog just went along with his rough demeanor, and allowed herself to be taken away...I finished the business I had there, but when I went home I could not get her out of my mind!  I checked on her every day, and was told she was not microchipped, and that no one had called about a lost female German Shepherd, or come in to see her!  I was also told that she had been hit by a car and left to die by the side of the road...her tail is broken; her pelvis is shattered; and her left femur has been shoved out of the socket and up into her body.....she will need extensive and expensive surgery to help her walk again without horrific pain.I tried contacting the German Shepherd Rescues in our Bay Area, but they were all out of funds for veterinary emergencies.  She was in a high-kill County Shelter....there was no chance they would save her....and she sat there for three weeks!! She wasn't even given a name, so I could ask about her ... just the dog in J03! I went to the shelter on the day before her time was up, and took her home.  My dogs and I named her Heidi...I felt like I needed to follow the adage that says ""If you are witness to something, and do nothing about it, you are equally responsible"".......this dog is not more than 10 or 11 MONTHS old, I just couldn't let her die!However, I do not have the funds to pay for veterinary care, or such a complicated surgery.  I am hoping that by doing this page, I can ask for just a little help, from a lot of folks who truly care about dogs and know how much they do for us.....I'm sure if the situation were reversed, Heidi would do the same for me in a heartbeat!Heidi also needs to be spayed...so the sooner we get started on her road to recovery, the better. Dogs are such a huge part of my life, and I know there are hundreds of people who feel like I do, that we have a much richer existence because of them...please help me to help Heidi so her life will be as good as originally intended...she is so sweet, lets my dogs finish her food,and wants so badly to be able to play with them!Thank You in advance to anyone who can help in any way!! :)

My cat Mamas Fritas (will turn 2 on 9/27/2016), was attacked by our neighbors dog on 9/14 at 8pm and I have no hope of being able to pay for the surgery completely. We have been in to the vet 6 times, and the infection has gotten worse. She had a few puncture wounds on her rear end. She had a drainage tube and a few stitches put in. She has finally come around and started to eat and drink and use the bathroom, but her infection has mastatised into a large lump and all the flesh has died and is rotting away around it. I am hoping, now that I have asked for a few different price comparisons and a second and third opinion, that it won't cost $4,000+.. but I want to give her the best care possible and quickly, before things get any worse. We had a culture done on her this morning and are waiting on the results. The dead flesh will still have to be removed and the procedure will cost over 2,000 and that is not including the after care. We have already taken a credit card out, from care-credit, and maxed it out for her. I don't usually ask for help even from my own family, but I have used all my resources and am still short funds. My family says she should be put down but she is healing and getting better! It's an infection on her hindquarters, not a death sentence. I love her dearly and she is one of the sweetest, most friendly, and intelligent cats, it's hard to believe. We call her little dog because it's as if she doesn't even know she's a cat. God willing, universe providing, I am desperate for help and the kindness of people. Thank you for your time to even read this! Have a good day! My Dog Jack and her have an Instagram if you'd like to learn more about our family.. @pegleg_jack

Miswaki Brew needs our help! ,"$1,175 ","$5,000 ",Animals," June 13, 2016",14,3,JUPITER,FL,124000,,2,"

JUPITER, FL                                




Luckily, Miswaki Brew was rescued by Florida TRAC after her racing days were over. Even luckier, Jupiter Equestrian Center adopted her and their dedicated trainers have been re-training Miswaki for a new life; to be part of their group of school horses that young riders use to learn about horsemanship and equestrian sports. Since she first stepped into the barn, Miswaki has been a wonderful addition to the program and her re-training has been coming along nicely. Loving, smart, and forgiving, she is now a school favorite.But this poor sweet girl is having a health crisis. This season we have had an abundance of rain in South Florida and the ground has been saturated for very long periods. What started as a common hoof abscess has progressed quickly to a coffin bone infection. So far, the vet has performed 2 regional antibiotic profusions directly into the abscessed hoof/pastern, and daily IV bags of DMSO systemically to stop the inflammation in the other hooves due to the uneven distribution of her weight on her other legs. She has had numerous x-rays which require sedation and nerve blocks, as well as round the clock care, pain medication and oral antibiotics. This has all been very exhausting and expensive, but necessary treatment for this special horse. And shes not out of the woods yet.Good veterinary care is costly. And these types of emergencies can quickly drain resources. The staff at Jupiter Equestrian Center is doing their best but are stretched thin by the escalating vet bills. We cant give up on this gorgeous young horse now! She wouldnt give up on us. So we are asking for help. Please help us get Miswaki the care she deserves by making a donation. Any donation would be greatly appreciated and ensure we can do everything possible for our Miswaki! Thank you so much for your consideration and support!!!

                        Gizzy was abandoned when our neighbor was evicted and has been homeless for a few months. She was very under weight and starving. We started putting food out for her and we have slowly gained her trust. Friday morning as we were leaving for work, we noticed she was limping.  She ran from us when we tried to approach her.  Upon returning home from work, the food was still out but she finally came to eat.  We managed to pick her up and brought her inside.  She could not put her right leg down and we did not want her outside until we could get her to the vet Saturday morning. We just returned from the vet and her tibia is completely broken in two. They put it in a cast and said it will take time to heal. She has to go back to the vet in 2 weeks for a check and 4 weeks for more x-rays.  We got her rabies shot, flea medicine and pain medicine and we are more than happy to help Gizzy but we have 3 other cats, one who is 14 years old and has kidney disease. The vet bills are mounting up and any donation will be appreciated so we can care for her until we can find her a furever home.

                        Our small town in western Maryland is wealthy in water. We are situated in the mountains and enjoy a nice water supply fed by mountain streams and the Youghiogheny River. We are heartsick over the lead poisoning suffered by the adults and especially the children of Flint Michigan. We will use the money to buy a large shipment of water in 1 to 2.5 gallon containers which is their identified need. Garrett County, MD is the original source of Deer Park Water and water donations from water suppliers and distributors will be solicitied as well. Please help us help the children and families of Flint Michigan get through this crisis.This is important to us because we have so much water and want to help those that have none. Our town of Freindsville and the western Maryland region is a relatively low income area (average income in our town is $28,000) and we are on the verge of having our water resources drilled for gas extraction and potentially having our water poisoned by the development of a large scale industrial gas field in our finest water resource areas and watersheds. We can appreciate what it would mean to have to buy every drop of water at high prices in order to survive. This effort would help bring attention to our plight and hopefully help us protect our water for the long term by raising awareness and strengthening the effort for strict water protections.We would make a simple video about this effort, submit press releases, place banners on the transport vehicles and other methods of outreach to bring attention to the problem in Flint but also to bring attention to the threats our water resource is currently under. No water - no life, please help us, join us, send ideas, all assistance is welcome. All funds will be used for Transport Expenses and Water. I am donating all my time for Admin and PR Efforts.We are also exploring ways in which we can return with empty bottles for recycling or use in building projects? All ideas and support welcome, appreciated and mentioned.

I'm kind of embarrassed to be doing this but because I'm a sucker for animals of all kinds, I am left no option. I feed a colony of ferals and have for about 6 years. This year one had a litter of kittens all male with the exception of the runt. I figured I would be feeding 5 more ferals and breaking up fights if I didn't rescue them. I bottle fed and bathed and medicated and was able to adopt out two of the sweeties. Three months later I am still caring for the remaining three. Possum the female runt became very ill last night and spent the night on oxygen at the Vet ER with concerns that she may not survive the night. But my little fighter did and transitioned to my vet today. They are still a bit puzzled at the true diagnosis. We are already at 1100 bucks and climbing and these rescues haven't even had shots or been fixed yet. Help lil Possum pweeese!

                        This big guy is Odo. Hes a super sweet, 2 years old Australian cattle dog mix that should be running, playing and herding people and/or animals with no problem. However, he struggles to walk because of a genetic disorder that makes his knees dislocate constantly. As you can imagine its very painful when the knee dislocates, causing sudden severe lameness of the limb, until the kneecaps slide back into place.This is known as Bilateral Patellar Luxation. Its congenital abnormality that starts at the hip joint and results in abnormal forces on the kneecap, which cause it to go outside of the knee groove. The ligament of the patella gets malpositioned which can make the tibia and femur bones become twisted. Poor Odo probably has never known a day without pain because of this condition. Even though he struggles, he keeps trying to move forward, showing his gratitude and love to each person that tries to help him.Odo was a stray that we saved from Dallas Animal Services two weeks ago. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing if he has ever seen a vet or been evaluated or watched for decrease functioning of his legs. What we do know is Odo's right knee is at a grade 3, and surgery is needed immediately. Hes in pain and barely puts any weight on it. However, the left knee is a grade 2.5 and will need to be fixed in the very near future.Per the orthosurgeon, there is 90% chance for a full recovery of function if we move quickly. If left untreated,there is a 100% chance that he could lose all ability to walk while remaining in constant pain from debilitating arthritis of the joint.Reconstructive surgery of soft tissues surrounding the knee cap to loosen the side toward which the patella is riding and tighten to the opposite side before the surgeon addresses any other issues. His aftercare will involve anti-inflammatory medications, limited exercise for about 2 to 3 months, before starting rehabilitation therapy.Odo is all heart and we want to give him a full and pain-free life. He has been teaching us that love, patience and trust can change everything. We need your help!Please consider a donation to Odo's Knee Surgery Fund today.Paws in the City is an all-volunteer, no-kill nonprofit organization that believes in helping all animals in need, like Odo. We do this work with only the donations we raise. We are deeply grateful to receive anysupport.

Help4Hercules Orthopedic Surgery,"$1,110 ","$4,250 ",Animals," September 11, 2016",21,14,WASHINGTON,DC,96000,,1,"






                            Justin Gonzalez
                            
                            
                                                           
WASHINGTON, DC                                




Hercules ""Pumpkin"" Gonzalez, Stadfordshire Mastiff Mix, was adopted from the Washington D.C. Humane Society (Georgia Ave) in July of 2014. When we were searching for a companion we were looking for a small dog to live with us in our condo here in Washington. When I first laid eyes on Hercules (Mr. Burgundy at the time) I instantly fell in love with his quiet and loving demeanor. I took no time to deliberate, we had an instant connection and having him live with us for the past 1.5 years has proven to sanction my original gut instinct; He was the one for us!We are not 100% positive as to the cause of his angular limb deformity, however, we were told it was a genetic abnormality not uncommon in large breed dogs, specifically in Mastiffs. Other conversations and trips to the vet have raised concerns of a possible limb fracture in his early years that went without appropriate treatment. In either case, Hercules has delt with his reducedmobility and resulting paw padissues as a result of the incorrect distribution of weight and resulting manner of walking. He has trouble climbing and descending the stairs in our walk up condo. He has limited to no strength in the lower portion of his deformed front leg. He uses it as a crutch. The vet fears due to his large size (94lbs at 2 yrs old) and resulting limp/staggered walk, he will experience early life back problems, arthritis in his joints, and a life of painful cracking paws.As seen in he photo above, his abnormal leg and weight distribution has affected the shape of his paw pads. As he performs normal activities such as walking, his paw pads take more of a beating than nature intended and they form a thick layer of protective callus, which is much less flexible than the pad itself. Because of this the paw cracks. The cracks are extremely painful and are easily infected. Hercules experiences this quite regularly ( 1-2 times a month) and is unable to walk. We have to carry him up and down the stairs for him to use the restroom or eat.Despite enduring the painful cracking paws and his limited mobility, Hercules has always been and continues to be a happy and loving dog and a vital member of our family. His happiness and quality of life is important to us. His surgery to correct the angular deformity costs $5,300 plus 5 total office visits including radiographs and post operation visits costing $290 each ($1,450 total) for a total of $6,750. When faced with finding a way to acquire a large sum of money or watching a memeber of your family suffer it breaks your heart to realize you simply don't have the money on your own. Many financial assistance organizations require the injury be life threatening to qualify for assistance. While not life threatening,the issues Hercules faces are threatening to his quality of life and future. We have been saving since we first adopted Hercules but we simply do not have enough. We have about $2,500.00 and are hoping that the kindness of family, friends, and strangers will help us get Hercules the help he needs and make sure we give him the life he deserves.

                        This is Bruce. He appeared outside my family's home a few weeks ago, searching for food and shelter. Upon feeding him, it was apparent that he was very friendly and wanted to come inside. An exhaustive search for anyone who may have owned him turned up no results, and shelters everywhere are full to capacity. We have tried finding him an owner, but no one has been able to take him. I want to be able to take in Bruce and give him the home and love he wants, but finances are all that is standing in my way. The money I hope to raise will primarily go towards security costs in order for my landlords to allow him to live with me. I would greatly appreciate whatever help you can give to me and Bruce. Thank you!

                        This is a first time fundraiser to help us provide better for our foster puppies, full grown, and elder dogs. Since January 2015 we have fostered and rehomed over 220 dogs and pups. Alot of our full grown and elder dogs come to us Heartworm Positive. Also, many of the other dogs and puppies have been severely abused, abandoned, or neglected. We have had some that have had to have the heartworm treatmentthat are 8 yrs old plus and have other health issues, that we have kept and provided a sanctuary for them to enjoy the rest of their days. We do this because their chance for adoption is very slim. With all of our fosters, we strive to heal them physically and mentally, socialize them, and prepare them for a forever home. As you can realize, our food bill is high. Freedom Fences, who we foster through, help us greatly with vetting, food, etc. Most of these dogs are rescued from high kill shelters or unfit conditions.Our fundraiser, is to assist us in building longer roofs over our existing pens, building more pens, and purchasing a Prefab Kennel Building or large shed, which will be retrofitted with indoor & outdoor runs, for a nursery for puppies, and their mama's if still nursing pups, as well as bathing, grooming, and other special needs of the dogs. We both work full-time jobs and doextra odd jobs to provide for all of these babies, as we call them, which takes hours a day, and we do all of what we dowith lovefor the dogs, without compensation, because without doing what we do, their fate would be death.Any donation will be greatly appreciated and Elizabeth and I along with all of the dogs we help, will be forever grateful and thankful for your support. Thank You in advance for your help. AJP.S We are a 501c3 charitable organization, all donations are tax deductible. Please Help!!!!!!

Help Buddy in his golden years.,$920 ,"$1,500 ",Animals," February 22, 2016",14,7,CORONA,CA,95000,,3,"






                            John Lemieux
                            
                            
                                                           
CORONA, CA                                




Buddy is a stray dog that was living on the streets in the Temescal Canyon area of Corona. We don't know if he was dumped here or just wandered from his home. As we have since found out,he was first found back in December but before he could be found a good home he was lost again.He came to usthrough a friend in Spanish Hills where he showedup acouple of weeks ago. They gave him food and water and tried to find his owner but were not successful. He was dirty, matted and hip bones and spine showed clearly through his thick coat. He seemed like such a sweet dog we decided to try to find his owner and if we could not, we would keep him.First things first. A trip the the vet to see if he is chipped. He is!!! The problem is there is no information about him in the vets data base except where he was originally chipped, but there was a phone number for this place. So the next morning I called and they had the information on his owner and would call them and get back to us. He was originally adopted out (and chipped) as a puppy in 2003. That makes him quite and old man. When we heard back, we were told that he was ""re-homed"" six years ago but they didn't know who they gave him too. Hmmm, sounds a little fishy to me, but I digress.So I bring Buddy to work with me every day and that morning he is walking around my shop and picks up a piece of sandpaper. I didn't think he should be chewing on that so I tried to take it from him. He would not give it up. I waited until he dropped it to pick it up and when I did he bit my hand. Oh man, this dog is a biter? I can't have a biting dog. How am I going to find a 13 year old stray dog that bites a home? If he goes to a shelter he will surely be put to sleep when no one adopts him.I posted my dilema of Facebook to see if any of my friends might know of someone willing to take care of an old dog. No takers, but several requests to give him another chance. Who know what this poor guy has been through and what was going through his mind at that time. Since then there has been no signs of aggression of any sort, just the same sweet dog he always seemed to be. We decided to give him another chance and took him back to the vet to get checked him checked out as he did have some strange behaviors that might indicate an problem, He drinks excessively (water ;-) ), and pants at night for no apparent reason. He also has arthitis in his hips and cannot move very well. He needs to be lifted in and out of the car.Well, we got his blood tests back and there is not good news. It is likely the poor guy has Cushing's Disease. This can be caused by a tumor on his Pituitary Gland or Adrenal Gland and would explain his panting and excessive drinking. It can be controlled with medication but will require many tests and followup visits to get his medication doses correct as too much of this medication will kill him and the only way to know we got it right is several followup blood tests at 10 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months.Then he will be on medication twice a day for the rest of his life. Estimates for initial battery of tests, medication and ultra sound is aproximately $1500 and monthly medication costs of approximately $100-$150 depending on his dosage.Cushing's disease is not usually fatal (but can be if the tumor is on the adrenal gland and it ruptures). We believe this old dog is worth saving and deservesto have a good life in his last years. We would like to get a definative diagnosis and a treatment plan for him. We have been offered financial help by one person who's life Buddy touched, (you know who you are) butwe declined the offer at the time. We didn't know at the time we would be looking at such a substantial cost to get him healthy again and would appreciate anything anyone can give to help this old stray have a loving home for his final years. We are willing to love him and take care of him. Are you willing to help? Any amount you can spare will help him get the diagnosis and treatment he needs and we will take it from there. Thank you for taking the time to hear Buddy's story and share it with your friends.

Luna's Life Line,"$1,000 ","$4,000 ",Animals," June 3, 2016",17,3,SOUTH GLASTONBURY,CT,93000,1,11,"

                        Luna has been the life of the party since she was a little kitty! Given to us as the fiesty runt of a ferral cat's litter, we quickly realized she wasn't any ordinary cat. She befriended our dogs with a commradary uncommon even amongst the best of dog/cat relationships. She truly thought she was part of the pack.  And the dogs  loved her for it.  Because she was! They even shared their food bowls with her WHILE they ate! Luna also figured out how to ""walk"" her owners. Following us on trail walks through the woods and beckoning us when she wanted us to go this way or that. Every morning following Drew to the bus stop, waiting while he got on, then walking us back to the house. She has lightened up our lives in so many ways and now we are faced with her sudden and rapid demise.  Just shy of five weeks postpartum to five beautiful and healthy kitties, Luna is losing weight, vomiting,  and severely dehydrated.  Up until this morning her appetite and thirst have been normal, even increased, but she has been unable to keep up her weight.  Then this morning after begging for more food she vomited 3x and started to look ill. I rushed her to the vet with the boys and have come back tonight because all the treatments didn't work. She is struggling just to stay hydrated and we have already spent 1000.00 on testing, treatments and now an overnight stay. I had to refuse more tests and stabilization after 12 hours because of cost. There is a suspicion she may have a blockage but without more radiological tests, we have no way of knowing how to treat her. Please, whatever you can spare to keep Luna in our lives would mean the world to us. This month last year we had to put our beloved German Shepherd dog down suddenly due to cancer. It crushed our boys and us. Luna had been a huge help in that grieving process and now her life is in danger. Please help us save Luna this time around! She still has babies to care for  and boys to follow to the bus stop next year! Thank you all for taking the time to read this and possibly share our story.

                        Hello, my name is Pinstripe. I am an old trotter though I keep my mom guessing exactly how old, she doesn't know. She saved me from slaughter and I have been living at her Horses N' Hounds rescue learning to be a good horse so another family will love me. I was adopted but for some reason we didn't get along and now I have come back home to my rescue. The problem is my mom has fallen on hard times and no longer can afford to keep me or my adoptedbrothers and sisters.We got together one night and decided that if people can help pitch in with donations, our rescue home can stay open so our mom can continue to work with us and teach us trust and skills so we can be adopted. Or for us old timers that may not find a family in time, we can have a place where we are loved and spend our days with our friends. Speaking of which, my 5 year-old neighbor Annejust poked her head out and wants to say hi:Please consider helping get my mom through these hard times so she does not have to sell the farm and send us away or have to send us to the green pastures of horsey heaven before our time. As you can see from my picture below, I love my mom and although I know I may be loved by another family someday, I need more time here to learn to trust other people.Winter is especially hard on our mom. Heating costs are up and with the pastures now under snow, feed costs are up to keep my belly full. Any help is much appreciated. Please help save Horses N' Hounds before we lose our home.Rescue mission: to rehabilitate mistreated horses and build a human/horse bond again through trust and respect. The farm formerly fostered dogs as well but has been discontinued. All funds now go into serving the horses. No training methods that create fear responses. It is a slow process since incoming horses usually have signs of abuse and sometimes can't be handled at first. But every life deserves a chance to live.Please share this campaign among animal lovers, organizations, and anyone willing to help give second chances. The financial condition is serious and without support from the community, the farm will be taken by the bank or go to short sale. Some horses would have to be relocated whether they are ready or not, to fates unknown. Horses with issues all too often end up at auction and sent to Canada for slaughter. Horses like Pinstripe deserve another chance to be worked with and adopted, or to live a peaceful retirement being happy after all they have been through in their life. Thank you for anything you can do and God bless.

                                                Hello, my name is Gigi and I'm 4 years old. I'm that gorgeous creature on the left with the beautiful white stocking and light brindle coat. Until a couple weeks ago my pal Roofus (on the right) and I were living with a breeder. It was a very bad and scary time. my ""owner"" filed down my teeth and as soon as I was old enough to start breeding, I was put into a cage with little human contact and used as a breeding machine. Fortunately we were rescued and came to Hobo Boxer Rescue and there we found a wonderful foster home who lead us to our Furever Home with our Furever Mom Stacey. Life was going to be so different and sooooo good. I went from being a Boxer who had never had a bed of my own or any toys to play with to living the good life. In true Furever Mom fashion, my mom took me to the vet to have me checked out and make sure I was healthy. The vet said I am severely under weight at 36lbs, suffering from malnutrition, hair loss, skin issues and an old eye injury which my Furever mom is treating. As bad as it sounds, that wasn't the bad news, nope the bad news was that I am Heart Worm positive. After everything I've been through in my short life to have this happen is pretty tough. Treatment is very expensive and my Furever Mom needs help. That's where you come in. If you could please, please with Boxer kisses and wiggle butts on top, find it in your hearts to help her I would be oh so grateful and I know she would too! If you prefer to donate to me directly please contact Amy CaldwellThank you!!

                        My name is Earl Grey and I'm a guinea pig. I recently got really sick with an infection and my human, Alexis, had to take me to an animal hospital. The bill was huge, and I feel awful that it cost her so much. She's a hard worker, working and going to school. And the vet bill is more than she will make in a couple months! Please help any way you can, I am going to get better and I want my human to catch a break! Thank you!

In honor of Love Lutz,$200 ,$500 ,Animals," June 15, 2016",5,3,VIENNA,VA,66000,,6,"

Many of you know that my dog, Love, has recently been diagnosed with an aggressive cancer in her lungs as well as cancer in her bones. According to the oncologist we spoke to, there has been very little advancement in finding an effective treatment or a cure. I would like to raise money to donate to the Animal Cancer Foundation in hopes that one day other dogs and owners wont have to go through the same thing Love and I are going through right now.


I don't expect this to get very far, but I do hope I can make at least some sort of positive difference out of thisunfortunate situation.

Save the Pooches!!,$275 ,"$3,000 ",Animals," August 31, 2016",5,24,SAVANNAH,GA,51000,,1,"

We are planning our 3rd transport/rescue mission for the animals at Chatham County Animal Services & Effingham Animal Control but we need YOUR help! Our last RESCUE MISSION/TRANSPORT in August was a success!!! Thanks to everyone who contributed to our last fundraising efforts, we were able to take 46 dogs and 17 cats on their freedom ride to no kill rescues! Below you will find links to a couple of the news clips from stations that followed our rescue attempts as well as a few pictures of our animals who have already found their forever families!! This rescue mission truly touched our hearts and we know more than ever that THIS is the path we were meant to lead. For that reason we have created this GoFundMe campaign and are getting to work immediately on fundraising projects so that we can go back and do it all again. No matter how big or small of a donation,EVERY penny will make us that much closer to our next rescue mission to save more lives!This will be our third rescue mission/transport and we want to save even more than we ever have before but we need YOUR help! Money raised from this campaign will go toward covering expenses associated with these trips (renting the transport vans, boarding-if we have to move the animals out of the shelter for a given about of time, these animals will have to be put into boarding until transport leaves as well as vaccinating and testing the aniamls to name just a few of the foreseen expenditures). All animals must be tested and vaccinated and have health certificates to travel. Chatham County Animal Services provides these services but Effingham Shelter does not always have a vet on staff nor the resources to provide these services (the last transport H.O.P.E. covered these expenses for them). We do several food drives leading up to the transports as well to help offset the shelter's vetting expenses. We can only pull what we have the money and rescues for so the more money we raise, the more we save!! If you need a letter for your donation for tax purposes, please let me know and we will be happy to accommodate since we are working hand in hand with One Love Animal Rescue which is a 501c3 organization. On behalf of the ones with no voices, we thank you! :) http://wsav.com/2016/08/12/pet-rescue-takes-more-than-60-from-effingham-and-chatham-county-shelters/ http://savannahnow.com/news/2016-08-12/savannahs-one-love-helps-animals-find-new-homes

                        Please welcome Lucy Liu to the Col. Potter family. She is a cute Wheaten female owner surrender who is estimated to be 4 years old. We would say she is a cute little female, but weighing in at 27 pounds, little is not in her description. She will definitely be participating in Col. Potter's boot camp while in foster care. She is missing some of her coat due to flea dermatitis. But with good care and diet it should clear up quickly. Unfortunately, Lucy Liu is heartworm positive, so she will have to undergo a 3 month treatment that includes painful injections to get rid of the heartworms. This treatment is very expensive, but necessary if Lucy Liu is to have an opportunity for a Forever Home. Please donate and help this sweet girl achieve the life she deserves. All good thoughts for Lucy Liu also appreciated! Thank you for your support!Col. Potter Cairn Rescue Network Your donation is tax deductible! Our Federal Tax ID Number is 33-0954902. Any donations exceeding Lucy Lius bills will be put toward another needy Col. Potter Cairn.

Help with Gunnar's medical expenses,$450 ,"$6,000 ",Animals," April 16, 2016",10,5,KENOSHA,WI,80000,1,10,"

KENOSHA, WI                                




My name is Gunnarand I'm just over 8 years old and a very handsome and gentle German Shepherd. Last year my daddyfound a lump on my right thigh that after tests were done, we found out it was a cancerous tumor and 2 weeks laterI had surgery to remove it. After surgery, I got excited and chased a ball that the neighbor threw for me (he didn't know I wasn't supposed to be running or jumping). Well, that ripped the wound open and I was brought to the emergency vet for more treatment. I know my dad spent a lot of money on me to help me get better so after that, I stayed calm and healed up nice and was back to my old self in no time at all. That was up until he gave me a Bully Stick for a treat. I got real sick from bacteria in the treat and ended up with a really upset tummy. Well, another visit to the vet and then being sent to a specialist because my tummy wasn't getting better ended with areport that the doctor felt something funny on my prostate. More tests were done to see what that was. They said that I have dead tissue and crystalized material on my prostate. The doctor said he's 99% certain its cancer.I lose my breath really fast when I run and play now too. This made my daddy and the doctor even more nervous because there may be more cancer than originally thought.  They then sent me to a specialty clinic where they did all sorts of tests on me.Daddy got aphone call informing him that I have a tumor near my prostate but they don't think its attached to it, which they tell me is good but now I'm told I may need another surgery to remove the tumor before it spreads. The doctor also wants to do more tests to make sure I don't have cancer anywhere else and to be sure that isn't why I get so tired all the time. My family really loves me and told the doctor that if tests are needed, they should be done but that they aredesperately trying to find ways to help raise money for me so I can have the tests and the surgery to get rid of this nasty cancer inside of me.  I know my family will do whatever they have to do to help me but I have already used up all the money they had saved up so I'm setting up this campaign to help do my part.I am just trying to raise money towards the surgery and other testing costs so I can help reduce the stress I'm causing them. Please, any amount you can spare would really help. I know my family will be very happy and relieved if I can raise some money to help me get better and I sure would be beyond grateful for the help you can provide too. Also, please share with all your friends and family. Thank you!

Help save Molly. On Wednesday June 15 2016 a puppy was brought to Humane Society of Iredell that was found in downtown Mooresville wandering the streets. HSI agreed to take the puppy in to help find the owner of the puppy. We had the puppy at our facility for about 3 hours when we noticed the puppy was not acting right and then proceeded to start vomiting and we were afraid the puppy had parvo. Acting quickly our director rushed the puppy over to the veterinarian for a check-up. What we suspected came to reality. This sweet little girl has been diagnosed with parvo and is now undergoing treatment. Parvo as most of you know is very expensive to treat so we are seeking your help to fund this babies treatment. It will cost about $2,500 to get her better after the treatment is said and done so any little bit you can provide will help us to save this girl's life. #helpsavemolly

                                                To all visiting this page, hello and thank you for taking the time to read this.The picture above is of my cat Rocky. I've had him in my life for about 9 years now, and he's one of the sweetest cats I've ever known. He's vocal, loves catnip, and his favorite activity is watching the action in the parking lot.In the recent months after moving into our apartment, we noticed our feline son Rocky had lost significant weight, which was a red flag for us from his usual self and decided to take him into the local vet.After a few costly analyses, it was found that Rocky was developing hyperthyroidism, which mainlyhappens to middle-aged cats and is a disorder resulting from exessive thyroid hormone.Immediately we started him on anti-thyroid medication twice a day and monitored him over the next month or so. Everything seemed good, he gained some weight back, but that's only on the exterior.In the last week, Rocky has been having troubles. Lethargic, limping, weak back legs, upset, and licking/chewing on an area near the base of his tail. It was concerning and we decided to take time off work to get an update.The description of the syptoms and the situation we are battling points to us needing to take it a step further in his treament to avoid any complications or early passing at this point in his life. Radioiodine treament is available in a few select areas, but the process is known to be expensive. With over a 95% success rate, effectiveness is pretty much guaranteed and a full recovery follows.We took a few more tests today to be up to date, so we will have an update on how he is doing in the next couple days, but pursuing this treatment is important to us to take care of him in anyway possible, and it looks like medicine alone won't be taking this health issue away.At this point in our lives, a large medical bill is very steep to manage and set aside funds for, and we hope that by putting this post out there that we can help our cat while still being able to afford everything else that goes into our daily lives.We appreciate any help or donations for this situation, and will be ever grateful to anyone willing to help us extend the life of our affectionate companion.Thank you.From Cornell University - College of Veterinary Medicine Feline hyperthyroidism is a disorder resulting from excessive thyroid hormone. The disease occurs in middle-age to older cats without sex or breed predilection. Though functional benign enlargement (adenoma) is most common (98%), thyroid carcinoma (cancer) is another cause (2%). About 70% of cats have both lobes of the thyroid gland affected.Symptoms: May include weight loss, poor hair coat, rapid heart rate, voracious appetite or thirst, anxiety or nervousness, diarrhea or vomiting, and vocalizing.Diagnosis: Lump or mass in the neck detected during a physical exam; elevated levels of thyroid hormone in the blood; isotope imaging that depicts hyper-function as a change in the size, shape, and location of the thyroid glands.Treatment: The four options include anti-thyroid medication, surgery, diet, and radioiodine therapy.Prognosis: Generally good. Cats with severe disease involving many organ systems may not survive. However, most cats, even teenagers, respond well to treatment.Radioiodine is safe and effective with cure rates approximately 95 - 98% with one treatment. Cats can receive a second treatment, if necessary. Radioiodine treatment avoids surgery, anesthesia, and anti-thyroid drugs. A single injection is given subcutaneously (i.e. under the skin, like a vaccine) and the radioactive iodine is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. The iodine is taken into the thyroid gland and incorporated into thyroxine. The majority of cats have normal hormone levels within a week or two of treatment.Additional Information:Radiocat Thyro-Cat

Help Fix My Dogs'  Painful Teeth,$610 ,"$1,000 ",Animals," January 7, 2016",11,8,BELEN,NM,73000,,8,"

                        Hansel and Dieter, my sweet little long-haired dachshunds, desperately need your help. In the posted picture (taken a few years ago) they are beautiful, happy, energetic mouse-hunters and cuddlebugs, but today they are weak and in painbecause of their bad teeth. Yesterday Dieter had to be hydrated at the vet's because he could not eat and barely could drink.  In the last week, both Hansel and Dieter have lost almost half their body weight from some sort of virus, one that they are having a hard time fighting off because of their recurring tooth infections.  The vet said Dieter and Hansel both have advanced dental decay. They both need, at the very least, cleanings, and at worst repair or removal of their damaged teeth. This could cost up to $500 per dog, but without it, they will continue to sicken and suffer. Hansel has already developed a heart murmur from his tooth problems. I try to give them the best care possible, but I am disabled and short of funds. If you can help with this, Hansel and Dieter (and I) will be extremely grateful. They are 11 and 12 and generally should live well into their teens, but their teeth are cutting their lives shorter than necessary--and causing them a great deal of pain. If this request brings in more money than is necessary to repair their teeth and restore their good health, I will give all or most of the extra to the New Mexico Dachshund Rescue Society. That wonderful organization is how Dieter came into our lives. NMDR takes in abandoned, abused, and neglected dachshunds and finds them good, loving homes. Dieter has been part of our family for about 8 years now and is devoted to Hansel, following him around everywhere and curling up with him in their shared dog house. It breaks my heart to see them both so unhappy. Please act quickly. They really need to get the dental care as soon as they overcome their current illness. I don't know if they could withstand another episode like this one. Thank you so much for considering helping,  Debbi (on behalf of Hansel and Dieter)
