If it is approved it means is a loss of our neighborhood services and 17 months of construction noise, dust, debris and congestion, more parking nightmares, traffic and worst of all, loss of community character and identity. Weve gone through a lot, been to a lot of meetings and met a lot of wonderful people like you, and as a result, we have learned how many people deeply care about our city and maintaining the quality of life in Vista.Now is your chance to make a difference. We need legal counsel to continue our campaign against this inappropriate land use in our community. We are not fighting for just Breeze Hill, but for neighborhoods all over Vista who have mixed use zoning that developers are exploiting to build massive apartment projects. Yes, this could happen in your neighborhood.The danger is that once they are built, the developer has no vested interest in the community and the effects of high density housing near lower density neighborhoods are irrevocable.Today, you can be a part of the solution. Please contribute to our GoFundMe campaign so that we can have access to the legal resources we need to ensure this type of development is not approved in Vista. No contribution is too small to make a difference. If you dont think your contribution matters, remember what a famous comedienne said about community involvement: I always wondered if somebody was going to do something about that, and then I realized, I WAS somebody, Lily Tomlin. Thank you for your continued support, though our work we have met incredible people who are dedicated to preserving the quality of life in Vista, please join our community.

We have decided that we want to go and demonstrate for her inclusion in the debates in New York at the first debate. We feel that it is important in a democracy that people get information about ALL their choices. We need to rent a bus and get rooms for one night in New York. We decided to appeal to all of you good people to help us with that so that our voices may be heard. The bus will pick up people from Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York so please share widely!I have decided to update the page with an estimate of actual costs and alter the goal now that we have a good idea of actual costs. Van rental including 3 additional driver fees of $12 per day is $558. It is 1274 miles each way for us. Figuring 10 miles per gallon and $3.00 a gallon to be on the safe side that comes to a total of $768 for gas. If we can get hotel accommodations for $70 a night for 15 people for Sunday night that will cost $1050. Figuring $90 a person for three days of meals for 15 people that comes to $1350. Some of the people travelling are unemployed. The total is $3726. I am modifying the goal to this amount.If we are able to stay under the amount we raise we will be donating the difference to the campaign.We need the funds soon because the debate is on September 26th 2016. This is really important to us because we feel that America needs to know their choices. We would be so greatful if you would help us to realize this plan, and just maybe the whole country will be greatful too.

While a few individuals and local business enterprises have sustained us without prompting, the future growth of this bold and obvious endeavor cannot only be borne by so few forever. Paint, soil, brooms and other basic implements all come with a cost.As you have been witness to these past few years, this mission hasincreasingly involved more of our local youth, faith organizations and ordinary residents. The cost for tools and supplies to continue building momentum for this venture isalready mounting, which is likely to impede our operations, ones designed specifically to restore the confidence of our people through practical, meaningful, worthwhile and easily verifiable projects.Now, therefore, I call upon you, the great and good people of Woodside and others across the wider worldto allow us to capitalize our work for the next and succeeding years. This assertion, you can rest assured, is based squarely on the mountains of evidence you already have in your possession.

Fons American Legion. Unfortunately, our post is in a position of losing our building which would result in not being able to help veterans. Our goal is to save 75 years of tradition, help many local veterans, community members & non-members in various situations. Right now we do not have the funds to pay taxes, the mortgage and other expenses. If we could get donations, we could pay off the building, sell it, then down size to a smaller building with less overhead to keep our tradition alive and continue to help our veterans and community. THATS WHAT WE DO BEST! March 23, 2015 is a pivotal date. We are at risk to be closed down without the means to have a lender re-finance us and take on our expense.Just think, without veterans, active duty & reservists devoting their lives to fight for this country, we would not have the freedoms that are sometimes taken for granted. These men and women have served for us, now its time to step up and help save a local organization so it can continue to help the same people that have fought to protect the freedoms that make America such a great place to call home!Please reach out to family, friends, the community and beyond.

They will freely say that our program helped save their lives. For all those years, we have relied on a church to offer us low-cost space for our offices, classroom, computer lab, clothing room, kitchen and dining area. Even though we were in someone else's space, the ladies have always said that when they come to us, they feel like they are coming home. For most of them, it is the first place where they are welcomed by people who are truly glad to see them, who love them unconditionally, and believe in their ability to become what they were created to be. We provide a full range of classes in Wiser Life Management, Job Readiness Skills, Computer Skills and Spiritual Development. Every woman is also matched with a trained mentor who serves as her personal source of encouragement and accountability throughout her year in the program and beyond. We have seen women move off public assistance and become tax-payers as they achieve careers they never thought possible. Children have been returned to their mothers' custody. Addiction has been conquered. Homes have been purchased for their families. Survival has turned to living a full life.Our graduates come back to A Hand Up to gain new skills, be role models to the new women, serve on our Board of Directors, and speak on behalf of the program in the community. Again, they call it ""coming home.""We know that now is the time to begin a capital campaign to purchase a house...to finally have a home of our own. This would also allow us to provide short-term housing for women in unique situations, preventing them from having to go to shelters. You can become part of this effort by contributing here on our gofundme page.

I was denied due to my age and that the.y think I'm trainable. However my health has become more dibilating & restricting with being unable to walk or stand very much. The medication side effects have cause more health issues. Since I was denied 3times before things became even worse. I had to get attorney to fight for me. However , the wait time for a hearing is 16 months or longer. My son case is now pending evaluation which will be another few months out. It still won't cover the cost of our house payment or if I was to rent with other bills.

We are now completely out of funds and falling behind on my first and 2nd mortgage payments. I've sold everything I could to get by till now and have no help or support from my son father as he an addict living on the streets. He could not handle our son diagnoses and needs along with his medical issues & addiction. I did what was best for my son & myself removing him from our life. In return putting stress on us of losing our home.  My son is a very happy, funny, friendly, and outgoing teenager however with his autism his needs of non verbal- limited communication, constant movement, wondering, learning disability, jumping, him making loud noises , anxiety, attachment to me & my where abouts, and not welcoming of changes has it hard to have roommates or to find different living situation which we can afford. My son is entering high school coming this fall with his friends from his class. The high school is a big enough change for him to handle in one year. We are just trying to make it so we can continue to live in our home without being put out on the streets or living out of the car. This home has more meaning to us as My son has lived his whole life in this home. this is my 1st home I purchashed as fixer upper from his grandparents who have both passed. My son really has no family on his dad side as they really have no contact or anything to do with us due to his dad drug issues. It's basically myself & my son against bills.

And wouldn't it also beniceif it helped to end climate change, yet cost no moreto build thana normal, comparable home?I am the founder andpresident of theBetter Building Institute Inc, a non-profit educational organization whose mission is to help homeowners reduce or eliminate their energy bills, mainly by boycotting fossil fuels.I believe that everyone should know how well their home performs and how they can improve it, so in 2009 I added energy efficiency to my six-year-old home-inspection businessand began offering Home Energy & Safety inspections to families intheSt. Louis metro area,including a blower-door test and consultation onhow to fixany problems. The ultimate goal, however, is ending the world's addiction to coal, oil and natural gasthrough better Energy Efficiency (EE)and replacing what's left with Renewable Energy (RE). Hopefully, thiswill also help stop global warming and climate change before it's too late.While presentingBBI's services atlocal home shows and environmental festivals I also met a lot of families who really want to build a whole new house, and are looking for ways to make it as energy-efficient as possible. Fortunately for them, we have the answer to that as well,by teaching them how to build a zero-energy, zero-carbon (and practically indesctructible) 'SuperHome', allat a moreaffordable price than you may think.But explaining how it's done is one thing - proving it with a demonstration that shows all the various techniques and is readily available to the public is another. While there are a few similar homes in the area, they're all high-end private residenceswith no public access, plus no one has used all the EE and RE technologies, especiallyin places where they are available for display or demonstration.For this reason,I am planning to build the first SuperHome Education & Demonstration (or 'SHED') Center here in the St. Louis area, to prove that indestructible net-zero homes are possible and affordable, and to teach the public themethods and materials necessary to build them. Similar in style and size to amiddle-class residence, the SHED Center willcontain at least one classroom andoffice space in lieu of bedrooms and an unfinishedbasement, allowing easy access to all the special EE and RE features for demonstration and instructional purposes.The amount of full funding isunknownat this time, aswe continue to gathermanufacturers,contractors, individual volunteersand other stakeholders who arecontributing products, materials andlabor in exchange formedia exposure or hands-on training. So for now, we only know that we need a minimum of $20,000 to acquire permits and licenses, hire a videographer to capture the building process, and spread the wordfor more stakeholders. Currently, we have commitments for about 25% of the materials, and several offers for less-than-ideal building sites, so the search continues.Perks at various donation levels include a listing of your name in our Hall of Fame for a $5 minimum donation,ora copy of the book or video that documents the SHED's construction and includes the Hall of Fame for $20 more. And for those within 50 miles of St. Louis,any $150 3-hour Home Energy & Safety Inspection ($50for eachadditional hour) is also considered a donation to the construction of the SHED.The Cleanest, Safest and Cheapest Energy is the Kind We DON'T Use!This chart shows how the energy used in the average American home is broken down. Note that 38% isused just to heat or coolthe living space, and another 32%is used for water-heating and lighting. But if we maximize EE in both cases, we can eliminate up to70% of our energy cost, leaving only 30% to be supplied by renewables, such asa few solar panels.Here'show a SuperHome can save that 70%: Starting with a strong, well-insulated outer shell is the first step, and the strongest andmost-insulated shellsarebuilt out ofICFs, or Insulated Concrete Forms. Usually made from a pair of 4-foot-longby 16""-inch tall pair of styrofoam panelsstacked like LEGO blocks and filled with rebar and concrete 4-14-inches thick,they result in an R-40+wall that can withstand up to 200 mph winds, most floods, and even minor earthquakes. Plus, since there's no wood involved, there'svery little risk of fire , mold, rot, or insect damage, while also reducing deforestation.Another advantage to ICFs is the concrete's ability toconduct heat from the ground below the frost line in the basement, which is always around 60 degrees. With no wood to leak air, this means the home's interiorcould alsostay around 60 degrees, regardless of the outside temperature. This is called passive geothermal, requiring no energy to create heat. But if necessary, extraheating and cooling can also be done passively. Solar heat conductedthrougha water and antifreeze mix from heatcollectors on the roof can bestored in a large insulated tank in the basement, and distributed through plastic tubing under the floors of the house. Likewise, air that is too warmcould rise andbe exhausted byoperable skylights (or 'cooling towers'), while being replaced by cooler fresh air allowedinvia basement 'cooling tunnels'.This arrangement couldmake a normal furnace or air-conditioner redundant,while circulatingmuniciple water through tubing coiled inside the large solar-heated water tank could also end the need for a normal water heater. By placing the kitchen, laundry and bathsclose by, we couldeven stop waiting for hot waterwhile wasting the cold.These are just a few of the many ways to reduce or eliminate energy and resource waste in a home, but it would take a book or video to describe them all (which, by the way, is the $25 perkmentioned above).Don Dieckmann, PresidentBetter Building Institute Inc.

We really feel that Hillary is the one person we can trust and that we should be listening to.The below statement was written by GW Martin and his wife. If anyone is interested in reading more on why voting no is important, here is a good explination. Lets not let the greedy few and out of state (Washington, D.C.) interests come into Maine. Lets squash this and write a proper bill for the people, by the people. We all want legalization, but not at the cost of a thriving medical program.A Call for Legislative Precedent;As U.S. citizens and lawmakers, we are all obligated to protect the integrity of our state and the health of our people. To do so, we must foster a secure economy through ensuring sustainable communities. This means it is of utmost importance that our farms and businesses are run by and for our people. We are only free when we can provide for ourselves. Keeping this in mind, the legislation necessary for lawful possession of marijuana is actually very safe and simple.The road we create for legal marijuana is still in our hands. Encouraging responsible cultivation and use will keep it an important contribution to the health of Maines people and economy. Maines homegrown marijuana has great value just like all the other quality, healthy, home grown, cultivated, crafted, hunted, fished and foraged products in our state. It would be unfair to allow the sale of marijuana before all residents have a season and opportunity to grow some for themselves, family and community; NOT FOR SALE FIRST. Until Mainers have a chance to supply themselves, talk about sales is purely speculative. If the sale of marijuana is legalized and regulated; producer to consumer restrictions and an annual dollar limit for those transactions should be set. This would be similar to the retail meat exemption our general stores use to cut up fresh meat behind the counter. By limiting the amount in dollars an organization can make, we keep the knowledge and practice in our communities. Great care is taken when growing for ones own community. Our state is known for top quality Maine homegrown throughout the northeast. It is paramount to have safeguards against deterioration of quality. Maines marijuana industry is likely to go south if we do not provide legislative protection.With businesses owned by local people in charge of divvying out our commonly-owned resources, we will ensure stability for generations to come. If we allow large out of state investors into the arena, we sell control of an asset we own. It would be akin to putting our lobstering or hunting and fishing licenses up to bid. In our past, small mills, canneries, farms, creameries, seafood processing, boat building, and firewood processing were secure ways to pass value down to our children. When we get too big and not owned by our people, we end up with Millinockets, Bucksports, Lincolns and other large corporate dependencies. If we allow our licenses to be bought and sold, our traditional marijuana industry will turn into hash oil-laced electronic cigarettes from South America; with so many regulations in the way that it becomes too costly and unrealistic for cottage industry.Cottage industry is the heart of Maines tourism income. The money and tax system is already working to collect revenue from tourism. It costs Maine nothing to produce quality marijuana; good soil, clean water, clean air, sunshine and honest people. The national marijuana policy lobbyists would like us to believe that millions of dollars in tax revenue from marijuana sales is right at our finger tips. In reality, money gets into peoples hands when the bank lends it. Marijuana gets into our peoples hands when we grow it. The bank lends in New York and some of that money arrives here through tourism. Many visitors call Maine home. Just like farm stands, roadside seafood shacks, antique shops, family reunions and yard sales; small marijuana farms are an asset Mainers and visitors can count on. When the states in southern New England muddle up their marijuana industry just like their clean natural resources, our state will be an even brighter beacon for quality, fresh, farm- raised marijuana. And so goes Maine.Some argue that legalizing non-essential use of marijuana is sending the wrong message to our children. The right message is sent when adults are allowed to make decisions about what goes into their body. Mainers are increasingly accepting of marijuana and tis the season for our government to advise safe and responsible use. Smoking is not healthy, whether it be cigarettes, pot or anything else. Excessive smoking eventually turns into a public health concern. Occasional smoking, like occasional consumption of alcohol, prescription painkillers, over processed food and so forth, can be accommodated by our bodies. People often use marijuana in forms other than smoke, including externally, with more benefit to their overall health than advertised pharmaceuticals. When it is allowed to be marketed for sale, we risk having messages that are more concerned about profits than wellness. Our alcohol and tobacco history shows decades of marketing not in the interest of public health. After giant class action lawsuits and damage done, we realize that profit-guided marketing needs to be curbed; thats why cigarette commercials were banned from public access television.As growers, we often see the plant replace alcohol, tobacco and opiate dependency. Marijuana treats addiction with outstanding success in two profound stages. The first is when used as a sedative to bear withdrawal symptoms. The second stage is when the marijuana itself is being quit or reduced to occasional use. Withdrawal symptoms from marijuana are much less severe than those from the initial chemical addiction. Just as it was described to kids in the DARE program, marijuana can be a gateway drug; it can be a gateway out. In some cases, years go by until the individual feels strong enough to take the last step. That is time spent dependent on an organic product produced here in the state, which if grown thriftily, has not cost our people anything but their time.The herbaceous plant known as Marijuana is easy for people to grow for themselves, their friends, families and communities. A growing number of people are using marijuana because they find it safer and more effective than other medicines, without the dangerous side effects. Unlike consuming pharmaceuticals and even coffee, marijuana users are able to supply themselves locally, without exhausting their financial resources or inducing social or environmental harm through importation. These benefits should be esteemed by our state, not flattened by false, exaggerated propaganda used to incriminate our hardworking and honest citizens.Law enforcements willingness to conduct raids, based on Department and Agency rules that have not been overseen by a legislative body, has dire consequences. It triggers preying upon weak, fearful and defenseless marijuana users and growers. Law enforcement wants to be on the laws side but the right law has to be there for them to enforce. While precedent and case law are set by a few, the practice of rules made by the unelected being enforced with well-trained military style home invasions (seize, search, interrogate, and summons later) creeps into other unreviewed administrative rules. As long as departments have an open window to blame the federal government for major substantive rules that had no legislative oversight, law enforcement tactics will also remain out of our control. We have been told by law enforcement If you dont like the rules, talk to your legislature. Who is to blame when one of those raids finds a dying vet making his last stand? When law enforcement guns down one of our farmers, they will blame lawmakers.The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution aims to resolve divisions between citizens and law enforcement, before damage in the state incurs. We are counted on by the people of fellow states to keep our room clean and hold our own. It is time to deliver lawful possession to all adults. It is also time to amend subsection 8074 of our State Administrative Procedures Act to provide accountability for every law.respectively or to the people,                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Buena Vista Horror Club,"$1,919","$2,750",Community," September 2, 2016",33,22,SAN DIEGO,CA,281000,,2,"                            Gabriel Orbit                                                                                                                   SAN DIEGO, CA                                                        Veryfewhomes decorate or give candy to trick or treaters in Mexico due to the economy and Halloween being over-shadowed by the Dia de los Muertos holiday that is observed on November 2nd. The children are aware that theres Halloween excitement across North America, but barely get to participate.In 2004, we decided to start a small Halloween yard display in Tijuana to encourage the kids in the area to come out and trick or treat. As word spread that there was a house giving out candy on Halloween night, we went from a few dozen kids thatfirst year to 200 the following year! As years went by, the number of kids kept growing and we kept adding props and dcor to make the yard display more elaborate (and lots more candy)!We always thought it would be cool to do a haunted house scare maze for them, so in 2012 we took the leap and did our very first walk-through. It consisted of black fabric,plastic sheets and a handful of friends volunteering as scare actors. The kids loved it and we had over 700 people walk through our scare maze that Halloween night.Oh the feeling of seeing the trick or treaters and parentsgoing through the maze, getting a few good scares and receiving trick-or-treat candy for making it through.What a a special sensation to say the least...we were hooked! Word continued to spread beyond the neighborhood, growing attendance even more. We were soon drawing children from several of the city's surrounding neighborhoods...We made acommitmentto make the experience biggerand betterfor them each year, dedicating a lot of time into researching and learningdifferentbuilding, haunt design and prop making techniques through specialized online forums, tutorials, industry convention workshop's and how-tos.In 2014, we transitioned from fabric and plastic sheets to using lumber and real building materials for the construction of themaze as well asadding scenery, sound, lighting and security cameras.Last year, 8 volunteers helped on the construction of the maze (which took about a six weeks). We traveled from San Diego most weeknights and every weekend to prepare the structure and set design. On Halloween night, we had20 scare actors andover 1,200 people came through our maze....and continuing with our tradition,everyone got their equal bounty of candy regardless of age! All of this has always been (and always will be)absolutely free of charge to anyone that wants to come and visit our haunt.The cost of building andrunningthis project has previously beenfunded by me and assisted by the invaluable help that friends and family provide by volunteering theirtime, talent anddedication.This is our way of contributing to the community and creating lifelong memories for both kids and adults. Do you remember the excitement of Halloween? Many of us still remember the thrill of discovering a home haunton our trick or treat runs. The ability to create those feelings in hundreds of other people each year is indescribably rewarding (not to mention, the thrill of doing the actual scaring!)As the number of people that come to our haunt increases each year, unfortunately, my personal income and budget cant keep up with the scope of the event. Thats why we are hoping to harness the power of crowdfunding. Our goal of an additional $2,750 USD will cover the shortfall, allowing us to purchase the extra buildingmaterials, tools, paint, lighting/sound, costumes, make-upand candy needed to support the number of people that we expect this year.Can you help us provide the kids in Tijuana another safe and HAPPY HALLOWEEN? Theres no minimum or maximum pledge limits. Please feel free to contribute as much as you are financially comfortable doing.

For 20+ years she served the small town community of Marathon, NY, not just as the town physician and the overseeing School Physician through the Family Health Network, but also as an involved community member.The Marathon Community wish to honor Dr. Hurley for her many years of going above and beyond for the community, by raising funds to build a stone garden wall in her name, around the Village Green Gazebo to replace the old wooden logs holding in the Gazebo landscaping beds. The wall will carry a plaque honoring Dr. Hurley, and for generations to come continue to hold the many plants donated to the existing landscaping beds by many of Dr. Hurley's patients. You may wonder: Why the gazebo? It is simple; Not only has Dr Hurley given to the Gazebo but The Gazebo is also at the heart of our community, just as Dr. Hurley were for so many years, and because she held our community,and it's people in her heart! What better place to honor her!But not only was she our town physician, she was also a huge community supporter. - For example: Moved by the tragic news of a fire in Connecticut that in the early '90ties cost the lives of multiple firefighters due to their inability to communicate effectively during the fire, Dr. Hurley took it upon herself to donate a large amount of her own money to the Marathon Fire Department to ensure, that our local firefighters would have proper equipment to prevent this from happening to them. Over the years, she has also been a big supporter of our Library amongst many other community organizations and individuals. However, not many know about her giving spirit, as she always goes about it quietly, never seeking a spotlight for herself.In honor of Dr. Hurley, community members are encouraged to share their own personal stories of Dr. Hurley and to help raise funds to build a new, stronger garden wall to honor her in the heart of our community, as she held our community and its residents in her heart for so many years.Happy retirement, Dr. Hurley, and thank you for caring so deeply about us and our community for so many years!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Nick's Journey to Independence,$815,"$20,000",Community," September 24, 2016",10,1,WILMINGTON,DE,59000,,1,"                            Maggie Elaine                                                                                        on behalf of Lucy GrahamWILMINGTON, DE                                Nick's StoryMy name is Maggie, and all my life I have looked up to my cousin Nick. Our relationship has always been special, mostly because Nick is unable to communicate with words. He lives with non-verbal Autism, meaning he cannot speak at all. I have watched this pose many challenges for my Aunt, Uncle, and cousin, Nick's awesome sister Sara. When Nick was diagnosed with Autism at the age of 3, services were minimal. His parents moved forward relentlessly with what did exist; therapies, special glasses, communication devices, you name it,were called upon to help Nick communicate. They moved across the country just so he could have the Delaware Autism program, which ended up a good fit. Even Sara, a high schooler at the time, made the sacrifice for her brother. Once he was 21, he graduated from the program. That means once again, my Aunt and Uncle were left to piece something together for Nick's independent adult life.With a job coach, Nick is able to volunteer at a food bank. But a paying job, although they tried, is out of the question for Nick. He has learned skills so that he can help others and be as independent as possible, but these will not be financially lucrative. Volunteering gives his life purpose, but does not supplement his social security enough to pay for the quality support people he needs around the clock.How You Can Help!Something that sets Autism apart from many folks with special needs is that it is not life shortening. Nick's parents know that he will outlive them, so long term planning is absolutely crucial. I thought it was time to create a fund to not only support Nick, but his parents who have devoted the last 28 years of their life to Nick's health, independence, and happiness. Although health care is taken care of, daily costs, routine living expenses, and costs related to Nick's Crohn's Disease are essential for him to continue living happily.Fortunately, his job coach and dear friend Joey has agreed to live with Nick and care for him in the condo his parents, Lucy and Dave Graham, have taken a mortgage out for (that's right, they now have two mortgages!). Nick needs people around him that understand how he communicates- through pictures. Joey not only understands Nick and his needs related to his Autism, but also his Crohn's Disease. Crohn's is a disease that impacts the intestines and causes indigestion and other bowel issues. Because Nick can't communciate, you can imagine how important a friend like Joey is to have around.

What They Need: Extensive work to their convent building to remediate mold throughout their chapel, kitchen and living quarters, as well as insulate the space under their home. The dollar amount includes remediating mold in the attic and possibly having to replace the roof in the process.Who They Are:They are a small Orthodox Christian convent that has been a part of the Stanwood and surrounding communities for the past 17 years. The sisters are known throughout the area for their genuine, committed lifestyle and hard work, and can always be recognized by their traditional nun's habits. Attending their annual Christmas open house, which is held at their candle shop on the convent grounds, has become a beloved tradition for many people.Why Should You Help?:Regardless of your religious beliefs, the annual activities at the convent's open house during the Christmas season providesfamilies an opportunity to see how beeswax candles are made and to shop in a peaceful atmosphere like our grandparents used to do. It is a way to show support fora unique memberof the StanCam community and give back to the sisters who've been supporting and praying for our community formany years.The Convent of the Meeting of the Lord:Almost two decades ago, a small group of nuns were sent from their home convent in Boston to start a life of service to God and their communityin rural Washington State. With Boston being the only home they had known, life out in rural Stanwood was quite an adjustment for the sisters!Because ofthe kindness of the local community residents, it didn't take long for the sisters to develop a love for this area and now consider it their home.Every year, the sisters look forward to opening their gift shop doors to the community during the holidays to spend time teaching the art of candle-making and meeting with old friends, whilemaking new ones.Visiting the Quiet Light Candles shop on the convent grounds during the holidays has become a local tradition for many area families. Every year, children get the opportunity to make their own beeswax candles, while parents look for gifts and visit with the sisters working in the shop. It has always been a very popular event for the community and provides families with an alternative to crowded chain stores during the holiday shopping season.For the past 17 years, children from surrounding communities have enjoyed visiting the little candle shop on the convent grounds during the Christmas season. Free home-made cookies for all who come are an added bonus!In a hectic world of crowdedchain stores, the convent's Quiet Light Candles shop is a pleasant and peaceful shopping experience for people of all ages.Making your own beeswax candle has been a fun experience for children and adults while visiting the convent's candle shop.Every year, the sisters at the conventopen their doors to spend time with those that share the community they call ""home.""Visiting the convent each year is becoming a family tradition for many families.Each year, people of all faiths visit the convent's candle shop to enjoy the peaceful environment whileshopping for beeswax candles.Quiet Light Candles is located in one of the buildings on the convent grounds and its true purpose is to support the sisters in their life of prayer. The convent survives solely by the work of their own hands through online candle sales and from unsolicited donations. Making money is never a goal for the sisters, as their focus is on serving the Lord and offering up prayers for others. Their days are spent in worship in the chapel, pouring beeswax candles, working with the community, and answering the many prayer requests they receive on a daily basis.The sisters create pure beeswax candles in order to support themselves and to provide the community with a clean, environmentally healthy candle option.Humans aren't the only ones who enjoy visiting with the sisters.As a volunteer for Quiet Light Candles , I recently found out that the Abbess received bad news regarding their convent when inspections revealed that the building had some serious mold issues, which has also been affecting their health.  Since the mold is in the attic and multiple other unseen locations throughout the convent, it went undetected for many years. It was only after the sisters were forced to address ongoing chronic health issues that they discovered that wide-spread mold issues were the root cause. According to the National Capital Poison Control Center, living in a building infected with mold causes a number of respiratory and other health problems as occupants unknowingly breathe in mold spores. Here is the link to the National Poison Control to learn more about the dangers of mold in your homes, schools, offices etc. http://www.poison.org/articles/2011-oct/mold-101-effects-on-human-health The large amount of mold in the convent requires professional remediation to make the building safe for occupation, and this work is very costly. The sisters at the Convent of the Meeting of the Lord do not have the kinds of funds necessary to remove the mold, or another place to live, and have been praying for Gods help in this matter. By making a donation to this GoFundMe site, we can be the answer to those humble prayers! Right now, the sisters have had to split up and cannot occupy the convent building itself, until the mold is removed throughout the building. With our help, we can replace the convents mold-infested attic and crawl space, along with several other areas, to make it safe for the sisters to return to their life of prayer and various labors.Throughout the years, many types of animals have also enjoyed life at the convent. The chickens provides eggs forthe sisters and in return, the chickens get to live a peacefuland free-range life on the convent grounds. Sometimes, they even wander into the convent to say hello!The candle workshop is a busy place, especially in preparation for the holiday season.Not only do the sisters sell candles to the public, but they provide candles to other churches as well.It takes so little from each one of us to accomplish a big thing! With all the recent acts of violence towards others throughout the world, we can prove that gestures of love, kindness and generosity are still more plentiful than acts of hate. It doesnt matter what your religious or spiritual beliefs are, if youve taken the time to read this page, youve already shown you have a good heart and you can make a difference. Lets get the Sisters back to their convent so they can continue their prayers for the world.The Sisters are eager to get back to their daily worship at their chapel in the convent. We can make that happen!Though the Sisters do not solicit donations, they are aware of this GoFundMe page on their behalf and know that they will receive 100% of the funds donated here. You will know that your donations have made a difference when the convent is once again being used for prayer and filled with voices giving praise to God. I will post pictures of the work your donations have made possible so you can see that one person's generosity can make a difference in the lives of others. Follow the Sisters' journey back to their convent on this page as updates will be posted regularly.You can also visit the convents online candle shop if you would like to purchase hand-made, 100% pure beeswax candles. All proceeds from purchases will go to help the convent as well. Please share the candle shop link with friends and family too! http://www.quietlightcandles.com/The Sisters have spent decades perfecting the art of creating pure beeswax candles. They began to learn their craft when they were at their original convent in Boston, and between them have over 75 years of experience in beeswax candle making. The Small Convent with Big DreamsThe sisters currently combine their chapel, along with living quarters,under one roof that is too small to hold them all. They also use a room within the pole barn as one of the sisters living quarters, as well as a small RV on the property. Though modest by society's standards, the sisters'ultimate dream would be to find a place on which they could build several small, energy-efficient cabins, with a chapel and workshop on the grounds. Quiet, purity and simplicity are at the heart of all they do. When I spoke withthe Abbess about their dream, she replied, ""If God were to open the door to be able to start fresh, utilizing all wehave learned over the years regarding healthy building decisions, it would be ourhope that then other like-minded women, seeking a life of quiet prayer and living simply, would be able to join us.""For their sake, and that of their community, I hope that day comes. In the meantime, given the reality of their present circumstances, let's do our best to help them get re-settled and back to their prayer life!My name is Karin Lien and I have been foturnate to volunteer with the Sisters at the Convent of the Meeting of the Lord in Stanwood, WA for over a year now. Seeing their spiritual devotion and their connection to their community, I felt compelled to start this GoFundMe page on their behalf, as they wouldn't even know about this possibility or ask for it for themselves. They spend their energies praying and helping others and it would be great if we can do the same for them. Because they are a small convent, endeavoring to support themselves by hard work and their handicrafts--according to Orthodox monastic tradition--it is a blessing to have this opportunity to help them. I have watched their daily struggles as medical bills grew ever larger, and now the extensive work on the mold remediation is way beyond what they can earn from candle sales alone. Despite all these health and financial challenges, their faith in God is unshakable. I'm hoping that we can show the Sisters of the Convent of the Meeting of the Lord that there are good, caring people out in the world of all faiths and backgrounds and that we are willing to help.Thank you for any amount you can afford to share!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Flowers & Such: Boston Bike Lanes,"$6,720","$7,000",Community," September 8, 2015",180,12,BOSTON,MA,548000,1,3,"                            Jonathan Fertig                                                                                                                   BOSTON, MA                                                        I'm Jonathan.

They put a boot on my store!Marcus Books of San Francisco EvictedDear Supporters: It was difficult to know what to tell you about our struggle to stay in our building, its winding path of lawyers and judges and protests and promises, hopes and gravities made it difficult to report our status on a curved road. But the current property owner has changed the locks to the door of 1712 Fillmore Street.Marcus Books missed a couple of rent payments (not such a rare thing considering that at the same time the largest US banks and even our government asked taxpayers to give them hundreds of billions of dollars of assistance). However, the mortgage holder, PLM Lender, foreclosed on the building that housed Marcus Books of San Francisco since 1981. It was sold to the Sweis family (realtors and owners of Royal Taxi in San Francisco). The Johnson family (co-owners of Marcus Books of San Francisco) has been trying to buy the building back for a year and half. The Sweis' bought this building in a bankruptcy ""auction"" (apparently, they were the only bidder) for $1.6 million. The Johnsons offered $1.8 million; the Sweis set their price at $3.20 million, hoping to double their purchase price after a few months ownership. After some public outrage resulting in public protests against the Sweis, a negotiation brought their asking price down to $2.6 million, adding a million dollar profit to their purchase without adding any improvements to the property and adding a stipulation that the entire $2.6 million be raised within 90 days.Marcus Books supporters, including the local chapter of the NAACP; ACCE (Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment; Japantown activists; Westside Community Services; Julian Davis, our fearless legal council; Carlos Levexier's ""Keep It Lit"" campaign committee; local literary community including writers and other bookstores; people from all over the world: friends, family, customers, churches and unions took a stand against the bulldozing of community. Individuals, unions, and churches donated $25,000. The Community Land Trust of San Francisco garnered loan pledges of $200,000 and Westside Community Services offered a loan of $1.60 million. Though by any standards that would have been more than enough for a down payment, the Sweiss' refused the $1.85 million start and filed for eviction.Concurrently, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution requiring every division of city government make it a priority that they each use their ""powers"" to help Marcus Books stay in its location. In addition, and after 5 years of efforts by John Templeton (the leader in Black California history), and Greg Johnson (co-owner of Marcus Books of San Francisco), London Breed and Malia Cohen, two San Francisco Supervisors, initiated the Board of Supervisors' unanimous vote granting landmark status.With the numerous speeches of San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee stating his commitment to righting the wrongs of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency's slaughter of the thriving African American Fillmore District, we at Marcus Books believed the City would take some affirmative action on our behalf, since Marcus Books is the only surviving Black business since the Redevelopment devastation. Maybe that support is around the next bend? Well the locks have been changed, the cavalry is not in sight, and it's time to pack up the books and store them till we find another space.You might ask yourself, why bother? Materialism rules the day. That is not news. More often than not, we take it for granted that the ""bottom line"" is the only line worth respecting, though it respects no one. This is a common conception, but not right. Right is the vertical line that runs through all levels: from its spiritual top to its earthly roots. This verticality is manifested only by integrity. Integrity defies gravity in its perpetual longing for truth. Millions of people have been put out of their homes by bottom-line-feeders. It's common, but it's not okay, now or at any other time. Sometimes you just have to take a stand. Integrity is a verb.In 1970, I had a vision bout rebirth. A segment of that vision informs this struggle. In this particular scene, the spirit is climbing the Tree of Humanity, being lifted higher and higher by those entwined in The Tree. The spirit never steps on anyone's face or heart. It just carries their dreams up with it. Because it is growing towards rebirth, it gets younger with each step up. Though there are thousands of supporters at the bottom of The Tree, there are fewer at the top and the helping hands are fewer and far between. At the top of The Tree, at the stratum of the clouds, quantity has morphed in into quality. Here a storm of wind and rain rages, lightning strikes and a mad dog spirals up The Tree, snapping at the heels of the now, infant spirit. Teetering on a limb, the spirit sees a man face down in the mud at the bottom of The Tree. Seems he got there from letting go of his faith in The Tree. The surrounding clouds urge the spirit fall.""Cross Section""The rumors, that were whispered, Here, the silence screams, And branches battle shadows To defend their dreams. Where Black is cut in pieces, Can't hold myself together. Time cuts me down, Life me brought up, But lead me to this weather. The Time says, ""Fall To soulless ease. To struggle is disgrace. The gravity will grant you peace, And hide your shameful face.' But I am born of honor: Descendent from above. My Father's name is Wisdom And my Mother's name is Love. And I have strength of purpose. That's what my climb's about. As I'm cut off, I will hold ON And trustingly Black-out.""(Copyright 1997, Karen Johnson) For the hundreds of people who have lent their time, money, and prayers, we are truly grateful.--Tamiko, Greg, and Karen Johnson, co-owners Marcus Books of San Francisco . . . to be continuedWe will rise again in San Francisco                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help buy & protect Back Shore Land!,"$102,156","$100,000",Community," February 25, 2016",393,7,GLOUCESTER,MA,1900,1,7,"                            Martin Del Vecchio                                                                                        on behalf of Stephen MeltzerGLOUCESTER, MA                                Important Update: This campaign has changed!

Ive been studying climate change and developing an understanding of how to addressthese problems. There is a different way to look at it: We think of humans as a scourge on this planet, but humans are capable of being agents of ecological repair and rebuilding. I used to think that CO2 in the atmosphere was just pollution with nowhere to go, but it does have a place it can go: Soil is the main storage of carbon on land. There are techniques that are already known, understood, and practiced which show us that we can replenish these storages of soil carbon:Earthworks: ponds, swales, drains, and well-designed roads collect, hold, and infiltrate water, improving the capacity of the soil to support life. These can be aspects of both rural and urban developments.Vegetation: food forests, perrenial grasses, and oases collect CO2 and make sugars and proteins that are pumped into the soil. These systems can grow food and materials, and create products for market.Microorganisms: Fungi, bacteria, nemotodes, protozoa, and earthworms can be analyzed and then enhanced through good compost practices. They convert these carbohydrates and proteins into complex long-storage soil organic matter and enhance the growth of the plants.Im launching the World Tree, a design firm focused on these techniques, which will grow into a worker-owned cooperative capable of addressing and reversing climate change.When our country experienced drought and soil-loss in the 1930s, the government created opportunities for unemployed Americans to dig in and repair the damage. Without that kind of leadership today, we have to figure this out for ourselves. We will put people to work on earth-repair, in ways that are democratic and collaborative, and at a living wage. We will design productive farms, residences, and urban infrastructure, all that intentionally sequester carbon in rich, fertile, soil.We need your help to plant the seed and start the World Tree.This first phase is this $2,600 request for support to get a video and a high-quality campaign going;The second phase will begin within the next fewmonths: Raising $15 - 30k for the project launch putting together research and development, making presentations, hosting workshops and seminars, developing a strong pitch, and designing flagship projects;Within two years, we will make our pitch to several sustainable business incubators with a clear, researched plan, presentation, and written works.Help make the World Tree happen.$5, $10, $20, $100, or $500, whatever you can give is going to help.Any amount is so appreciated and brings us closer to our $2,600 flexgoal for this phase. We hope to raise the funds over the next couple weeks so that we can get moving on this work.If you donate, I'll keep you up to date on the progress. I'll use a private blog and invite all of those who contribute...If we collaborate, we can fix the climate crisis in our lifetime. Let's start now!Please help to spread the word.Thank you sincerely,Jordan Fink, founder of World Tree.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help me build a community ,"$5,058","$25,000",Community," July 18, 2014",164,26,COLUMBUS,OH,2300,,69,"                            Jesse Macbeth                                                                                                                   COLUMBUS, OH                                                        I purchased land in Gerogiato build a community. The purpose of this community is to make a independant black owned and operated economy and a safe place for peopleof all backgrounds to raise and educate their children. On this land we will build homes, stores, farms, schools, medical facilities, etc.Alkebulan Community is a group of black and muslim people who are simply tired of living in a society that has been built on oppressing and killing people who look like us. The community is made up of many people with different belief systems, education, and socio-economic backgrounds, that are coming together for one common goal. That goal is to start creating a independent communities so we can advance and protect ourselves and our own self-interests. We exist to undue centuries of brainwashing and the negative influence of the dominant society, and to influence our people of African descent to separate, gain economic freedom, and use our power to create revolutionary change. We also welcome people of all racial backgrounds who are tired of living in a system that was designed to put one race above the other. our mission is to live in harmony and to fight a common enem together. We will not turn away someone because of the color of their skin. If we did that we would be no better then the people and the system we want to seperate from. It dont matter what your racial background is if you feel the same way as us then you are welcome. We our a african centered community and most of our events and education will be centered on teaching and reconnecting our people who have lost their identy due to centuries of slavery and oppression in this country.We now have to ask ourselves, ""How do we change the equation?"" We have to be the leaders that are needed. We have to step up and force change. No one is going to come and save us. We have to save ourselves. Now we are taking steps to do just that, because we have to unite in order to survive. Our people have been beaten down and destroyed and it is up to us to present a different option. We are building the promise land and paving the way for others to follow our lead. When we have been successful, when Alkebulan has risen from the ashes and its light is shining in all the darkest places that our people dwell, you will see something in our peoples eyes.Something that is beyond dangerous to our oppressors. Something that cannot be beaten out of us as long as we stand strong, and something that will change the hearts and minds of our people. That is hope at the end of a very long and dark tunnel. Hope that stirs the soul and awakens those that have long been asleep. Every morning I wake up and I see something on the horizon. I see past the bloody battlefield. The strewn and mutilated bodies of those who have fallen. Our people who are victims of so many evils that have befallen our people. The vision that is enveloped by golden rays of life-giving sun light is Alkebulan. Through Alkebulan our freedom is waiting.

The yearly cost of our nature based field trips is $10,000. This includes two field trips per month to Blissful Dreams at Tuxbury Farm on the Wando River where we ride and groom horses, do farm chores, have nature walks, make nature inspired art, engage in river play and have picnic lunches. This would also include one Ecotour per month by Barrier Island Eco Tours. Being outdoors is an important experience for our well being and HEART's population needs it more than most. We see significant positive results from our members after having spent time immersed in nature.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPSome people know HEART was recently forced to restructure in order to comply with existing South Carolina state law governing services to special needs adults. Basically, the system and laws are not set up for small creative day programs like HEART. I'm grateful to have been made aware of this law, but it forced us to alter our plans on how to operate and raise money to support our ongoing services to our HEART members. We had to end our Hearts Handmade micro-business and employment program which produced income to support our services. Just before this change, we had purchased a HEART van to ease transportation stress and make it easier to get HEART members out into the community and into nature for art and therapy. HEART was awarded a $5,000 grant from the Bakker Family Fund and we used it as a down payment for our van. Our monthly payment and insurance is $650. With gas, maintenance, and stipends for the farm and ecotours-- the yearly cost of our nature based field trips is just over $10,000.Please support us-- we cannot do it without you!We were invited to apply for the Medical Society of South Carolina (MSSC) grant again this year. We were awarded $5,000 from them last year for general operating expenses and are applying this year for a $10,000 grant to be used to pay off the van if we receive it. ++++++++++++++++++++HEART Artist Guild & Theatre Company is a family of multi-media and performing artists for adults (21+) with special needs. People with developmental and other disabilities are often segregated and discounted by the public. Difficulties in communications, people skills and other restraints make it difficult for interaction and independent living. At HEART we believe that every individual is able to contribute a unique viewpoint on life and should have the opportunity to express that vision through art and theatre. Providing an inclusive space, art materials, and the mentorship by professional artists allows for creative expression, independence, dignity, and community integration.MISSION: To provide an innovative art and theatre community that promotes creative expression, independence, dignity and community integration for adults with disabilities.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Vandals Won't Win!,$450,$350,Community," July 30, 2016",8,1,MEADVILLE,PA,32000,,,"                            Sarah Pfleger Medvec                                                                                        on behalf of Jason SakalMEADVILLE, PA                                                        A vandal throw a rock thru Jason's car's rear window.

She continued to be the central place of gathering when the WWII Filipino-American veterans assumed her care from the aging farmers. She has been around for about 70 years, and now she needsa lotof tender loving care.Magellan Hall, located at 8831 Gerber Road, Sacramento, CA 95828, is currently the gathering place for the American Legion Filipino-American Veterans of Post 604. The Hall was built by Filipino farmers in the 1940s. It wascalled Farmers Hall before it became Magellan Hall when the aging farmers sold it to the WWII Filipino-American veterans.Since the Hall was built in the 1940s, there are now many challenges to keep it open for the veterans and the civilian community as a gathering place.We have problems with stained ceilings because ofa leaky roof during the rainy winter season, warped flooring, plumbing and sewage,temperamental HVAC system, gravel parking lot which makes it hard for the elderly to walk or be wheeled from their vehicle.Thedonated fundswill be used by theveterans to hireprofessionals to bring the facility up to American With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) standards so thatshe may serve the communityin additional ways such as providing a polling location or hosting large gatherings for seniors.Getting the renovations done to meet ADA requirements will ensure her continuedservice to the veteran and civilian communities. Magellan Hallis the legacy of our manongs and tatangs (elderly brothers and fathers) from the 1940s farming industry and also the WWII Pinoy (Filipino)veterans. She is priceless and shedeserves our attention and care. It is getting harder for the aging veterans to meet the costly maintenance and operationsrequired to keep her presentable.If or when we canrenovate to meet ADA standards, the veteranscan attract more events to help monetarily in meeting the monthlymaintenanceand utility costs.The continued existence ofMagellan Hall is important not only to the veterans but also tothe community, especially those families who can relate to the challenges and sacrifices faced by veterans.A 21st century renovation of Magellan Hall will allow us tooffer more to veterans as well as the community .

We are urging you to help us get our new building ready in as little as two weeks so that we can begin moving in on September 1, 2016. Our current lease expires August 31. Studio space requires walls to be built, floors and mirrors and barres to be installed and many man hours of moving. The costs of floors, mirrors and barres are not cheap, and we have very little resources outside of tuition to pay for our buildout for the brand new studios at the Pelham Promenade. This location is very family-friendly and we know you all will enjoy this location much, much more! Any size contribution will be greatly appreciated!!! In return, you will benefit from all that we hope to bring to the arts and the children of our area. GoFundMe joins you in supporting the arts in Pelham through Grebel Dance. Every little bit helps to provide space for dance classes for students over the summer. Many summer students are on scholarships and reduced rates, and we need your help to continue providing the needs for this valuable experience in their lives. Please Share! Why should you support these aspiring and talented dancers and the Grebel Dance studio?For 14 years, GREBEL DANCE has made invaluable contributions to our community.

His extraordinary resume includes: Ballet Marquis de Cuevas in Paris; Roland Petit Ballet in Paris, Guest Artist at the Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow; principal dancer in the National Ballet of Washington DC; dance partner with famous ballerinas Sonia Arova, Ludmilla Tcherina, Rosella Hightower, and others. He collaborated with Nureyev and Balanchine. He studied with the famous Russian ballet master Alexander Pushkin (also teacher of Baryshnikov and Nureyev). Stevans warm-hearted teaching and ex- perience is incomparable. Deborah Grebel has degrees in dance performance and dance physiology, as well as a Masters in Education.

These are just some of the contributions GREBEL DANCE has made to our community. Like all cultural and educational programs of value, GREBEL DANCE needs corporate and individual benefactor support.

After few pictures she asked me if she could see it and asked to take few more. What a diva :)She lives on the meagre sum she earns by begging.

Ban gun sales to perpetrators of domestic violence and restrictweapons for those who assault a spouse or family member. Ban the sale of assault and military grade weapons and ammo to nonmilitarycivilians. Impose heavy penalties against those who sell weapons to buyers whodidnt pass the background check. Give the CDC permission and funding to collect data on gun violenceand its consequences. Require licensing with gun safety training before purchasing weapons.

Katy Makerspace is open to all ages and experience levels, from kids just getting interested in robotics to seasoned woodworkers willing to share their skills.We initially focussed on building the maker community and paid all of the bills through my husband's other business in computer support. However, earlier this year his biggest client was bought by a large corporation, ending that contract which meant we no longer had enough each month to pay for the makerspace and still support our family. We needed to get the makerspace to make its own money in order to keep the doors open and the lights onso we restructured our membership, started offering classes and started selling things in our online store. Our membership has beensteadily growing and it seems our efforts have put us in the right direction.Unfortunately, after draining our savings and maxing out our credit, we still fell behind and now face losing everything. We need $3500 by the end of this monthor the makerspace will be evicted and all of our tools and equipment insidewill be lost to auction. We have several efforts in action to raise this money but thought we might ask the community for some additional help.If you support the idea of a place where you can create anything while learning new skills and making new friends, please help us avoid eviction. Your support will be immenselyappreciated- not by just us but by all of the aspiring makers in Katy.Now, I know the next question is, ""Can we keep the space open after we reach our goal?"" Well, if our membership keeps growing then the answer is a resounding yes. We built this makerspace for you, the community, and its continued success depends on you!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help keep us together ,$205,"$3,000",Community," September 19, 2016",4,6,HART,MI,106000,1,18,"                            Leslie Zimmerman                                                                                                                   HART, MI                                My husband, my 2 fur babies and I are homeless, we currently are crashing at a friends house until we can get our own space.

Being the bread winner and only income, this quickly lead to homelessness. I have been cleaning, selling old unwanted items given to me from friends and family, using Facebook, letgo, and poshmark, just to feed my fur babies and keep gas in the car. I however am also not in the best health. I am tired, I need medical attention and possible procedures, unsure if I will ever be able to work a normal job again.I suffer from major depression and PTSD from childhood. Debilitating migraines, chronic diarrhea ( under investigation for Crohn's), diabetes, high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, and low potassium; due to The diarrhea ( this makes me extremely tired and legs and feet very swollen and painful. Some days I can not get out of bed)The only thing that has saved me from the dark demon of depression is my fur babies. They know when I am having a bad day. They lay with me in bad all day when I can't get up and lick away my tears when I cry. I owe them a happy life and safe place to run and play, because they have saved mine. They will never give up on me and in turn I refuse to give up on them.We are safe for now but can not crash at a friends forever. My ultimate goal is to make sure my babies are Fed, have their own space, enough space to run as Na'Nook is a big guy and loves to play:), and a roof over our heads so we are all safe and no longer have to worry. Also, eventually would love to take in a few rescue babies.I also would like to start my eBay resale business to maintain or place and the bills that will come with it.

Most of you reading this probably know me and how passionate I am about all things that have to do with my son, Brannon. For those of you that don't know...Brannon is autistic. He is a senior in high school and has been involved in the Wagoner Special Olympics for four years now. Special Olympics has been a wonderful social outlet for him. He has grown tremendously in his confidence and abilities since starting the program. All of the Special Olympic Athletes are amazing kids. They struggle everyday with things most of us take for granted, and the truth is most of them do it without much complaint. They have just accepted this as part of their lives. I've watched these athletes give every ounce of energy and courage they have just to finish and come in last. And, you know what, I was in tears and so proud of them. They were just as excited about last place as the ones that got first. It's all about cheering each other on and supporting each other. There is no ""Im better than you"" or ""I'm gonna kick your butt."" If you've never been to a Special Olympic event, you should experience it at least once. It will change your life.Here is the tough part. Just like with every other sport, it takes money. It's about $100 per kid just to go to the State Olympics...that doesn't include any local events. Wagoner Special Olympics is run by the Wagoner Special Education department thru Wagoner Public Schools. However, it is not funded by the school. There is very little grant money available anymore. So, that means it runs mostly on fundraising/donations. Yes, us parents do what we can too. But, you have to remember that special needs children tend to already have extra costs associated with them ie doctor's visits, therapies, medications, equipment, etc. Most families are already stretched pretty thin.I decided to set up this gofundme account as a mom who is trying to help. This is NOT an official fundraiser by the school or the Wagoner Special Olympics. This is just me trying to get money for these kids that so deserve it. I will the give this money to the Wagoner Special Olympics. I know it's hard for people to go to fundraisers and sometimes they just don't want to do whatever the event is. This way you don't actually have to attend anything or if you live out of town and want to donate but can't get to Wagoner, this is a way to help us.These kids deserve a sport to participate in too. Wagoner is the land of the Bulldogs and these kids are Bulldogs too! Please, help show your support for them. ANY amount is appreciated.

The course's elevation and beauty distinguishes it from other Phoenix, golf courses. Homeowners purchased in Club West to be a part of a unique lifestyle with a first class, high end golf course serving as its focal point. In January, 2016, the owner of the golf course listed it for sale claiming that the high city water costs made it difficult to make a profit. The owner pays about $700,000/year for city water. In early June, 2016, in an effort to save operating expense, he severely cut back watering to the course. The HOA Board filed a lawsuit to force the owner to water the course sufficiently. Then, on August 23rd, the City turned the water off because the owner didnt pay the water bill. Two days later, the owner paid the water bill and the water was turned back on. Because fall over seeding is scheduled to begin in about three weeks, a hearing that was scheduled for August 30th was cancelled. On August 26, the golf course owner filed an answer and counterclaim. The HOA lawsuit could take years to resolve and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees according to the HOA attorney, and a desirable outcome is not guaranteed. In the meantime, it unlikely that the course will get better and likely that the home values will suffer. Save Club West believes the homeowners should lead an urgent campaign to recover the centerpiece of our community before irreversible damage is done.We were unable to raise enough money to intervene in the lawsuit. A decision was made to focus our efforts on:1.  Investigating/facilitating economical water sources for the course.2. Researching and promoting new golf course ownership options.3. Developing a plan to restore the course to its original condition. 4. Attempting to monitor and report on the lawsuit as best we can. Save Club West is working hard to accomplish a tremendous amount with only a few volunteers, funded only by your donations. We urgently need your help to continue our fight to Save Club West. Your financial support is vital to our success.DISCLAIMER: Save Club has not been, cannot, and will not be representing the homeowners in the HOA lawsuit.

This unincorporated community, known as Sandbranch, is now home to over 80 people. It is only 14 miles south-east of Dallas, Texas, the 4th richest city in America.Due to its unincorporated status (meaning that it is under basic Dallas ordinances without receiving any of the benefits of being identified with the city), the residents of this community do not have access to basic city services, including drinkable water. The nearest grocery store that offers healthy, affordable food is over 7 miles away. Most of the people living in this community are on a fixed income and lack transportation. These barriers further prohibit them from accessing affordable, healthy food options.After several attempts to bring water to the residents of Sandbranch, city politics and red tape continue to get in the way of serving the needs of the people. One might say that only money matters and the basic needs of people do not.

We will end the fundraiser on Friday. Baton Rouge and surrounding communities are experiencing historical flooding of the Amite River and connecting tributaries and bayous. This has created massive and widespread flooding in areas that have never flooded before. Many people have been evacuated by boat or helicopter leaving behind everything. UPDATE: estimated 6.9 trillion gallons of rain fell between 8/8-8/14; East Baton Rouge Parish had 19 in of rain in 15 hours; Livingston Parish had 31.39 in of rain in 24 hours; more than 20,000 people have been rescued from flood waters; 13 people have died; flooding continues to spread south to other parishes as the water drains; 22,000 people are without power; more than 40,000 homes were flooded; 30 parishes have been declared disaster areas; expected frequency of a flood of this magnitude is every 500 years.Pediatria HealthCare's Pediatric Day Health Care Center (PDHC) in Baton Rouge is serving as a medically fragile shelter for children and their families. The facility is staffed with several employees who have lost their homes and vehicles to the flood. Although they are dealing with their personal loss, these amazing employees are providing care to the most fragile pediatric population affected by this disaster. We are so thankful for these devoted employees. UPDATE: Our center is now back to regular operations but with many employees and patients unable to return at this time. Employees and families are dealing with the loss of personal irreplaceable belongings. Many homes are still inaccessible.While we have not been able to contact all employees yet due to the cellular service outage, there are 11 that have reported significant flooding inside their homes and loss of property. They have found shelter at our facility, other community shelters, or with friends and family. Everyone is safe but in need of assistance. UPDATE: We have contacted all employees and all are safe. Many have been displaced to live with relatives and friends or hotels/shelters. Among the employees that were flooded out of there homes - 3 aides, 3 drivers, 5 nurses.In response to this federal disaster, and on behalf of theemployees in our Baton Rouge PDHCwho were devastated by the recent flooding,Pediatria HealthCare is creating this GoFundMe campaign to raise money to assist with recovery.The money raised during this campaign will be divided among the employees that have lost their homes.

Thank you & God bless you! I would love to share a little bit of my story and what the 2015Dining With Grace Community Banquet is about.(Warning: This is not bad news...this is about sharing the GOOD NEWS!)My name is Grace and I am a Chef in Brooklyn, NY. I entered the culinary world after being layed off from a corporate job in 2009.  It was shortly thereafter that the vision for this Surprise Community Banquet came to life and I named my catering service Dining With Grace. I hadn't realized that I've developed a love for cooking as a child in my parent's church helping them prepare and serve dinners in our small church in Brooklyn, NY.  I remember my Dad goingdirectly to the shelters and to the homeless in the community and invited them to dine with us.  We all ate together and enjoyed great music. These people became our brothers and sisters.  I realized then, at a tender age the power of sharing food with love, especially to those who need it.Fast forward to 2015. I'm still a Chef :-) but my vision for the Community Banquethas not yet been manifested...until NOW.  I shared my vision with an amazing, young & vibrant faith community, Brooklyn Ark- and they encouraged me to make it happen.  The Vision is for an appointed time!! (Habakkuk 2:3) On Saturday, August 1st 2015 we are hosting our 1st Dining With Grace Community Banquet for 120 of our homeless neighbors from 2 local shelters in Brooklyn.  Our goal is to nourish our community differently than typical, treating the participants as highly esteemed guests attending a banquet.  This event is a surprise for them and we are so excited shower them with love.  (These residences have been supported by a wonderful organization called Keys to Abundant Life, where I am a Nutritional Culinary Arts Instructor for many of the community's children in the facilities after-school program)The event includes:-A lovingly prepared Chef-created meal by myself and Celebrity Chef Pedro Rodriguez-Live, Uplifting entertainment and music-Toiletries and School Supplies drive -Hospitality & prayer team to connect with guestsWe really need your help to bring this vision to fruition and absolutely cannot do it without you.

There are only twenty verified round barns in the State of Oregon and this is the only one in Lane County. The money will be used to put the cupola back on top, re-roof the barn, repair the wood slats under the roof, as well as re-roof and repair the attached milkhouse. The objective is to restore the exterior first and then restore the interior, returning it to as close to the original as possible. I hope to raise the funds now, so the roof can be replaced this summer, preventing any further damage to the barn.I am asking for outside financial help because the round barn is enjoyed and treasured by many. Once restored, my desire is to be able to share the barn with the community and apply to the National Historic Registry as a historical site. The round barn willbe used for agricultural purposes.Many people throughout Oregon know this barn as a landmark and have stories to go with it. The history of the round barn is...... it was built in 1949 by John Sumich to be used as a dairy barn. It is 72 feet in diameter and 250 feet in circumference. It has 36 stanchions circling a wood silo in the center and it was constructed with cement blocks. All the sand and gravel for its construction came from Lake Creek and the concrete was made in a portable mixer. John used logging cable from an old logging job site on Swamp Creek Road for rebar. The lumber for the framework came from the local Johnson Mill. Local labor was used for its construction. Inside the barn, the floors slope to the center where there is a trough, wide enough for a flat face shovel. There is a manure trolley on rails above. Once the trolley was filled with manure it was moved over to the manure pit and dumped. I sincerely hope you will help me restore this wonderful and unique old barn so its history can be preserved and continue to be shared with others. I will post pictures of the progress.  Many, many thanks.

Michael is known for taking in those in need, and always has a houseful of people that he cares for and looks after. Right now he and his wife are caring for some of their grandchildren, after Michael's son was struck and killed by a drunk driver in a car accident at the beginning of July 2016. Michael is a Believer, takes as much of his large family to church as he can, and is a cornerstone for the whole family. He regularly under-charges those that he does mechanic work for, because he knows that they can't afford much. Marty Schramm (& Family) have known Michael for 16 years, and he hand's down one of the kindest, most generous men Marty has ever met! Michael and his family's house is desperately in need of a new roof, as their's is very old, falling apart, leaking water into the house, and covered in a plastic tarp in an attempt to keep the weather out. Because of a tight income, and providing for all of family and friends in his home, the finances for a new roof are just not available for them. Our goal is to encourage and care for their family in this challenging and desperate time of need, by raising enough money for a new roof for Michael and his family, as well as have it put on, by Thanksgiving 2016! We have a crew of men who are willing to donate labor to get the roof put up, if the funds for the material are raised!

The Sunshine Club is inspired by the question  what can we do to help our local schools? The easy answer is mentoring: In my experience as a middle school & high school teacher and as a mentor for Pinellas County, I have seen firsthand the impact a mentoring program can have on a student and the positive relationships that can be built. It's about hope, stability, encouragement and frankly it's just fun for everyone involved. I want to expand this opportunity to other kids in the hopes of developing relationships, connections and fostering a positive attitude towards school.How will we do this? We're going to start small by limiting our first season to 10 students local to Campbell Park, ages 6-10. We'll start our Saturdays by talking about the week, i.e. what happened in school, and encourage them to share exciting stories. Then, we'll do a weekly craft and provide a snack (preferably healthy!) Basically, it's a dedicated time and place for these kids to congregate in a healthy, creative and positive environment.I can't do this alone it takes a tribe to care for our youth. I am looking for community partners to help initiate and grow the program. Specifically, I'm looking for donations to cover the cost of the crafts (see below for the collage of the exciting, seasonal cute projects) and food.I hope we can count you in and look forward to growing in the future! More about me: I grew up attending Pinellas County schools and went on to earn my Bachelors and Masters degrees in Education at USF. Currently, I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Curriculum and Instruction at the University of West Florida. I taught in Pinellas County Schools, including Dunedin Middle and East Lake High School, for six years and for the past two years I have been at SPC teaching math.

It is important to obtain a driver's license to be able to find work. Yet, the state Department of Licensing does not accommodate French speakers who must take the written test. It is important that the Driver's Manual be translated into French so that French speaking immigrants from all nations can successfully pass the written portion of the driver's license test, and become safe drivers in our state. All funds raised will go toward translation of this 150 page manual. Funds are needed now, as a translator is standing by, with the hope of securing all funds needed, and getting the manual translated within the next 30 days.This project came about as members of the Seattle Peace Chorus collaborated with the community of Congolese for a recent concert. We learned that passing the driver's test is the #1 concern of immigrants from that nation, as it is difficult to secure work without a license.

I'd also love to help her raise a little extra money to be able to take a brief holiday and travel to a place she and Darius always wanted to travel to together, but didn't get the opportunity to. I feel a trip like this could help her in the healing and grieving process. Also, she would be able to take the trip durring the upcoming week of Darius's 1 year death anniversarry, which I'm sure will be overwhelming difficult for her.My heart is so heavy, not just for the loss of my young cousin, but as a mother myself. I can only imagine how difficult this first death anniversary will be for my aunt.If you're able to donate it will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your generosity.A loving niece,Lissa JacksonDarius Benjamin Emery, of Boston, died Friday, October 23, 2015 at his home in Boston. He was 21.

That chance is greater than breast cancer, ovarian cancer and lung cancer combined and the 98% of the time, financial abuse is used as a weapon to perpetuate the cycle of abuse. With your help, I would like to increase Domestic Violence Awareness and more specifically, through the Allstate Foundations Purple Purse.Thisis something very personal for me as it is something that I have experienced myself and witnessed. That being so, it is my goal to be a pillar for women currently suffering from abuse and empower them with the resources and encouragement that many are unaware that they need. Reverting back to the silent weapon of financial abuse that I earlier mentioned, many people who find themselves judging those women for remaining in their detrimental situation or continuously returning to it are unfortunately oblivious of the financial abuse that occurs majority of the time. Many of the women in abusive relationships struggle to find a way out because they lack the financial means to stand on their own.I plan to work withPurple Purse in conjunction with the plethora of battered women shelters and daycares in Atlanta to provide them with a place to go, money for a fresh start and aiding in finding proper jobs so they can become self-sufficient. It is my impetus to help these women through education. Not only are many unaware of the severity of the issues of domestic violence, but we often are silent on the issue of domestic violence because its taboo and often makes people feel uncomfortable. Fear of invading someone elses privacy or concluding that a person must not want to escape is an ever-growing character flaw because of how society projects the story of abuse. I ask your help in breaking the silence of domestic violence.

Rick started this incredible organization as a way to reach out to the less fortunate by way of providing a weekly meal that many depend on. Alongside the meals come socks, toothbrushes, and other supplies that are often seen as staples by the fortunate among us, but as luxuries by some below the poverty line.Our Annual livestreamevent is a 24-hour meet-up where we play video games live on the web to raise both funds and awareness for this important cause! There are various challenges, competitions, dares, sales, and auctions all along the way. RGS members who cant make it to the event can tune in via the web, as well as help raise money in the month prior to the game-a-thon.We will begin taking donations September 20th. This years stream goes live Friday, October28th. Last year we raised over $6,500!All of the proceeds from our game-a-thon will be donated directly to assist Hotdogs for the Homeless operations. There are many reasons people fall below the poverty line and into homelessness, ranging from mental disability to PTSD to simply falling on hard times. HftH is a fantastic way to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate in a tangible, life impacting way. Unlike passing cash to a panhandler, you know where your donation goes and how it is spent. Whether they be unwed mothers, impoverished children, or the homeless: those who show up to benefit from Rick Swydens organizations generosity feel the difference your financial assistance makes.

We didnt like that answer, so I aimed for a star and reached out to the family that originally donated the land, the Powells, and one the decendents the park is named for called me back! Brook Powell had already heard the news and expressed condolences at the loss of the play area for the community and they want to help! Powell Homes donated to the city the money for the structure that was just removed actually. So it shows that they have contributed greatly over the years and really feel for our situation.  OUR PART: We are asked to help ourselves, to as families that live and play here show some support, and desire for a replacement structure...by pulling together some funds, that will be matched, and get this going!

We had such a great time with the 3 of them at the park we exchanged numbers and kept in touch over the last several months.Sammie is a former Flight Attendant who is no longer able to work and is on disability. He's an older gentleman with a heart of gold who has seen and experienced so many things in his life.Jonathan is a bit younger, but is also unable to work and on disability. He's a truly amazing man who loves with all his heart and cares so deeply for Sammie and all their friends and loved ones.During their neighbors' challenging time these two went above and beyond to do EVERYTHING they could to help them... transportation, money, babysitting, emotional support, you name it!We spent a lot of time texting back and forth, and they invited my son and I to come down and visit them and return to the park so we did! These two haven't got much... but I can tell you they're two of the most generous and giving people I've ever known... and so POSITIVE to people who are kind and willing to accept it from them!They gave us a place to stay, fed us, and made us feel at home... but most of all, let us get to know them a lot better... it did not take us long to realize how very special they are.During our time visiting neighbors and friends would come by and ask for their help and NEVER ONCE did they hesitate to give these people anything and everything they asked for - no matter how much it cost or may have inconvenience them. Sometimes I personally felt they were being taken advantage of because of their generosity, and it made me feel very sad for them... but they don't see it that way... they LOVE helping others - no matter what!I learned a lot about their disabilities, challenges, and the things they've overcome in their individual lives and as a couple... and they've inspired me to be a better person and treat people as well as they do.Unfortunately, a little over a week ago... the two drove down to a family member's wedding in Tennessee and during their trip - their truck broke down. A few friends rallied to help them out, and they're both very grateful for that... but unfortunately, those willing to help them back can only do so much. They were able to rent a car to come home... and had to leave their truck behind with no idea what to expect as far as required repairs or what it would cost to get it running again... and no idea how to get back down to pick it up! And now... they've been dealt an unfortunate blow. Money's more than tight - as they're on a fixed income and barely have enough to survive and have already had more expences than they can handle - and now they need to replace the engine on their truck.For some of us living without a vehicle and relying on public transportation isn't a problem... but for Sammie and Jonathan it is. You see... Sammie has bad seizures and anxiety issues and panic attacks in difficult situations - waiting for a bus and riding a bus isn't a problem... but walking a few miles to the bus stop, dealing with big crowds of people, and other sorts of situations are really difficult - and pretty dangerous for him.Sammie and Jonathan are both disabled, with mental, physical, and medical conditions that they both do very well of taking care of together... but cannot do so without a dependable vehicle to drive.They both have medical conditions which REQUIRE them to get shots and treatments on a weekly basis. Just yesterday when they went to get Jonathan's shots it took them 6 hours to do what would have taken them 30 minutes if they had a vehicle. This is something that these two cannot do for much longer. If we don't figure out how to get their vehicle back, they're not going to be able to get the care and treatment that they need for themselves or their service animal.Right now we need to find a way to replace the engine. A new engine is over $1000 JUST for the engine.We have people in three states (including myself) trying to find a used engine to fit their truck if we can help save them money... but then we need to get it to the garage where the truck can be repaired... either way... NONE OF US can help as much as we'd like to.We need to come up with atleast $2000 to repair the truck, cover transportation to retrieve it, and to get them back home! The mechanic suggested a gofundme campaign for them... so I offered to help!I want to get them back to where they need to be as soon as possible. I don't think they can handle the situation that they're in for much more than another week or two. I spoke to them both today for a very long time and I don't think I've ever heard someone so broken down and torn as Sammie is at this moment. He's so concerned for himself, Jonathan, their pets, and their inability to help themselves - or others at the moment it absolutely breaks my heart.I adore these two and how good they are as people, to eachother, and to others... they've been so amazing to everyone they know I would be forever grateful for people to pull together and show them that their efforts to do good to and for others is not in vain.I know there are people who need more, and people in much worse situations... but I truly believe these two are well deserving of someone to help THEM out in their time of need.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Back-2-School Backpack Challenge,$34,"$1,500",Community," July 6, 2016",1,2,CHAMPLIN,MN,5000,,,"                            Connie Miskowic Sundquist                                                                                                                   CHAMPLIN, MN                                                                                Every year in every community there are students without the necessities, they need for the upcoming school year and it breaks my heart.

Recently due to some unforeseen circumstances we have lost our building, and we need urgent help. Our kids don't have a place to learn and our community haven't got 'get together spot'.We are getting bigger and bigger hence why our school require more help. We would like to raise some money to fund learning materials, new classroom and many other necessities to be able to teach Polish children their native language. Also to get parents together, socialise and grow community spirit amongst us. In the future, we would like to plan trips to Theatre and Opera. As well as Family Picnic days.Latest sad events have shown that our community is motivated, reliable and capable of sacrificing.We all would be very thankful from the bottom of our hearts if you could spare few pennies and help especially our children. They are our future and faith. Children are our investment for the better Tomorrow.Please Visit: http://nauczaniejezykapolskiego.co.uk/Polish Language in Thetford is a native language lesson, its traditions, literature and history. Learning is carried out on eight levels between the ages of 3 to 15 years. Classes last two hours and are conducted by well-trained teaching staff. We also have Sundays meetings preparing for GCSEs with the Polish language. We also invite children and adults of other nationalities to join Polish language courses. There is also the possibility of an individual course of learning. Our school emphasises on multilingualism, which has an enormous impact on the positive development of intellectual and academic achievement. We have to remember that bilingual children are more tolerant, open and more flexible. They quickly adapt to new situations comparing to monolingual children. The image of the world is richer seen by the bilingual child. To achieve these benefits is needed, however, in consequence of the development of both languages, a positive attitude to bilingualism and emotional support - particularly from parents and teachers.Witam Pastwa, jako przewodniczca samorzdu Nauczania Jzyka Polskiego w Thetford postanowiam zawalczy o nasze dzieci i odciy kadr zarzdzajc, ktrzy s ju na skraju wyczerpania.

What we didnt expect was the effect on the soldiers. Coffee has an impact well beyond its price point. It is a way of telling a soldier viscerally that they are important and that youre thinking about him or her. The expressions of thank we have gotten have been humbling but I will tell you what I tell them we did nothing except open up a conduit for people to give and people want to give to the men & women that protect us, so the true thanks belong to the people like you who donate coffee and money thus allow us to send this boon to those that are so deserving.(A benficiary of this campaign is Operation Fetch, an organization that spreads awareness about service dogs for those suffering with PTSD as depicted in this video.)Last year we had private labeled coffee for Operation Fetch and LZ Grace Warriors Retreat but selling coffee as part of your fund raising on the internet is a daunting task even when your motivated and good at it. Our solution for them was to run a local campaign asking our friends and customers to donate coffee using Ganders Choice & Cup of Grace exclusively so a third of the purchase price would go to these two organizations that do such great work. We donated 575.In order reach our goal and beyond we realized that we needed to open this up to a wider audience thusan enhanced presence on our website and this Go Fund Me page with a goal of $80,000 that would allow us to send5000lbs of coffee overseas. $16 will send 1lb of coffee to a soldier.

Built to resemble Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, the design is called programmatic architecture, popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Programmatic (also known as mimetic or novelty) architecture is characterized by construction in the forms of objects not normally associated with buildings. This type of architecture was used as one way of attracting motorists to a diner, coffee shop, or roadside attraction, such as a gasoline filling station in the shape of an airplane.OurAirplaneis one of the few examples of this type of novelty architecture that still survives in the State of Tennessee today. It is recognized nationally and internationally by inclusion in numerous books and magazines featuring roadside attractions. The Airplane Filling Station is designated as a historic site and is on the National Register of Historic Places.The Airplane sat empty and neglected for many years and was almost completely hidden by kudzu and weeds. Much of the wooden interior and framing was rotted, the roof leaked, there were no restroom facilities, and the cladding was rusting, missing, or damaged. Vandals, nature, and neglect had taken their toll until a local resident recognized the historical, architectural, and cultural value of this landmark.In 2003, a small group of individuals, who recognized the significance of this unique structure, formed the Airplane Filling Station Preservation Association, Inc. (AFSPA), a 501c (3) nonprofit organization. The membership is composed of volunteers with a formal Board of Directors and elected officers. AFSPA was formed to raise funds to prevent demolition of the structure and to restore and preserve it with the hope that it could again become a functioning building. From the outset, the goal of AFSPA has been to make the structure a self-sustaining historic site.Here is the Airplane today. We've come a long way since we began our efforts 12 years ago. Our current focus is securing two replicas of the 1930's gas pumps and installing a safety fence at the back of the property. We hope to raise at least $10,000 toward this effort.The Airplane is currently for lease or sale. If you are interested in renting or purchasing the iconic Airplane Filling Station, please leave a commenton our FB page or message Carol Johnson.Note that because of its historic designation, the Airplane mustbe open to the public 12 days per year.To learn about our organization, our work, and our fund-raising activities, visit our Facebook pages at Airplane Filling Station Preservation Association or Airplane Filling Station.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"LAKOTA TINY HOUSE NATION ,"$13,035","$25,000",Community," March 21, 2015",168,18,MANDERSON,SD,7000,8,30,"                            Mary L Collins                                                                                                                   MANDERSON, SD                                ""Grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure.

Having developed deep and meaningful relationships with the Lakota Nation over the last 10 years, I was deeply saddened and then angry about this terrible,irrevocable loss of young lives, their promise and potential. Sending my sympathy is not enough. Being in ACTION about these deaths is what everyone connected to this projectfeels must happen. In conversation withour LTHN project partners, what became most clearabout the young people of Pine Ridge is their desire and willingness to be part of something meaningful and true to the culture. These children and teens have the heart, the intellect, and the desire to do good things, to realize all their potential as Lakota and as young adults. and to be able to navigate this very chaotic and confusing world.Whilemost relativesand friendsprovide thespiritual and cultural resources needed to make their children's and grandchildren's lives happy and healthy,many of these samefamiliesdon't alwayshave the financialresources that are also necessary to support their health and wellbeing. Youth sometimes feel a hopelessness that becomes overwhelming. For those of us who do have the financial resources, and, who can make a donationwill help us to build not only Tiny Houses but will add pride, self-esteem and a measure ofsafety that comes from being part of something positive and worthwhile while not feeling isolated or alone. Your donation combined withthe sweatequity and building supplies that are waiting to be put to use at our staging area in Manderson, SD this summer (just a few miles from Wounded Knee),will help us launch this important project at a time when it willhave the greatest impact for these children and families. The Lakota Tiny House Nation team isasking you to supportour LTHN fund to ensure that we have the financial resource in place so that our team can begin accepting applications and prepare to build our first six Tiny Houses in the summer of 2015.These houses will be built by a dedicated group of mentor/carpenters, electricians and plumbers - from both on and off the Reservation, with a youth-driven team of builders. The youth will also make the decisions about who will receive the finished houses and how they will be used to better the lives of their friends, families and community. Being empowered to make decisions that impact their lives and communities in positive waysis what this is all about.  Your financial help will enable us to launch this project with the capital necessary to build the first six sound, liveable Tiny Homes that can serve as not only homes, but classrooms, food distribution centers, clinics, animal shelters, craft huts, retail stores, welcome centers, safe houses, and much more. Youth empowered. Youth managed. Youth sustained. This effort isdesignedto provide valuable training, job skills, living skills, community-building skills among peers, ownership and equity, and pride in agroup of youth that areeager to begin the project. Our further goal is to create a sustainable business andgrow it to meet other home and shelter needs while empowering a youth-driven business on the Reservation - a place where jobs are scarce. Most importantly, this is a Lakota-driven initiative with the support of allies from around the country. It is not outsiders ""fixing an Indian problem"". It isa thoughtfully considered cooperativeaction designed to provide a positive solution to a devasting tragedy. We wish to build community and cultural understanding while protecting our most valuable resource...our children. Any amount you can give will help us purchase materials for the build which will occur over a two week period in July. We anticipate the cost of each house to be between $6000 - $9,000, with some of the materials provided by the recipients themselves and some donated. We are accepting recyleable building materials as well. Your kindness, generosity and sharing of this campaign is gratefully and deeply appreciated. Many thanks and welcome tothe LakotaTiny House Nation.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"UnShame,"$2,291","$21,000",Community," January 13, 2015",33,20,GAINESVILLE,FL,2800,3,16,"                            Gretchen Casey                                                                                                                   GAINESVILLE, FL                                Gretchens StoryI was in my early twenties. I was student at UF. I was asleep in my apartment. A man broke in. Armed with a knife, he blind folded, gagged me, and tied me up, and raped me.Although an event from over 30 years ago, the memory is strong for Gainesville resident Gretchen Casey. The incident plays a role in the inspiration behind the UnShame campaign that addresses the injustice in shaming survivors and victims of sexual assault. We are raisingmoneyto pay for the launch of an online platformforrapevictimsworld wide to have accesss to resources, encouragement and support. Gretchen believes a major reason people do not seek help is because they are experiencing shame. If the first person you disclose to is a friend or family member and they respond in a way that inflicts shame or implies even the slightest amount of blame, then why would you expect or trust a stranger or organization to treat you any differently? Gretchen says its not always what youre saying, but the tone and timing of how a person asks a question or responds. This can be applied to questions like, Did you report it? Did you get a rape exam? How much did you have to drink? Why did you go there in the first place? Gretchen says its the right of every victim to feel whatever he or she feels. Certain feelings are natural and cant be immediately undone. Numbness, shock, disbelief, confusion, fear, sadness, lack of control, anxiety and betrayal are all natural emotions. But shame is the one emotion that we can really do something about. Its a feeling that can sometimes be stopped before it even begins.Did you lock your door? What were you wearing? Had you had anything to drink that night? Although no one ever asked these questions of Gretchen, shes considers herself lucky. These types of questions are common and often said without a second thought because as humans we try to make sense of why bad things happen. She said the meaning we attach to events in many ways characterizes how we think about them. When we hear about violent crime, we want to feel as if we can prevent or control that from happening to us. But when a victim starts to wonder if they could have prevented an attack, they begin to hold themselves responsible - at some level.Karma: Good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering. Looking back, Gretchen wanted to know why she was targeted, why this had happened. She dwelled on karma, questioning what she could have done to bring this upon herself. After an arrest was made it was revealed that her attacker had a history of sexual offenses and that he was indiscriminant in selecting his victims. It was the counseling she received from a Rape Crisis Center that ultimately helped her accept that no one was responsible for this mans actions other than himself. Being able to reframe what happened, re-establishing control in her life, and accepting the range and intensity of her emotions, is what ultimately helped her recover.If I had not gotten help it could have been easy for me to believe that because this vile, brutal, humiliating happened to me, now I am vile and disgusting. Somehow, what he did to me made me like him: broken. The Unshame website will address shame by teaching victim/survivors to neither over nor under- react to the feelings they experience.The UnShame StoryAlthough estimates vary, reports suggest that only 25 percent of people who report sexual assault seek counseling after the event. In addition, research on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) has linked multiple health outcomes back to untreated traumatic experiences. Long-term untreated trauma and related anxiety cause disruption in not only brain development, but daily cycles of waking, resting, sleeping, eating socializing, exercising, playing and working. Common increased risks among persons with high ACE scores were alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, suicide attempts, smoking, poor self-rated health, high numbers of sexual intercourse partners, increased sexually transmitted diseases, and increase in physical inactivity and severe obesity. In the past few years, Gretchen has felt the need to answer the question, how do we change that?Erase The Shame The main message of UnShame is that there is nothing shameful in being a victim of sexual assault. No one is responsible for an attack other than the attacker. UnShame can teach people to live beyond a perpetrators actions. The UnShame application will serve several purposes. Some people get temporarily stuck. They limit how they see themselves, or how they believe others see them, as someone who didnt prevent the assault. UnShame.org will feed empowering messages to help victims see themselves from a different perspective. Friends, family and other visitors to the site will be able to submit messages of inspiration, comfort and encouragement to feature in this feed. Also artists and other inspired viewers will be able to share work inspired by the UnShame message. But in order for words to have meaning and merit they have to be tied to an experience. Victims and survivors who have worked through their shame will be able to submit their testimony to support, inspire and empower others who may be working through a similar situation. The testimonies combined with supporters encouragement are what will make UnShames message resonate with its followers. UnShame will also allow people to submit questions about how to cope with different types and stages of shame. Gretchen will answer inquiries in the feed to help anyone who may also be struggling. Normally, I would tell anyone experiencing shame to call me, said Gretchen, but what if I could answer one, and help hundreds who are struggling with the same concern? That is the beauty of an online platform. Gretchen said she is not trying to replace crisis centers and victim services. Rather she is trying to reach the ones who have never called a rape crisis hotline. She is trying to catch the attention of someone who may otherwise never set foot in a counseling office. She wants to give victim survivors-in-hiding the opportunity to acknowledge what happened to them and realize that life continues. In addition, she hopes it encourages friends and family members of survivors to express themselves. What if after a victim shared on Unshame, a friend commented and said, I never knew. I think youre courageous. I think youre amazing. I think that takes a lot of guts to say. Im sorry that I wasnt there to support to you when this first happened. Do you know what that could do for people? Gretchen said,It brings people to their knees to know that the world is filled with good people and not just people that will take advantage of you. She also hopes that UnShame will provide the opportunity for retribution for friends and family members who may regret their initial response or reaction toward a victim.There is power in the words This is what I wish I had said, this is how I wish I had handled it,she said. But Gretchens dreams for UnShame do not end there. She thinks about other countries and other cultures where victim shaming is much more prominent. She thinks about countries were rape is a common practice and not viewed as a crime. She thinks about societies that use rape as a weapon or method of torture. Her hopes are that UnShame will provide something that would otherwise not be available to people in those areas. Gretchen said that for those who want to come out, UnShame is a channel of expression. And for those who are not ready it could be the door to freedom. Ultimately what we want to do is teach people not to depend on justice to facilitate their recovery. The accountability and reparation by an offender doesnt happen for everybody. Instead, we want to help people begin to look at where they do have control, which is what they are doing now, in this day, in this moment. The merciful thing about life is that it keeps giving you second chances, she said. Tomorrow is a new day. What can I do well today that isNOTdecided by what happened to me in the past? We want people toaddressit andmove beyondit.Livebeyond it.Live wellbeyond it. ____________________________________________________________""Out of the huts of history's shame,I rise; Up from a past that's rooted in pain,I rise .""  - Maya Angelou ------------------------------------------------------------------- QUICK SUMMARY            UNSHAMEis an ongoing message movement which providesa platform or opportunity for inspired and sensitive people to post messages thaterasethe shamethat often occurs after sexual violence. UNSHAMEis dedicated to the belief that there is no disgrace in being a survivor of sexual violence. We want people around the world to recognize the damage shame does to women, men, and children who have experienced sexual victimization. We want all humans to understand the scale of this problem and the harsh realities of sexual violence and the devastation that follows as a victim is continually degraded by shaming words and behavior.UNSHAMEwill also connect people with resources, services and blogs to help victims and survivors. Our objective atUNSHAMEis to shift the shame that victims encounter toempathy,resilience, andrecovery. You can help eliminate the unjust stigma of shame by first. 1. Donating to our web application fund 2. Sharing our message on Facebook andTwitter 3. Submitting a testimonial or letter of support for the participators of our future site Shame that is connected to rape victims gets its power from unjustly placing responsibility for an entire event or course of action on the victim.

It's our most important social institution to bring men and women together and provide the best environment for children to experience the love of a mother and father. Yet marriage is under challenge in the US Supreme Court, and their ruling could change the legal understanding of marriage for years to come. We have one remaining opportunity at the March for Marriage in Washington DC on April 25th to show the justices of the court that we want them to respect our votes and our values and uphold the right of states to preserve true marriage. Thousands of people are planning on coming to Washington to stand up for the truth of marriage, but there are thousands more who wish to come, but lack resources for transportation. This GoFundMe campaign will raise money to subsidize buses from throughout the country, many of which will originate in urban communities. Nobody should be denied the opportunity to march for marriage due to finances. The campaign will subsidize at least twenty buses. Additional funds raised beyond our goal will be used to support more buses of marriage supporters.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Save the Red Key Tavern's Neon Sign,"$9,723","$14,000",Community," October 9, 2015",224,11,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,2500,3,13,"                            Jim Settle                                                                                                                   INDIANAPOLIS, IN                                                        The Red Key Tavern ...it's legendary!

Not to mention that the Red Key is one of the most famous and loved taverns in the country.( http://www.redkeytavern.com/#!press-and-media/co40) This classic sign is more than 63 years years old and is now in need of major repair. Mickey, the neon repair specialist says, ""It's so old I don't think it's fixable back to it's iconic state. And even if I could fix part of it, there is no way to guarantee it will last for any length of time."" So there are two options and they both cost about the same...try to completely redo the original (complete makeover of everything) or construct a new sign that is absolutely identical to the original that will last for future generations to enjoy for the next 60+years. So here is your chance to contribute to one of the 150 best bars in the country for 2015 (the only bar in Indiana) at #106 on the list (  http://www.thedailymeal.com/drink/150-best-bars-america-2015-slideshow-0#45 )...and by the way, Cheers Bar in Boston is #146...take that Sam Malone! Larry, a long time patron of the Key, said we would be remiss if we didn't mention that through the years, with all the bills (money) collected on the ceiling of the Red Key Tavern by thoughtful and interesting patrons, Russ was able to donate over $250,000 to childrens charities in this city. And the tradition of bill tossing continues to this day! So let's collectively take this classic neon back to it's original state. Give what you can. It all makes a difference.

My name is Jonathan Carr, the founder of Weather NJ, formerly Severe NJ Weather. Because of my passion for meteorology, I began a Facebook page to bring public safety awareness regarding weather events to my community. For almost 6 years now, I have built a Facebook following of 204 thousand individuals. Even as professional opportunities have come my way, I have always described myself as a civilian weather enthusiast and amateur forecaster. My community knows me as JC.My Facebook page has been used as a platform for public safety and a fun place to talk about weather as well as bettering my community through charitable causes. So I want to apologize for bringing this matter to you. However, I was recently served with a civil lawsuit by Weatherboy Weather. Under the Federal District Court of New Jersey, Weatherboy Weather is seeking damages in excess of $150,000 for defamation.As my attempts to resolve this matter privately were unsuccessful, it looks as though I will have to defend myself in court. I'd like to be able to say that I can afford this on my own. After financial hardships resulting from a major relocation and my wife being sick, I simply cannot.The greatest thing about everything I've worked so hard to create and achieve is you, the followers, and thats why I am reaching out. If each of my followers contributed even a small amount, I would have enough to fund at least a retainer. These kind of defenses can end up costing over $50,000. A donation to this campaign and a share on social media will help protect me and my family as well as the Weather NJ organization.All funds collected will go towards this lawsuit. Any remaining money will be donated to a charity chosen by you.I appreciate any donations that can help keep Weather NJ alive.

We will share the final version as soon asit is closer to completion.)It's an old story: the media keeps stories about Israel in the background until Israel strikes back, and then it's front page news. We feel weak, sometimes helpless, in the face of such powerful voices overwhelming our own.Enough.It is time to simply tell our story. To combine our voices and to cry out to the world in a voice of resolute strength and determination.Let'sbuy a full page ad in the New York Times, one of the most popular newspapers in America, and simply tell the stories of those we have lost and give a comprehensive list of all the attacks against the Jewish people of Israel.Let's do what the media will not do: tell the stories and facts as we know them. Prominently. Loudly. Strongly.We must equal their front page strength. And that is what this ad is about.This is time sensitive so the goal is to get this done by October 15th at the latest!To answer some questions you may have:1. How do you know this will accomplish anything? Will we actually change any minds?Of course, no one ad, no one event, no one article, will ever cause a transformation overnight. Thats not what this is about. Its about three things: 1. Empowering ourselves. We are giving ourselves a voice in the very place we feel voiceless. And that will reverberate beyond the pages of the New York Times. It will reverberate toother outlets (which is the real strategy here) and also through this very campaign.2. It will simply provide the facts and information that people reading these outlets are truly unaware of. How many Americans know that there may be a third intifada in progress? We will be able to educate, even if we won'tpersuade.3. There is an inherent worth in simply doing the right thing. There is something quite simply, and terribly, unjust in how the Israeli narrative is shaped throughout the world. Sometimes we have to do something just because we have to.2. What happens if you don't reach your goal?If we don't hit our goal, we will give the money to StandWithUs, who have promised to use it towards marketing the very message we are trying to send, but in other avenues.3. Is it really worth it to spend so much?The media's narrative is changing the way lawmakers approach Israel. Its changing the way voters look at us. It emboldens organizations like Hamas.The media is incredibly powerful. And we might notbe able to change it. But at least we can force our way into the conversation.4. I don't like the NYTimes. Why should I give them money?The impact outweights the cost. We will go straight to the source of the misinformation and hidden journalism. So: We can not give them money and not have a voice, or we can give and have a huge impact.5.Are you sure the New York Times would accept such an ad?I spoke directly with their ""activist"" ad representative, and she assured me that it would be. She gave me a few guidelines, none of which will affect our ad. She also promised to work with me to make sure it meets the standards required before it's posted.6.

While the north end was concrete and able to be mopped up, the staff struggled to keep water from going under the floor at the south end to no avail.Water damage to a wood skating floor is catastrophic and unfortunatelyhad a door blown open or a hole in the roof occured, apparently it would have been covered but this loss is not covered by West Bend Insurance Company. The rain blew in through the spaces aroundthe emergency doors that were installed toour Village fire codes and cannot be made to be totally waterproof. This is the first time this has happened in 25 years.For close to 45 years, this roller rink with it's amazingrotunda wood floor has delighted families, children, schools and organizations with the best in roller skating fun. We have helped numerous organizations and schools raise money and now we need your help to get the work done to preserve the floor for generations to come.We need the money quicklyto get the floor refinished before the start of the school year. The rink will have to be closed for a week to facilitate this work. The company, from Tennessee has to bring in large riding sanders to take off all the floor coating and then restripe and recoat the floor. ServPro will be running huge dehumidifiers to remove the remaining moisture out of the floor.No matter where we have traveled to people have heard about the Orbit. They've skated there, had parties there, took lessons or classes and some folks even bring their grandchildren to skate where they grew up. It would be heartbreakingto lose this iconic facility that has brought smiles to so many. We do not have the money to do this work ourselves.Please choose one of our donation packages and help us keep Orbit Skate Center the wonderful, family place that it has been for so long.

And in 1952 on a large wooded parcel situated on route 302 in West...brook, Maine the building of that dream began. The rumbling of bulldozers broke the silence of the still, early morning air. Trees were felled, load after load of gravel was brought in, wires laid, sound and lighting installed, and a snack bar and projection room were built. At last in May of 1953 up sprang the silver screen tower, and the Pride's Corner Drive-In was born! The sights, smells, and sounds of this drive-in are priceless. One hears the sound of children laughing, and teens may have a date, perhaps even experience a first kiss. There's nothing more romantic than sitting under a star-lit sky with the one you love. The pungent waft of popcorn in the air mingles with the smell of pine trees. Families enjoy one another's company, as car- loads of people pick their perfect parking spot and set up ""camp"". Where else can you find good times, candy, and soda pop, with plenty of room to toss a football or Frisbee before it gets dark and the movies start (always 2 for 1). The scene evokes memories of a different era, a time when skies were a little bluer, people were a little friendlier, and families set aside time for one another. With time comes progress. And with progress comes change. Just as Television made the switch from analog to digital, so is the film industry moving to ALL digital. This means that the 35mm film that has been run at the drive in for so many years will no longer be in production. All new movies released will be available in digital format only. Pride's Corner must purchase a digital projector in order to continue this great American tradition. It's a piece of history, and a way of life representing freedom, desire, creativity, strength, love, and determination that must be preserved. Please help this great American family tradition.

Plastics are a large part of that enviro damageand in 2004 I began a journey to see what we could do that makes a difference.Plastic pollution often results from poor or nonexistent recycling options or the lack of motivation to bother trying. Mostplastics are recycled when it is profitable to do so, and the price varies with the petroleum market.We first learned about plastic to fuel conversion in 2009 and began our education process about the technology and the options available. P2F creates far greater value for recycling than the current market.We discovered that most conversion processes are similar, building sized facilities converting tons per day and that served a small market of corporate clients. We were hoping for something small enough to reach smaller communities, and soon we found it.We have set up a relationship with our local College and University to examine the fuel this process creates and wish to share this with our community and local industry in order to insure that this process is safe and clean.We would like help purchasing a small scale P2F converter to run our tests with school, community and agriculture industry to introduce a profitable recycling option that is compact enough to set up in remote or isolated areas. The profitable aspect of this technology will introduce a motivation to better manage plastic waste, in turn keeping it from our ocean environment.We could certainly use your support.

On this land we will build homes, stores, farms, schools, medical facilities, etc.Alkebulan Community is a group of black and muslim people who are simply tired of living in a society that has been built on oppressing and killing people who look like us. The community is made up of many people with different belief systems, education, and socio-economic backgrounds, that are coming together for one common goal. That goal is to start creating a independent communities so we can advance and protect ourselves and our own self-interests. We exist to undue centuries of brainwashing and the negative influence of the dominant society, and to influence our people of African descent to separate, gain economic freedom, and use our power to create revolutionary change. We also welcome people of all racial backgrounds who are tired of living in a system that was designed to put one race above the other. our mission is to live in harmony and to fight a common enem together. We will not turn away someone because of the color of their skin. If we did that we would be no better then the people and the system we want to seperate from. It dont matter what your racial background is if you feel the same way as us then you are welcome. We our a african centered community and most of our events and education will be centered on teaching and reconnecting our people who have lost their identy due to centuries of slavery and oppression in this country.We now have to ask ourselves, ""How do we change the equation?"" We have to be the leaders that are needed. We have to step up and force change. No one is going to come and save us. We have to save ourselves. Now we are taking steps to do just that, because we have to unite in order to survive. Our people have been beaten down and destroyed and it is up to us to present a different option. We are building the promise land and paving the way for others to follow our lead. When we have been successful, when Alkebulan has risen from the ashes and its light is shining in all the darkest places that our people dwell, you will see something in our peoples eyes.Something that is beyond dangerous to our oppressors. Something that cannot be beaten out of us as long as we stand strong, and something that will change the hearts and minds of our people. That is hope at the end of a very long and dark tunnel. Hope that stirs the soul and awakens those that have long been asleep. Every morning I wake up and I see something on the horizon. I see past the bloody battlefield. The strewn and mutilated bodies of those who have fallen. Our people who are victims of so many evils that have befallen our people.

As the captain and quarterback of the Panthers, National Preps football team, Zoruan was that great kid who everyone looked up to as an example of a positive role model. He was involved with Steve Harveys Foundation and attended his Mentoring Camp for Young Men. Because of his leadership, he was selected to give the class gift to the commencement speaker, David Johns, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, this past June. Zoruan was a college freshman this year, attending the University of the District of Columbia. He had goals for completing his bachelors degree to ensure a stable future for his son. At just eighteen years of age, Zoruan was a responsible father, and held down two jobs, one of which was cleaning National Prep in the evenings as an employee of the PMM Facilities Management, LLC. National Prep is completely devastated over the loss of one of our most esteemed leaders who did everything right and was in the right place (a positive community event) at the wrong time, stated Jennifer Ross, Executive Director and Founder. At this time the school is asking for privacy and the opportunity to process what has happened before beginning the healing process for their children. Grief counseling services are being provided to assist students. What is most important to the school right now, is to surround Zoruans family by establishing this Go Fund Me page for his son. The school wants to ensure that Zoruan'schild has everything in his life, that his father intended to provide for him through his hard work and dedication in his short young life of just eighteen years.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Burnside Skatepark,"$33,429","$40,000",Community," October 26, 2014",384,23,PORTLAND,OR,2200,5,6,"                            Toni Darnall-Shackleton                                                                                                                   PORTLAND, OR                                                                                Built nearly a quarter century ago by a dedicated group of renegade skateboarders Burnside Skatepark is the preeminent DIY skatepark in the world.

Many folks may not know that every merchant provides their own structure at our event, and they are responsible for maintaining it. Many of them are small businesses that dont have lots of resources available for repairs. I want to shift our focus to our amazing merchants that join us to put on such a fantastic show. The majority of money already raised as well as any money raised from this point on will go directly to a Merchant Relief Fund to help them with supplies and paint to make sure everything is as pretty and complete as possible when we open. Please share this with small business owners as well as RenFest merchants who would like to help their own!In recent months, the Louisiana Renaissance Festival has endured not one, but two devastating floods. The first, occurring on March 16th, was the highest flood ever recorded in the area, and considered a 100 Year Flood. The second, only five months later, replaced Marchs record rising to a staggering 27.33 feet. At its worst, RenFest grounds were submerged under more than 10 feet of water. In both instances our site (and our people) were impacted beyond measure.Following the first flood, we opted to seek volunteers rather than donations. As usual, our people pulled through, selflessly donating their time to help a community in need. Unfortunately, the second flood has pushed us well beyond the limit of what were able to endure alone financially. Were humbled to ask for your help today.Both floods have cost our faire thousands of dollars worth of damage. Your donation will help fund our recovery efforts to ensure this years RenFest is better than ever.Weve never been more proud to be part of such an unbelievably resilient community. With your help, well pull through this and show the world exactly what we're made of. We truly appreciate your love and support.The following information was requested by GoFundMe due to the increasing number of flood recovery pages being created, and GoFundMe's sincere desire to ensure only legitimate entities can raise money for the disaster.I am Richard Hight, one of the owners of the Louisiana Renaissance Festival. I live in Loranger, LA, about 10 minutes from the Renaissance Festival site. Funds raised by this page will be dispursed to me, and I will use 100% of the funds to pay for equipment and supplies needed to recover from the flood. This will include equipment such as multiple pressure washers (approx $1400), mold control chemicals ($35/bottle with an average of 3 bottles per building for about 100 building, $3,500), general cleaning supplies (chemicals, brushes, buckets, etc. for all buildings), feeding volunteers (for the last flood we had 350 people help at about $4/person). It will also be used to repair damaged buildings (including merchant owned buildings) as well as fence and facade. We will also use a portion of these funds to help our cast and workers who have received major damage to their homes, with several of them no longer having homes to stay in. I currently have three of our workers that are living at my home (at my expense) while they try to determine what they are going to do, and have spent several hundred dollars helping others make their homes livable.Once again, thank you for donating, enabling us to be as ready as possible when open this year and once again put on a first rate event this November!Richard HightOwner/General ManagerLouisiana Renaisance Festival+ Read MoreRead Latest Update""Our Glass House, Cincinnati, Ohio","$67,855","$5,000",Community," June 4, 2015","3,098",15,CINCINNATI,OH,2200,152,,"                            Ronald Moon                                                                                                                   CINCINNATI, OH                                                        The outpouring of donations, no-cost professional services and community support has gone above and beyond anything I could've imagined.When I posted my YouTube video on June 3, 2015 ( https://youtu.be/NbbFiTMn_ok)roughly 30 minutes after I was attacked by the three young men and two young women who were attempting to break into the family home I had been renovating into what is now Our Glass House, I had no idea their actions would serve as the catalyst for a great opportunity for change in the Evanston community.As we move forward, Our Glass House will be relying on your continued financial and community support.

Since 1986 Ive been making satirical guerrilla street posters of politicians who, by my reckoning, have too much power over us and have been abusing it in the name of representative democracy. Over the years Ive developed an irregular street army of wonderful volunteers, around the U.S. When I can, I travel with my posters, and with help from local activists, put them up on the streets. Its my way of hopefully tickling people into thinking along with us about the state of our democracy.My new poster campaign, BULLY CULPRIT/CAN'T EVEN, is about Donald J. Trump, whom I consider to be a major threat to our countrys social and political values. I feel so strongly about Trumps demagogueryespecially his appeals to hate, fear and prejudicethat Ive made a double-sided street poster about him! With your help Im hoping to get 1000s of them printed, shipped, and pasted up on the streets of America before the November election.Printing, shipping, supplies, and travel are costly. But with your help I promise well be out there practically every night, spattering ourselves with glue and doing our best to deliver the message. Additionally, since I cant get toeverycity Id like to cover, Imoffering to send posters anywhere in the U.S.,to those volunteers who are truly committed to getting them up in their area. From the East Coast to the West Coast, to the prairies, to Hawaii and Alaskayes,evenAlaska! Please sign up for email updates at my website's Home Page. If you're serious about putting together a volunteer crew in your own city or town, please email me with your details and I'll be in touch ASAP! Well update everyone with images of posterings from places weve visited, as well as photos we've received from volunteers whove distributed them in their towns.Perks: For anyone who donates $40 or more, and wants one for him/herself, I'll send you a personally signed and dated, individual copy of the double-sided TRUMP poster! Please send me an email with your mailing address. (More signed posters from 30 years of past poster campaigns are also be available through my webstore , starting at @$25 + S&H). Every penny helps toward meeting our goals.We cant let Trump happen here! And with your help, we wont.

Who hasn't heard about the protest throughout Oregon for Human Rights and Dignity with the chanting sounds and cries of #BlackLivesMatter? Who hasn't witnessed the powerful and articulate testimony over 5 years in senate judiciary hearings, at the human rights commission, school board meetings and even a trip to meet with Michelle Obama in 2013 to represent victims of gun violence . Who hasn't seen the national reporting of her activism including political candidacy in support of and with our voiceless communities of color here in Portland and througout Oregon whenever called upon?In over 5 years this woman has helped to inspire, educate and organize Oregonians who have been left our of the role of community member. She has leveraged the voices of community members who are the most oppressed and unseen in society #TheThrowaways The ones who have appointed representation, with no voice of their own....Who knew that Teressa Raiford, has been able to accomplish so much service without a home, sponsor organization, or financial support? How are we going to continue to say #BlackLivesMatter when we are not even aware that the #BlackVoices of Activist Matter TOO! Allieship should be more than a trip to the march wearing a t-shirt or buying a button. Being in Support of #BlackLives should be done in a conscious effort to support those who are fighting on the front lines. being a sovereign organization is a condition of the poverty Teressa is fighting against.  Support her Today by making a contribution to this fund and then share it and request that people make a matching contribution. Friends of #DontShootPDX have gotten together and found a place for her to move in and we want to cover the initial expenses so that this can become a long term home. Teressa needs rest and medical attention... she also needs to be able to focus on the educational assets that have developed through her unique and impressive leadership.

Living conditions are harsh, yet many tribal members continue to try to better their lives and the lives of others. Pine Ridge is an extreme food desert, meaning that healthy food, or even any food, is not available within walking or public transport distance for most people. The closest organic produce is found 100 miles away for many tribe members. Grocery stores on the reservation are full of processed white flour based food. Diet related heart disease and adult and juvenile diabetes are at epidemic rates (60% diabetes for adults), and average age of death for a male Lakota is age 48, for women, 52. Some try to grow their own vegetables and fruits, but weather is extreme, with hail the size of golf balls in July, freezes or snow occasionally reported in June or August, powerful, hot, drying winds, and temperature extremes from 115 F in summer to as low as -50 F wind chill in winter. Pests such as grasshoppers invade en masse on a regular basis. It can be very challenging to grow food on the reservation. The area is called the Badlands for a reason. Housing is also a huge problem, with sometimes 20 people living in one household. Some families live in RVs with holes in them, and there has been black mold discovered in the walls of federally provided housing which makes people sick. Every year, people freeze to death in their own home because of lack of insulation, and inadequate heating. The hand that has been delivered to the Lakota has not been a fair one, and we want to help remedy that.(Many thanks to the organization Lakota Children for permission to use their photo - lakotachildren.org)Oglala Lakota Cultural and Economic Revitilization Initiative (OLCERI) is a Lakota-run organization dedicated to demonstrating resilient solutions for living and surviving on Pine Ridge reservation. Grow Permaculture is a partner organization, collaborating to create resources to address the most severe situations on the reservation - the essentials of life: food, water, shelter, and energy. We are asking your help with a project that can make a difference for a lot of people. If everyone on the list gave $10, we would reach our target, so please don't think that any amount is too small - it will make a huge difference because we will use it well and wisely!Walipini GreenhouseThe right type of greenhouse is a very good solution to all of the above situations since the growing season is extended, plants are protected from the weather, people can have greens all year around, and it can even provide healthy protein in the form of fish in tanks. A similar model can be attached to a home, providing passive solar heating in the winter. The design could be modified into housing that will use much less energy and offer more protection from the weather, is affordable, and much healthier than many of the current options for people at Pine Ridge. Greenhouses have been built and damaged by severe weather on the reservation, so we have put some thought into how to create one that will last, and work well. A Walipini or pit style greenhouse is designed to create maximum retention of heat from the suns effect on the mass of the earth. If youve ever felt rocks or the ground radiating heat after the sun goes down, you will understand the effect created. Lakota tribal member Bryan Deans is head of OLCERI and the chief designer of the green house. He designed the greenhouse to be easily replicated, inexpensive, uses minimal materials, passively heated, and easy to access. He sees the need for a greenhouse design which can be broadly used and implemented on the reservation. These greenhouses could be a stable source of fresh greens and healthy protein for people who have little access to healthy food currently.As part of this design, we will experiment with outdoor aquaponics, using two very large salvaged tanks that we will dig into the earth to replicate ponds. These are deep enough to provide space for native fish to overwinter without freezing. We will continue to use this greenhouse model to try out new techniques, ever looking for ways to make it easier for Lakota to produce their own healthy food year around despite the harsh environment. The problems that must be addressed with the designAffordable - the greenhouse must be inexpensive, which means minimal materials neededEasy to build - the easier and less complicated it is, the more likely people will be to try it. It must focus on use of local materials and resources, thereby creating more independence.Passively heated - must survive on passive heat; most people wont pay to heat their greenhouse in winter - they cant afford itResilient - Must stand up to wind, hail, freezes and other rough elements. Can hold heat - Must be sufficiently insulated to retain heat overnight. This design is more than a greenhouse as it will also create a prototype for a number of techniques that can be used to create housing on the reservation. Geothermal heating and cooling, earth bermed structure, cold sinks, plant-created microclimates, and sustainably harvested timber frame are some of the aspects that could be used in sustainable, non-toxic, passively heated and cooled housing.There are many ways that we will be able to use and disseminate the knowledge gained through building these prototypes. We will share the information gained and will document through video and written word.We follow the permaculture principles ""Accept feedback and self-regulate"" so will be documenting both short and long term outcomes, and adjusting the design accordingly.Plastic cover, pipes, meters, wood (sustainably harvested), fuel, door, flooring, soil, water catchment tank, labor: $5000-7400. There are variable factors involved that can raise or lower the costs. This is a large structure and costs are very low for the size and functions it will be capable of.This is the beginning of the greenhouse on Pine Ridge reservation Natural Earth and Straw Multiuse Building:Another building on site has been started and we would like to complete it this summer/fall. This is a large building (72 X 56) which will be used to: Protect equipment from the weather so that it can be repaired in the wintertime. This equipment, such as a bobcat owned by OLCERI, is used on the ranch and to support community - to build housing, extract vehicles that slip off the road, create well pipelines and other potentially life saving action.Create a space for manufacture facility for hi efficiency heaters. These are super efficient wood burning heaters that can burn twigs and small sticks from bushes, or even straw or dried grass, and provide decent heat. Bryan has designed one that will work well in reservation housing to heat water and the home.These can be life saving and will reduce costs of buying propane or firewood. They also protect the environment by providing more efficient heat and protecting trees. Create a space for intern housing and classroom. This site will be used to educate Lakota and others on these building and other techniques for resilience. This building will have many features that will serve as examples to that can be replicated. It incorporates passive cooling and heating, natural building with locally available, sustainably harvested, inexpensive or free materials, training for Lakota in these building techniques, and community building barn raising techniques by which many Lakota can get their own healthy, safe housing built.This building will serve multiple functions by providing much needed shelter for project volunteers and interns, employment for Lakota (unemployment is 80% or more), a demonstration of inexpensive, resilient, passively heated and cooled housing, and training in techniques of resiliency to Lakota on the reservation. Most grants and foundation will not fund a natural building like this. We have the personnel to do this now, this year, and grants often usually take many months to be disbursed, so we are coming to you to crowd fund this project.Shot of frame and footingsTin roof, wood framing, garage door, doors and windows, flooring, pipes and electrical wire, lighting, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, straw bale, cordwood, Lakota labor, etc: $34,700This is extremely inexpensive for a building this size.There are two other smaller projects we are doing that we are excited about:Little Free Library Boxes:Pine Ridge has NO public libraries! We want to remedy that, to start, by installing Little Free Libraries in every town on the reservation. Here is an example of what they look like:We plan to install several of these in each town in Pine Ridge reservation. We will start in the town of Pine Ridge itself, which is the largest town on the reservation, and closest to the OLCERI ranch.We would like to build at least 10 of these to start with. At least one of them should be larger - like the above phone booth model. We have already gotten a couple hundred books donated and several organizations and individuals have agreed to donate more. OLCERI has a storage unit to store the books until they are distributed. We expect to continue to fill these libraries and are hoping that people take the books home and re-read them or pass them to friends. We have focused on acquiring materials on homesteading, off grid living, sustainable living, healthy living and Lakota culture but we accept books on any subject. We are of course very interested in childrens books! Materials, labor and crew to install 10 boxes: $1500If you have books to donate, please send them to: OLCERIHC 66 Box 21Chadron, NE 69337-9601BEE HIVESWe want to build several bee hives for a local Lakota beekeeper. In conjunction with that, we will be planting native wildflowers along a ditch and gully area as pollinators and a potential cash crop for Lakota (some wildflowers are medicinal, for instance). Materials and wildflowers will cost $400.We have gotten the agreement of a professional builder who is willing to volunteer to get this done and will be coming this August. His name is Chuck Bell, from from Building With Heart. Another professional carpenter is arriving from the East Coast. Several other volunteers have some building experience as well.We have lined up volunteer groups to build all of these things, but we are lacking funding for materials only. We are asking for you help to accomplish these projects. We will keep you infoed with photos, stories and more, throughout the building process. We are also very interested in both your creative and practical ideas and suggestions for how we can make this the most effective project possible! And please share any questions you might have as well.Conclusion:We need approximately $40,000 total to complete the two buildings, libraries and beehives (this is very inexpensive for buildings of this size, but we are very good at getting the most for the money). All of these projects were chosen because they use local, sustainable and available resources to build economic, environmental and social opportunities. We can fund one or more of these without meeting the full target, but we would of course like to complete them all.We will start each of these projects once we have sufficient funds to finish. In the case of the large multi-use building, we will start once we have sufficient funds to build the shell and we have the needed materials on site. Our start date for this years build is August 1. We will continue to share our planning process with you here, and photos of the build happening when it starts. Help us make a difference for people who are living in very harsh conditions! We do not want to go even one more year before having these buildings in place. If we can get these done this year, we can focus on building these elsewhere on the reservation by next year and educating more people on how to do it themselves, which can save lives, and give people a break from the harsh conditions. If we beat our target, funds will go toward future buildings on the reservation.FACTS:Pine Ridge Reservation has an average family income of just   $3,700 a year. The unemployment rate is 80%, alcoholism is at a four time higher rate than the national average; it has also the highest rates of cancer and heart disease as well as diabetes, with almost half the population over the age of forty suffeing from diabetes; infant mortality rate is five time higher than the national average and the average life expectancy for males is 48 and for women 52 years, lowest in the Western Hemisphere other than Haiti.From lakotachildren.org: ""The United Nations has declared Pine Ridge one of the most historically wronged and marginalized indigenous groups in the world. A 2012 Human Rights report warned that unless the United States engages in meaningful reconciliatory action its moral credibility will be in jeopardy when it makes human rights demands of other nations. Many Americans are shocked to learn of the health disparities, educational inequalities and housing conditions on Pine Ridge and other rural reservations.""A staggering forty-nine percent of the residents live below the Federal poverty level according to US census data.  Tuberculosis rate on the Pine Ridge Reservation is approximately 800% higher than the U.S. national average Cervical cancer is 500% higher than the U.S. national average At least 60% of the homes on the Pine Ridge Reservation are infested with Black Mold Stachybotrys.The school drop-out rate is over 70% There is an estimated average of 17 people living in each family home( a home which may have two to three rooms).

(More info: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_579a7a48e4b00e7e269eebc9) We know that while that may have cancelled their idea of pride...pride is very personal and very important to our community. In 1969 members of the LGBT community had enough of being tormented and oppressed and stood up for their rights as United States citizens who wanted to love who they wanted to love and be who they wanted to be. While we have come so far in our fight...we have a long way to go. We must continue to fight to change people's hearts and minds each and every day. We must continue to stand up and be proud of who we are and who we love. We must continue to stand up to all forms on inequities and injustices and we know that when we come together we are stronger!In the last few months the LGBT community has suffered horrific acts of violence that killed 49 members of our community that were just trying to have fun at a nightclub. We have also heard political rheteroric that has demonized us and wants to set us back many years in our fight for basic civil rights.As our brothers and sisters in 1969 acted out and said NO ONE will silence us and stop us from being PROUD of who we are. We need to show that young person that is struggling with their gender or sexual orientation that they are NOT alone. That they are loved. That there are many people just like them and that the LGBT community has many allies that support them. Together we are truly stronger.This fund was started to support thebasic costs to put on a Pride March & Festival for 2016.

They have full control of all money raised. Scott@claddaghcottagepub.com or Vicki@claddaghcottagepub.comThe strip mall that theCladdagh Cottage occupies is being sold and the building will be torn down to make way for a Walgreens. We are heartbroken.The owners Scott Vocca & Vicki Gish purchased the pub from theformer owner Jimmy Mulvaney in February. It was their dream to own the pub that means so much to them, as well as each of us. Their story is below.This GoFundMe account is to help relocate the Claddagh Cottage . For those who may not know, in order to open a pub with a kitchen init, itwill be very expensive. Commercial grade kitchens are now required by code, as the current pub is grandfathered into old building codes it was not required. Scott & Vicki wish to stay in the area, maintain the look, atmosphere, love, friends, drinks, and food that we all love at the Claddagh. With your help, they can do just that.Any unused proceeds will be donated to a charity that Scott & Vicki choose.Here is Scott & Vicki's story:Scott andVicki met at the Claddagh Cottage on Halloween of 2000.Vicki was in the house band called Bualadh Bos with Colm and Philip Mullen, Mike Velasquez (Mickey Squeeze), Chris McNew and with Stacia Lewis running the sound and organizing.Vicki joined the band in 1999.They played Irish folk/rock like the Pogues and originals written by Colm. Scott came to listen to the band on that Halloween and brought his banjo.They ended up jamming with him afterwards until the wee hours. Soon he joined the band. After several months of having fun playing with Bualadh Bos, the band split apart. Scott andVicki had a keen interest in playing traditional Irish music sothey started playing tunes together. They also fell in love. In February of 2001Scott convincedVicki to go to the Claddagh and play some tunes with him, sitting at a table. Soon others joinedthem and then it became a regular every-other Tuesday event. Then one of the musicians, David Armstrong, asked ifthey could move it to Wednesday since he started taking a class on Tuesdays. Sotheir first Wednesday session was on September 12, 2001. That was a difficult day but music broughteveryone welcome relief from the grief of September 11th.As the years went on, many people came into and through the session.They have met all our good friends through the fellowship of the music and this great pub. Their session is the longest running session that has stayed in one venue in the Southeast. It has attracted many great musicians from all over, while visiting Orlando for work or vacation. We have been fortunate to play with many people who have contributed to the session over the years. They are: John and Cathy Benton, Kathleen Dugan Cavanagh, Stacia Lewis, Ralph Eyman, Valerie Kitcher, Rick Norry, David Armstrong, Patrick Looney, Marty Groody, Christian Mildh, Bob Denton, Julian Lambertson, Heather Gilmer, Justin Murphy, Will Cooper, Gillian Sharer, Matt Saunders, Becky and Dale Wood, Sharon Hartman, Cliff Cagle, Chris Johnson, Dan Bradbury, Anne Dillon, Elliott Klaber, Lamont Goff, Kevin Hing, Jill Langer and Keri Halverson, Josephine Carey, Zac Leger, John Maze, Larre Reeves, Virginia Boone, Josie Davenport, Lane Pritchard, Robbie Zukaskas, Gary White, Diane Cardarelli, Janis Deane, Stephen Payne, Don Penzien, Jason Van Steenwyck, Micheal Bolton, Bobby Brannon, and John Winston and many more we haven't mentioned.Some of the notable musicians that have graced us with their presence are: Eamonn Dillon, Skip Healy, Brendan Begley, Brian MacNamara, John Whelan, Joey Abarta, Mick OBrien, Andrew OBrien, Sean Ryan, Willie Kelly, Patrick Ourceau, Pat and Cathy Sky, Michael Cooney, Benedict and Hilari Koehler, Florence Fahy, Josh Dukes, rlaith and Brogan McAuliffe, David Power, Gerry Hanley, Michael Stribling, Dan Lowery, Alan Murray, Alastair White, Anna Colliton, Kevin Buckley, Colin Farrel, Shane Farrel, Damien McCarthy, Mike Walsh, and Arthur Stones.We were also blessed with the presence of a true gentleman, Irishman, historian, shanachie and singer, Sean Kelly. If you came to the session from around 2011 to 2014, you might have caught him singing, sometimes in Irish. When he sang, the whole pub would get quiet to listen to him. He was always full of compliments and kind words. He passed away in November of 2014. He is missed by many.We had many years of fun in the pub, from New Years Eve parties (been to most of them), to the Pubbie Awards to the ugly sweater contest. Lets not forget the Battle of the Bitches, in which Stacia and I participated in 1999. I think we came in last place, but it was a blast.WhenScott & Vickiheard that Jimmy was selling the pub,they thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to buy the pubthey loved and keep the music going. And so they did it.Theytook over in February this year.They didnt advertise thatthey did, but people starting finding out naturally. Perhaps some of you are still finding out. Then just asthey were getting the hang of running a pub, only months into the new venture,they got THE CALL. The building was being sold and would to be torn down. It felt like a punch to the gut. So herethey are, facing an uncertain future.They would like to relocate but dont really have the money, sincetheyjust bought the pub.

The focus of this campaign is supporting the work Daphne Singingtree is doing in providing a space forIndigenous Healers, helping with the integration with medics on site, and sharing herbal medicines and knowledge. We have since expanded to providing support for the midwives who are arriving to care for the women who are in camp needing prenatal and birth care.  Thanks to the generous donations, we recieved the funds for gas and the rental of the uhaul for firsttrip, as well asequipment and supplies that remain in camp. We are now raising funds for the second trip as well as some specific equipment.  We are focusing on heating for the winter & safe efficient wood stoves for long term.Background. Daphneandher niece Leah Tamaraarrived at camp 9/7/16. With some initial help with a small group who drove with us we set up a space near the main camp, created a tea station serving hot tea, a space for Indigenous Healers to meet, held a Give Away for the herbal medicines donated by the supporters, as well as those from Eagletree Herbs . Many individuals as well as herb business from all over the country donated beautiful herbal products. We also created some protocols for accessing herbal needs and refering to medics as needed. We were joined by a number of other herbalists other volunteers.With Leah's help Daphne provided health and healing educational services to over 300 people, taught classes, had the children from the camp school come forstorytellingand learning about herbal medicine.We were ablecreate a space for healing as well as the powerful sharing of knowledge between indigenous healers. More warm, dry space is needed to provide support to the Water Protectorswho are preparing to stay through the winter.The original camp was adjacent to the main kitchen and was able to serve large numberof people due to the location, however with winter approaching and more people arriving atSacred Stone camp, we moved the sturdier canopy, the 12 volt solar system, and the tea station to the medic/herbal area at Sacred Stone with others to continue the work. However the access without a four wheel drive is limited at the Sacred Stone, so Leah has moved to the Rosebud Spirit camp in the tipi, and will be joined by Daphne in a few weeks where Indigenous Healing Camp and a some of the midwifery & womens health spaces will be located. Daphne is planning on returning around October 1st with supplies, her other tipi, a 36 foot school bus and other structures that will be left for the winter.Immediate NeedsThere is an immediate need for stoves safe for tents and tipis, without the risks of burning and respiratory isses that open fires can bring. While we are taking donations to buy stoves and bring them, and collecting wood stoves to bring, we need inside safe propane stoves (Mr Heater) right away, it is more efficient to send them directly via Amazon where they can be delivered in the next few days.

Since 1993, Terror on the Square, a unique haunted attraction, has entertained tens of thousands of people across Illinois, and beyond, with their ghost-like illusions and special effects throughout the month of October.Due to a lack of a sprinkler system and other new Life Safety Code requirements, this attraction was forced to close the doors of it's historical building in 2013. In the fall of 2015, a new, larger water main was installed to support a fire sprinkler system. By installing the new water main into the building while the downtown streets and sidewalks were already under construction, the bill was considerably less than first assessed. However, the installation bill still totals $8,200 due to the size of the line and amount of work to install it.Terror on the Square hopes for support from the Petersburg community, along with all its businesses and many fans to help move ahead to Phase 2 and reopen the doors of our historic downtown location, thus bringing thousands of people back to Petersburg and it's businesses.

I am creating this GoFundMe to help save my neighborhood from sheer devastation. Our neighborhood consists of two dead-end roads, located on a hillside. It may sound fancy, but we are comprised of seven modest families. We live in a small town in Oregon, in an area that has a history of severe flooding. It has not had a direct impact on us - until this weeks flood. It started with a crack in the road, that occurred sometime on Monday. By Tuesday morning, the cracks had grown and spread. The majority of the cracks are/were in front of our next-door neighbors Bob and Dee's house and driveway, which is the first house on the upper road.By that afternoon, it became clear that it was going to get much, much worse. There are two homes and a small barn situated downhill from this mess. One family, Mike and Sandy's, has three kids - twin teens and an older child in his second year of college. The other home and barn belong to John and Tara, whose only daughter is in her freshman year of college. They saw this and we immediately began evacuating their horses and whatever else we could. John and Tara are currently living out of their horse trailer.I shared this photo to Facebook. That is my husband in the hard hat, peering over the edge. My friends freaked out, thinking that this was terrible, awful. But the storm kept raging; inches and inches of rain and surface water pouring into this mess. The next morning, the situation seemed dire.The pictures don't do the damage justice. You can just make out one of us standing by the crevass, just to the right of the middle in the picture. I don't have the words to sufficiently describe it. It is massive. It goes beyond the roads - cutting across the entire hill. Drop offs of up to twenty feet, easily. The entire main road shoved at least fifteen feet downhill. Crevasses and craters and canyons galore. Everything wants to continue to move and fall. We have had geologists, contractors, and engineers come survey the damage. Everyone was blown away. To see it in person is the only way to truly grasp it. The barn down the way has been irreparably damaged, and the families still fear for their homes. The three of us on the upper road are currently isolated, as this was our one way down the hill. We are working to create a gravel driveway through the backyards to get us down to the lower road so we can get out.The flooding and damage in the local area is ongoing - so much so, that our county has been declared a State of Emergency. We have spent much of the last few days on the phone with whomever we can think of to call. The most frustrating blow - Homeowner's insurance won't help us, coming up with excuses as to why it isn't covered. The city can't help us. FEMA, whom we were counting on, won't help us either, since it's privately owned. (in the above picture, the left is Bob's driveway, while the right is the main road. You can get an idea of how much earth has moved.)We are stuck with the bill to repair our hill, and to stabilize the landslide quickly if we want to save Bob, John, and Mike's homes from the imminent threat. It is also quite possible that every home on the hill is at risk of coming down or being swept up if this were to be left to its own devices. That's what drove me to set this up. We live in a town that embodies community to its core. We are praying the community - and its branches - can help us now.Any money donated will be used directly to save what can be saved and repair what can be repaired. This is going to be a costly, lengthy process. Honestly, we believe it will cost much more than the goal of $100,000. Engineers and geologists will need to be hired to figure out the safest way to calm Mother Nature. They will bring in big expensive drills and take core samples. This process alone will cost at least $5k. They will then design a specific plan on how we go about saving the hill. The ground will have to be stabilized. Vast expanses of hillside will need extensive work with heavy machinery. Hopefully, we can do this before we have another slide. Any springs of water - of which there are many - will need to be trained and corralled into going down the hill safely. There is the chance that we will have to reshape large pieces of property. Eventually, this will need to be dug out. Potentially, with the help of professionals, we can rebuild our road. With the grace of God, the houses in the slides possible path, and the house above it, can be saved. This GoFundMe is, figuratively and literally, a lifesaver. If we can stabilize this hillside, we can save our homes. A minimum of three homes will be guaranteed to be directly saved, while the remaining four will be saved from potential future slides. Homes with families in them - children, pets, parents who work hard all day to keep it all together. Anything donated - anything - will be seen as a blessing. There truly aren't enough words to express how thankful we will be. Unendingly? Eternally? I don't feel like those words are strong enough. This is a holiday season that we will never forget - but hopefully we remember it with tears of gratitude. As I create this GoFundMe, I am listening to the rain continue to pour, and thunder boom. I can see flashes from the lightning through the window. This storm isn't over yet, and so neither is our fight. Please, help us save our homes. Help save our neighborhood.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"A car for Ms Lively,"$7,810","$10,000",Community," March 1, 2016",107,6,FAYETTEVILLE,NC,1400,6,7,"                            Sarah-Beth James                                                                                        on behalf of Mary Ellen LivelyFAYETTEVILLE, NC                                                        (Ms Lively has agreed to let us surprise her, please do not tell her we are doing so)Through the years Mary Ellen Lively has lived a life to bless others.

Hill plans to put students to work and provide open-mic forums on local and world issues.Hill hopes the GoFundMe, do-it-yourself online fundraising campaign he set in motion last month will have met its goal of $25,000 to support his move to revive authentic and mature radio programming with Thrill Hill Radio that stars listeners who freely express their views on community issues. The station, which will target ages 25-54, also will serve as a training ground for students to compete in the job market once they graduate from college.I am a product of radio during a period when personalities believed in the premise of connecting with their listening audience, Hill, a Raleigh native, said. The primary function of radio is to serve the community - not just the local community but the world-community; to share information, promote awareness and address issues. The world is our community, and radio is the voice of our community. Thrill Hill Radio will speak to the world community.Hill, 55, followed the footsteps of his godfather, well-known local radio jockey Sweet Bob Rogers. Hill landed his first radio job when he was 14 as a board operator at a classical non-profit radio station, WCPE 89.7 FM. He stayed there four years, until he entered then St. Augustines College to major in English.I loved music, and I also was very captivated by voices, Hill said. At one point, I wanted to do commercials and voiceovers, and I found out the only way to get that kind of training was to work in radio and the best way to get my foot in that door was as a board operator.When the program director recognized Hills baritone as pitch perfect for radio, he allowed the teenager to man his own on-air shift of classical jazz on Sundays. Ever since, Hill has been a mainstay, spinning tunes from gospel to R&B at stations across the Triangle from 1999 to 2009. Hill also made a name for himself during stints at other national radio stations, where he perfected his Quiet Storm Show.He returned to North Carolina in 1983. By 1986, he was back at his alma mater to launch the schools radio and television stations. Hills next stop was a position as program director at WLLE, where he catapulted the station from 26th to 10th in the market. But it was at WQOK that he became Thomas The Thrill Hill, when an inside joke  about his Quiet Storm and deep voice making female listeners swoon  stuck.For more information, visit  http://www.gofundme.com/8titjc.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"E Pluribus Unum Marketing fund,"$1,205","$3,000",Community," January 11, 2016",42,8,GRANITE FALLS,WA,1200,1,3,"                            Robert Ray                                                                                                                   GRANITE FALLS, WA                                Help support The Original Motto Project in our fight to preserve the separation of Church and State.

Not only will sponsoring Gateway to Reason benefit The Original Motto Project, it will also benefit other secular activists as the sponsorship fee is used to fund this fantastic event. Once we reach $500, we can secure our sponsorship slot and begin phase two: making sure we have enough materials to run the best possible booth we can. Our second major project is erecting a billboard in a city that is a major supporter of In God We Trust. Possible locations thus far include Springfield, Missouri and China Grove, North Carolina. Once we have raised the $2000 necessary for our billboard display, we will begin the process of selecting a final location and finalizing the design.All other funds will go towards materials and other necessities that pop up along the way. We here at The Original Motto Project understand that not everyone can be forward and outspoken about the issues we face as secularists in this country. Often, activists face being shunned by their communities, especially in more rural and religious parts of the country. Speaking out can threaten relationships and livelihoods. One way to circumvent this is to speak out with your wallet! It might be clich, but truly every single dollar helps.

First, we would do everything we could to help the families of those killed and the survivors dealing with the physical and emotional pain of being targeted in the worst anti-LGBTQ hate crime in U.S. history.You helped us keep the first promise by contributing, online and in person, more than $9M . And we have kept our word that every penny we collected - even the interest that accrued on the funds - is going to the victims of Pulse. No staff or overhead. Weve donated all of our time. On September 27th, those funds will be disbursed. Now our attention must focus entirely on fulfilling the second promise - to honor the dead with action. Thoughts and prayers and symbols are not enough. We are committed to ensuring the lasting memorial is the real change of uprooting anti-LGBTQ hatred at the source. To keep this promise, we need you with us again. Our mission for the last 19 years has been to uproot bigotry and fight for equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Florida. Indeed, we fight for freedom for all Floridians to live without fear of violence, harm to their family, being fired from a job or refused service because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.The massacre at Pulse has made this vision a priority for millions more people in the state of Florida. We have never been closer to a huge breakthrough in LGBTQ protections in a state that will have ripple effects nationally. It is time for us to demand huge strides, not tiny measures, in changing the culture and the laws in Florida to ensure we stop the discrimination and violence that anti-LGBTQ hatred makes inevitable. We are asking you now to join us in achieving two goals that are ambitious but achievable if we have the courage to stand together.Banning anti-LGBTQ discrimination in Florida and passing gun violence prevention policies in the third most populous state in the country. Florida has a long and hateful history when it comes to the treatment of LGBTQ people and has been the springboard for national anti-gay campaigns from Anita Bryant to the Liberty Counsel. Florida-based groups have not only done harm here, theyve exported their prejudice to states around the nation and other countries as well. But the tide has turned in our favor as hearts have softened and minds have opened in the wake of Pulse. Shame on us if we let this moment pass without pushing with all our might for the state to treat us all as equals under the law and to end easy access to weapons of mass slaughter.We are so very grateful to have found the resources to help these people and their families get services, make up for lost wages, heal wounds and begin to put their lives back together. Will you stand with us again and fulfill the promise of real change as the lasting memorial #ForThe49?Inspired by our work in the aftermath of Pulse, an anonymous donor will match the first $100,000 raised for this campaign. That means the gift you give today will be doubled! --------------------------Who are we? Equality Florida is an organization that has been advocating for justice and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Florida since 1997. Gold rated by the leading charity ranking websites, we have spent nearly 20 years building our communitys strength to turn the tide on some of the worst anti-gay legislation and policy in the United States: Winning marriage in advance of the Supreme Courts decision that was binding nationally; Passing dozens of city and county non-discrimination ordinances that protect more than 10 million Floridians; Enacting safe schools policies that have created welcoming and supportive environments for more than 2 million students; Shifting public opinion to help reverse the ban on gay adoption left by Anita Bryants gay-hating campaign in the 1970s. We have spent the last three months channeling direct support to Pulse victims and now are turning our attention to ridding our culture of the toxic dehumanization of LGBTQ people.--------------------------For those who prefer to send a check, please see below:Equality Florida ActionP.O.

Today several students at Richlands High School located in Richlands, Virginia, was personally called out andhumiliated, and had their food trays removed and thrown in the trash because apparently they owed more than $1.50 on their personal account. Southwest Virginia has suffered a major blow due to the closing of coal mines and job loss. Many families are struggling to survive and the only meal their children get is whatever is served at the school cafeteria. We need funds immediately and ongoing in whatever amount you will kindly donate. All funds received will go directly to a lunch fund to feed students who are unable to pay the $1.50 for lunch.  No student should have to starve while trying to get an education. Not in our back door. Thank you in advance for your kindness. Also thank you to REALTORS Lisa Cordle, Roy J Horne and Jaimie Hess for supporting this cause.

This is a very powerful message and one that should resonate with all Belizeans given the context of what has been transpiring at our southern border.What if all Belizeans came together in solidarity on September 10th, 2016 to participate in or support a massive peace pilgrimage to Belizes southern border and to Sarstoon island to respectfully assert Belizes territorial integrity?The goal would not be to provoke an armed confrontation with Guatemala(that would be made abundantly clear) nor would it be to make a partisan political statement. Yet, at the same time Belizeans should not cower nor be fearful to travel to any part of its territory.The goal would be to givenew meaning to the words of our national anthemArise ye sons of the Baymens clan, Put on your armour, clear the land! By the might of truth, and the grace of God all Belizeans need to stand up, valiantly, boldly and peacefullyto protect our heritage. What a fitting way a pilgrimage to Sarstoon island would be to commemorate the Battle of St. Georges Caye; and to pass down to future generations the courage to stand up for what is rightfully theirs, just as a handful of individuals did so very long ago. To do this properly would require a tremendous amount of planning, coordination and resources. The goal is to raise $10,000 US by June 30, 2016. If that goal is reached,anEvent Team will be quickly assembled to plan, organize, and execute this event in time for September celebrations. Donated funds will be used to cover direct costs of planning, organizing, and executing a peace pilgrimage to Sarstoon Island on or near September 10, 2016. If the goal is not reached by June 30, 2016 any funds raised will be used for a related cause. Any donors who contribute more than $100 will be acknowledged publicly unless they wish to remain anonymous. Any donors who contribute more than $500 will be listed on printed materials and t-shirts unless they wish to remain anyonymous.If you are interested in being part of the Event Team please indicate so in your comment. Coordinators and sponsorshipwill be needed for: ground transportation, boat transportation, security, venue/ceremonies, additional fundraising, food & entertainment, media/publicity, equipment & supplies.
