Jinsei (pronounced jean-say) means ""life"" in Japanese and our goal is to bring our customers back to LIFE with our nutritious juices and tonics. We want to change the way people think about food and get you feeling better than ever...and we need your help! Starting a business from scratch is the scariest thing we have ever done. We have given up everything to do this. We walked away from the security of good paying jobs a year ago to launch this business and have invested every dime into this vision. We have put our hearts and souls (literally blood, sweat and tears) into this venture and have devoted all earnings towards building the company. More on Founders here:  http://jinseijuice.com/home/about/Since launching the company a year ago, it has been our dream to grow into a brick and mortar location and we have recently been offered a great opportunity at Tyson's Corner Center in Falls Church, VA. Our hard work is close to paying off, but this next step brings enormous challenges. Tyson's Corner Center is one the top 5 most productive shopping centers in the country. So, most immediately, we need to amp up production, hire staff for the kitchen and the retail location, buy higher capacity equipment, build-out juice bar, and manage move-in costs. The up front costs of opening a location are immense and we cannot do it alone. It would mean so much to us to raise the funds needed to open this first location, and we aren't afraid to say it, WE NEED HELP!! Please consider donating to make our vision become a reality. We would be extremely thankful and appreciative of your donation. We are so close to our vision, we can taste it, pun intended! Thanks in advance to all those who have supported, guided, and helped us over the last year. It has not been easy, and we would not be in the position today with Tyson's Corner Center without the steadfast backing of family, friends, and our loyal customers.

Tomorrow we have to go to court to be ordered to hand our farm over to the bank. We have had such trying times since we sunk money into updating our farm buildings and equipment. The milk price we receive is controlled by the mega food giants and we have no say so in what it is anytime. Our pay price shrunk and we had to declare bankruptcy and we are behind in our payments .  We have been in the process of starting a cheese operation and milk bottling on our farm. We do not have any cash flow so this is tough going. We have our cheese equipment due to a grant we qualified for, they paid half and we paid the rest. We still need our pasturization equipment for the bottling. We are at a standstill due to financial constraints. The bank is calling our loan tomorrow. We have no way out. This farm has been in our family for going on 5 generations. Our goal is to keep the farm fluid for our kids to continue farming. We love this old place. It is our home and livelihood. It is home to our dairy cows, chickens, turkeys, and our future. It is a beautiful and peaceful place that was obtained by the sweat of our family's brow. My father was a child when he started milking cows to keep from picking cotton. He had a couple cows and a bull. He carried the milk to the highway in buckets and left it for Carnation Milk to pick it up. Everyday. His father helped get more cows and that is when the dairy was started. My mother and father milked in our parlor together for as long as they were able. They worked their fingers to the bone making sure they were good stewards of the land they owned. They worked very hard to keep the farm going and it breaks our heart knowing we have failed them and ourselves. We do not want to lose our farm. There are very few small family farms left in this country. The small farmer has no way to compete with the big boys so they go out of business. If you look around you will see all these empty dairy parlors and barns. There used to be so many and now there are so few. Many people are just a generation or two away from a farming background. No better place to raise a family. We ask for your help to keep our farm from being made into a housing development. Please help us to continue farming the land and keeping family farms growing. We are desperate and not very proud of having to ask for help this way. We see no light at the end of the tunnel without your help. God has blessed us with this farm and we pray that you will consider helping us.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Send Us to SU Global Summit,$285,"$1,000",Business," August 3, 2016",9,1,SAN JOSE,CA,2800,,1,"                            Aisa Mijeno                                                                                                                   SAN JOSE, CA                                My name is Aisa Mijeno, I come from the Philippines.

I had never really thought about doing metal art until I saw it at a Farmers Market several years ago, but after seeing it I knew I wanted to make it, so my awesome Mom loaned me some money for my plasma cutting table and I was on my way. Since I had no idea what to expect, I started out on the smallest cnc table which is 2' x 2' but it was advertised as not a machine for a business, but more for the ""weekend warrior"" type of person.Having never even used a cnc machine, it was a bit of a learning process but I caught on quick. I really wanted to get into making the state of Michigan themed items, so I started designing a few things and soon started a Facebook page. I remember getting excited once I got a few ""likes"" and soon after a few orders.After that it is kind of a blur because I seemed to be getting pretty popular real fast, so I called my brother Rob and asked him if he wanted to powder coat for me. So, we are basically 2 guys working from our garages, me in Honor and my brother in Gaylord.Fast forward to now, where we have almost 25,000 Facebook fans, sell wholesale to around 35 stores and have even done work for the Governor of MI.The problem we are having is we can't make orders fast enough to keep up with current demand , and we cannot grow because our limited equipment. I still use the 2' x 2' cutting table, and I woud think most companies who do this for a living use at least an 8' x 4' table and can produce 10 times what I can in a day. We are also at a big disadvange doing powder coating because my brother uses 2 regular household ovens to bake the parts, so this slows us down in the number of things we can do at once and the sizes. If we can reach our goal, I would be able to at least get a 4' x 4' table, and we could also get a regular nice size powder coating oven. My real dream is to play with the big boys and get an 8' x 4' table and an actual plasma cutter made for putting out a lot of product, but that would be closer to $20,000 so I can't be greedy..lol  But, if each one of our fans donated just $1 we could really do something special!Not only do we need to upgrade to buy equipment to keep up with demand, but it would also help bigtime in putting out an even higher quality product, and pleasing our customers with quick service, and higher quality is our ultimate goal. We would also be able to expand into doing bigger pieces, and also many other ideas I have...but impossible to do right now.Another goal I have been dreaming of since day 1 is to open a metal art store in Traverse City, and be able to hire a few employees. I am 100% confident we could do this, and even expand into other cities down the rd. and hire even more employees.As you can see in the picture above, our business all hinges on that tiny CNC table. It is impossible to do much more, and it is starting to break down on me. We  NEED your help to make all this happen, and it WILL happen if we can get the right equipment. Remember, just $1 from each of our Facebook fans, friends and family could make all our dreams a reality.

We have created a better way of preventing hot car deaths than what is on the market today. A sensor under the carseat cannot detect other people and pets that are in the car and not in the carseat. This kind of sensor has one major problem, it is subject to human error. The consumer needs to install it and it can become unreliable because it is subject to movement and the various liquids a child comes in contact with and produces. The device we have created, is not just a sensor and does not go under the seat; it would be factory installed, eliminating the need for setup or installation by the consumer. Our device has the potential to save every life, human or pet, young and old, in extreme temperatures. Help us get this device to the next level so we can save as many lives as possible. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Micro-Farm With Us! ,"$1,175","$250,000",Business," January 28, 2014",29,32,GRAHAM,WA,38000,,3,"                            Andrea Kuska                                                                                                                   GRAHAM, WA                                You have probably, at least once in your life, seen a horrifying video of where your food comes from. Be it a flashy advertisement from an organization dedicated to animal welfare, or a documentary on food, the animals we get our food come from have been in the spotlight for the last couple of decades.Unfortunately, factory farming is still the norm. Day old chicks are still run through meat grinders alive, adult laying hens still have their beaks amputated and have to live in tiny cages, and other animals such as pigs suffer even worse treatment. We have come a long way from the idealistic family farm, and it has not been a good trip.Fluffy Butt Farms would like to change all that. We are dedicated to bringing back the family farm, and proving that happy chickens can be just as economically feasible as miserable ones. We plan to offer eggs from pastured chickens. By pastured, we mean chickens who have access to a coop and grass, and can easily choose either. Pasture being defined as actual grass, and other edible plants. A coop being defined as a comfortable, spacious area to lay eggs and roost in. No beak amputations, no crowding, clean (GMO free, organic) food and water on top of pasture.Not only do we want to offer this to our chickens, we would like to make it possible for everyday people to be able to visit the farm, and see for themselves how the chickens are treated. It's wonderful to see a photo of a chicken on grass. It's another to see them actually there and know that's what they get all the time.Unfortunately, the cost of starting up a farm is relatively high. Purchasing land, chickens, and fencing all cost a significant amount of money. We estimate needing at least $250,000 in order to afford a farm with enough space to free-range the chickens, land to grow some of their supplemented food, and to build fencing and coops.We would appreciate your help in bringing this farm into the world.

Those mortgages were paid off twelve years later through a fundraiser - the annual Holiday Tour of Homes - which continues today. When the ladies acquired the Dulaney House it was completely run down and overrun by trees and bushes (picture coming). They saw the great bones, though, and 40 years of volunteer work and community funding have created a beautifully restored house that is part of toursand living history presentations at Chestnut Square. In 2013 the Chestnut Square Executive Director, Cindy Johnson, proposed a project toThe Heritage GuildBoard of Directors to make the Dulaney House into a bed and breakfast. The three other bed and breakfasts in McKinney are at capacity and turnpeople away. Chestnut Square has a booming wedding business (90 weddings were held at the Village in 2013) andcouples have asked for a place to stayat the village during their wedding weekends for years.Just two blocks offof a thriving downtown square, the Dulaney House is uniquely positioned to become a successful Inn.As ahouse on tours, the property costs $12,000-15,000 each year to maintain. As an Inn servicing the McKinney downtown area, it wouldprovide maintenance fundingfor itself and net proceeds of $40,000 to the other buildings andgrounds at Chestnut Square. In addition, a live in caretaker would provide added security for the historic village. Chestnut Square Historic Village has grown over the years to 2.5 acres and ten buildings including a 1908 Chapel, 1908 grocery store, the oldest house in McKinney built in 1854, a stagecoach inn built in 1864 and a replica of the first public schoolhouse in McKinney. The Historic McKinney Farmers Market is held each Saturday from 8:00 a.m. until noon on the grounds. Voted the #1 market in Texas, it regularly brings in more than 1,500 visitors on a Saturday. Other events include The Killis Melton Ice Cream Crank-Off, the Legends of McKinney Ghost Walks, Summer Prairie Adventure Camps and more!The project was presentedto the McKinney Community Development Corporationand was funded with $150,000 in grant money.The Heritage Guild of CollinCounty built a budget for the project on the $150,000 grant plus $20,000 in fundraising from theannual Holiday Tour of Homes (2013 was our 40th anniversary and the tour was even bigger and better than ever. Recenttours had raised $25,000+) Unfortunately a historic, once in a lifetimeice stormshut down North Texas the weekend of the Home Tour and we only netted $6,000 from the event. We'reasking you, our supporters and fans, to help us raise the shortfall so that the project can go on as planned and the Dulaney Inn can open inFall, 2014. To thank you for your donation, we're offering free week-night stays at the Inn in 2015.

We have the opportunity to purchase an already successful cage-free dog boarding business,in Northern California. For those of you that know me, the opportunity to be my own boss, work with dogs all day, and expand the business to include a nonprofit rescue/shelter is a DREAM! If you dont know Jen and James, here is a little background on why helping us is helping dogs! Married for almost 8 years, James and I met while I was the Animal Center Manager and he was the Senior Field Services Officer. It was passion at first sight and that passion for each other and for dogs has only increased in time.After 3 years as an Animal Center Manager in 2006 with the Rancho Cucamonga Animal Care and Adoption Center, I took a position as the Los Angeles Programs Manager with the Best Friends Animal Society, and was promoted 18 months later to Senior Manager of the Pet Adoption Center and Spay/Neuter Clinic. I have also worked as the Director of Kern County Animal Control and the Vice President of Training Programs at Cesar Millans Dog Psychology Center, all the while training dogs on the side as part of my business, Woofing It. Along with my professional experience I have an undergraduate degree in Animal Science, a graduate degree in wildlife ecology, and received my M.B.A in 2011. I have been told by everyone who knows me that I was born to be with animals and have followed that personal and professional dream through my whole life. James spent 11 years working as an Animal Control Officer, becoming an expert in aggressive dog calls. His compassionate and innate ability with all dogs set him apart in his career. James became the one to go to if there was a shy dog, an aggressive dog or any with behavioral concerns. He has that natural ability with dogs and is amazing at customer service. Together we make a formidable team ready to tackle a booming business and dedicate our lives to enriching dogs (and their peoples) lives! In the short future we plan to give back and provide help to the local shelter and rescues and hopefully start our own nonprofit in the next 1-2 years. Mostly we look forward to creating an amazing business and being those people who are doing what we love. We are trying to raise $7,000 as a down payment. We have already raised $15,000!

We set out to make a very small ramp that our customers could ride around on, but ended up doing something way more crazy. We have built the skeleton, which is 2.5ft x 15ft, with an 8ft transition. We scrapped an entire section of our showroom to build this massive mini ramp. Once the ramp itself is complete, there will be building costs to enclose / separate the mini room from the rest of the shop, for obvious safety reasons. To finish the mini ramp and enclose the room, it will be around $1500 in materials. We will be building everything with friends and family, so installation costs will be none to minimal. We will be investing as much of our own money as possible into this, as we divested inventory to build what we currently already have done.We want to create a fun shop for the northeast ohio skate and scooter scene that features much more than just the leading brands and products.Anyone who donates $5 or more will receive free ride(s) on the mini after it's finished. The amount of free rides will depend on how much you donate. (We will be charging $5 per hour or at least a $10 purchase to ride when it opens, so every five you donate will equal an hour towards the mini). If you are donating and are not in the state of ohio, we'll send some cool vibes your way and love you long time. ;]Excape Sports has been open since March 1st 2016 and have been constantly evolving everyday to make the shop better and better.

Sincewe started serving the Tyler Texas community in 2008, we have grown in so many different capacities. We have trained thousands of students and have been blessed to touch so many lives with our message and training in self defense. We are at a point of exponential expansion and could use your help. We have out grown our current training facility and are moving to a new location. Starting April 1st we will begin construction at 1749 Troup Hwy. which is still in the Green Acres Shopping Center here in Tyler Texas and will be 4,500 sq/ft.As ETKM has already helped so many people all over the region we have had the staff and instructors to do so much more. With this move we will be able to equip those instructors to lead many more students in many ways. Some of those ways we are listed below:1. Archangels Project Seminars and Projects (combating human trafficking)2. Firearms training3. Fitness Program (Bootcamps, Heavy-bag Fitness (Kickboxing) , TRX, and much more)4. Law Enforcement Training5. Krav Maga for youth program6. More Seminars for community7. Advanced Krav Maga training8. Nutritional consultationswithLive Fit Be Healthy 9. Much More!What are we going to use the funds raised for?1. Building materials for a top level training facility2. HVAC system to ensure comfortable training environment3. Heavy Bag Rack and Pull up Rig4. New Mats on floor and walls5. New Gear such as thai pads, long guns, and moreThis move will give ETKM two training floors as well as other tools that will be a better overall training experience for our students and community alike. You will see multiple classes going on at once including a dedicated Fitness Program, our ETKM Firearms training courses, Krav Maga for youth, Nurtitional consultation, and much more. Our mission is to give our students the best training available so the can make our community safer.Krav Maga helps make our community safer. Each person who trains in Krav Maga participates in a struggle for goodness and decency in our community. Krav Maga promotes self confidence, problem-solving, and an ability to face the facts of difficult situations.The truth is, every Krav Maga student is a warrior in the fight for a strong, healthy community. You dont have to pick up a rifle or charge the enemy. The fight is not that obviousbut trust me, you are in the middle of it right now. Terms such as self discipline and virtue  even the words goodness and decency used in at the beginning of this article  are in danger of becoming old-fashioned. If these terms survive, they will do so because we continue to exemplify them. But we must not just say them, we must live them. Therein lies the difference between the politician and the warrior. The politician talks about an idea. The warrior lives it.In this sense, every Krav Maga student is a warrior, even the frailest man or woman learning self defense for fitness or personal achievement. Each of us is practicing to discipline his mind and body, to set goals and achieve them, and to treat others with a measure of respect, and insist on that respect from others. The more of us that live that lifestyle, the safer our community becomes.Thank you for your support,ETKM Staff & Instructors                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help Us Launch Our Food Truck,$650,"$2,000",Business," October 30, 2014",7,23,BROOKFIELD,WI,84000,,3,"                            Jonna Clark Aprahamian                                                                                                                   BROOKFIELD, WI                                                        Please consider helping us launch our food truck venture.

So you can imagine how our kitchen is filled with aromas from all over the Sea. We are aTyphoon of Flavors that fuse together to create our own unique Menu. Our Menu consists of Chamorro, Puerto Rican , Mexican and Classic American Food made into a Fusion of flavors. Food for us is our passion, its so much more than just giving food for money. It is important to spread our unique cultures, Family unity, and Island way of life that we have been taught by our elders growing up.We have both chose to quit our fulltiime 9-5pm jobs and focus solely on our business while my husband still works partime . As a family of 7, we are able to share this journey with our own children and teach them our importance of our culture, hospitality,, and famiilly unity.Therefore, we are reaching out to all of our supporters, friends and family for any donations to help us reach our goal.

Sweet, complicated, and still unnamed you. You will love me through it all and you will still love me well."" - Love Me Well, Twenties Unscripted April 2016The StoryBack in January, I sat at a a Tapas restaurant with one of my friends and told her that 2016 was the year I would be open to love. When I said it, I thought I was sending some sort of signal to the Universe that I was ready for that life-changing, earth-shattering kind of love to sashay my way.But, the Universe had something entirely different in mind.Instead, declaring this as a year I would be open to love has meant a swirl of incredible, palpable, and authentic love circling in my orbit.It's no coincidence that the love around me has been beautiful, blossoming black love.Black love is both interesting and intoxicating at a time such as this. Its personal and political. Its rare and revolutionary. Its simultaneously widely celebrated while remaining viciously attacked. Black love is the tapestry of emotions we feel when we listen to LEMONADE. It's the trumpet of pride that sounds through us when we look at The Obamas on the cover of Essence. But, black love is also alive and well among every day, real people. I believe the world needs to consume some of those black love stories now more than it ever has before.And, I believe in the vision at the bottom of my belly to tell some of black love stories through Twenties Unscripted.The ProjectLove Me Well is a limited edition multimedia series debuting on Twenties Unscripted that aims tocelebrate and elevate black love. The series, premiering during fall 2016, will tell the story of nine different couples at various junctures of their love journeys. Through photography and both written and podcast interviews, each couple will showcase their individuality and share a significant thread of their love story.These couples will delve into topics at the epicenter of their unions, including:Black love in a 21st century of black turmoilCultivating authentic and effective communicationThe role of God and spirituality in a relationshipBuilding trust and transparencyNurturing a family and raising childrenBridging gaps in ageand backgroundBalancing careersCross-cultural black loveJuxtaposing black womanhood with vulnerability in a relationshipThe AskHowever,I certainly can't produce this project alone.After four years at the helm ofTwenties Unscripted, I have learned in the unparalleled power of tapping into the community you've built. Of leaning on your tribe. Of asking for help when you need it. Multimedia projects suchas Love Me Well are the lifeblood of my brand, and it often times requires significant financial resources to pull them off.Every contribution to the Love Me Well campaign will be used to offset the production costs of this project. This includes costs for:Studio rentalEquipment for photo shoots and podcast interviewsTravel to photograph and interview couplesPhoto editing feesThank you from the tips of my toes and the bottom of my belly for being a part of not only this project, but this movement.Let's show the world just how extraordinary everyday black love really is.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"The Benjamin Beer Co.

I am trying to raise money to help others who feel as if suicide is their only option. This means alot to me because I've been there before. I attempted suicide by overdose because I was constantly bullied in the past and I felt worthless. I also lost a close friend to suicide at an early age. So I know how heartbreaking it is to lose someone to it as well. She didn't show up at school didn't answer any of my calls so I left school early to go to her house and see what was wrong only to walk in and find her. I often blame myself for not being a better friend and not going to her house earlier. My failed attempt of suicide opened my eyes to see that I am here to serve a purpose, which is uplifting others by reminding them that they matter and that they are loved. I am trying to start a program that will allow people of any age to join. The program will take trips, have events, group counseling sessions and more. This is just the beginning of ideas that I have. I'm hoping to have an event next week which is suicide prevention week. Please from the kindness of your hearts please help me in making my vision come to life. It would be greatly appreciated.

A part of my dream is to own a quick service restaurant. WHY? Because I want to create a stable income, hire Veterans and then pay it forward by helping other Veterans own their own quick service restaurant. I have partnered with a Veteran that owns Biggies Burgers and Great Shakes in San Clemente, California and he is working with me to establish a Biggie's Burgers and Great Shakes in San Antonio under his program Sunrise Warriors. Learn more at SunriseWarriors.comWith the money raised, I will be able to secure an existing building, attain necessary equipment, get my training andget the restaurant up and running. Any money left over will be put in a fund toward supporting another veteran in getting their own restaurant up and running.My goal is to have the funds raised by May 2016. I have already found my desired location in San Antonio.By accomplishing this, I can set the expample to other Veterans dealing with PTSD or other ailments, amputees and burn victims, that you can overcome, persevere and prevail. In the military, it is always Lead by Example, so I am stepping up to be the example so others can follow and believe it can be done.A big part of who I am is about giving back. I live to support others, now I am asking for support in my dream.

Quite an honor i must tell you. Not only is the vegetarian/vegan food excellent so is our other food.I am sure we will be recognized for our Pot Roast or Italian Beef and even great appetizers like the Fried Cheese Curds or Fried Pickles etc.Food is our #1 priority. We've put together great events like the Metal Market where other vendors come in and sell shirts, vinyl, CDs etc. some from their personal collections and also artists selling some of their great artwork. Events like record release/listening parties, birthday parties and recently the Latino Metal night.We have planned great things on the horizon as well, so many more things to happen and enjoy as a community.Those of you who have come to the restuarant know just how special it is. Unfortunately business is not where it should be. Metal Haven Grill is out of money. I am asking for money to help pay the bills, keep the place open and if i can get enough than possibly apply for a liquor license (currently we are BYOB).Those of you who have not been yet, this is a way you can show support. Everyone else, you know just how unique the Metal Haven Grill is.Not just for Chicago but for the entire United States. There is really nothing like it. For those of you from around the country who have been in visiting Chicago, i need your support, those of you who never been from around the country, i know you want a place like Metal Haven Grill in your town/city. Support to keep it alive.Even the local community in Logan Square have embraced the restaurant. Why? not because of the music but the food. They love the food, check out the Yelp reviews. The food stands on its own.Those of you who know me, know the heart and soul i have put into this project. This project has been in works for years and i have done tons of research and studying to do this thing right. I have to say its come out pretty close to my vision. Look at what has been accomplished:- incredible rare original artwork- extremely rare records on the wall- nicely put together restaurant, color scheme, branding etc.- diverse delicious menu with home made in house recipes and love put into the food- small record store within the restauranteverything has come together beautifully due to the diligence and research that went into it.This is a labor of love not only for myself but for the metal community. The Chicago metal scene deserves a place like this, it would be a shame if it went away.I am looking for anything you can spare, even if its $5 or $10, if 1,000 of you donate than that adds up.If you can donate more than great, that would get me closer to the goal.i am looking for $25,000. This should be able to pay the bills for a while and possibly enough to apply for a liquor license. Obviously i have alot more than that outstanding in loans and bills but at this point i will take whatever i can get.If you know someone with disposable income or wants to support a worthwhile cause, show them this Gofundme page or bring them to the restaurant so they could see for themselves. This place is the real deal, real restaurant with real good food with real friendly staff with really good metal music.Like i said theres bigger and better things on the horizon but not without the funds to get us there.I am asking not just for myself but for my brilliant staff and the Chicago metal community to please keep this place alive.

It is a place families can come together for classes, massage, acupuncture, midwifery care, chiropractic care and more! It is owned and operated by Sunshine Tomlin, LM , a midwife practicing in Santa Cruz and the surrounding areas since 2005. Her vision includes making out of hospital midwifery care accessible to families, even those who don't want to or can't have a homebirth.What is a freestanding birth Center? Birth centers offer comfortable place for childbirth, under the care of a midwife. She provides prenatal care, postpartum care, and well woman care in addition to attending the births of the babies. It's a place where people choose to go to be in control of their own experience, where interventions are avoided whenever possible, and food and drinks are encouraged during labor.How will your donations help? Opening a freestanding Birth Center is a monumental undertaking. Furniture must be purchased to furnish 2500 sq feet of office and birthing spaces. This includes everything from beds and dressers to forks and spoons. We also want to update and paint the inside of the building, This is an estimated cost of $5,000. Equipment must be purchased, including medications, oxygen tanks, and dopplers that will be used during the birthing process, as well as sheets, pillows, and comforters. A permit is required to use the office after regular business hours. This has an application fee of $2300, plus architectural floor plans and building elevations must be drawn up. We also want to renovate: removing carpet and adding hardwood, adding showers, andpermanent tubs ensuite. Any funds we raise above and beyond the expenses of opening and operating the birth center will be used to fund a scholarship account so we can offer a sliding scale to underserved and low income families.

I have been an owner and operator of the bar called Cannon River Inn located in Welch, MN. Since 1984. I am 61 years old and Ive worked the bar 7 days a week for 32 years. There is no retirement plan or pension that goes with this profession. Cannon River Inn currently serves 3.2 wt. beer, Appetizers, Burgers and Pizzas. This building has a real deep history. There is no recorded date to be found for when this building was built or who originally started Cannon River Inn. The abstract starts in 1855.Welch used to be a flourishing town back in its day. It is well on its way to becoming another ghost town. The small village of Welch has less than 50 people. The only year round businesses are the Trout Scream Caf which used to be Welch Bank; Cannon River Inn; and the Welch United States Post Office. The town is struggling to keep its post office. Welch has two Seasonal businesses; Welch Mill Tubing & Canoe which was the town Mill & Welch Village Ski Area. There is also a bicycle trail and a state snow mobile trail that goes through. Welch has already lost its 200 campsite Campground which was called Hidden Valley Campground. The loss of the campground was detrimental to this business.  For many years I have struggled to continue running. My establishment runs primarily on tourism. I am constantly at Mother Natures mercy. The locals have requested that I put in wine, liquor, 5% vol. beer and have events on the weekends. For the past few years I have watched many tourists walk in and walk out our door because I only have 3.2 wt. beer. Three fourths of our surrounding local community does not frequent my establishment because I do not have what they want. I decided this was the year to turn this around and it was no longer avoidable to make the necessary changes. I have been trying since February 2016 to make this happen. The goal was to have it in place before summer. Unfortunately, Every time I take a step forward I go three steps backwards. All of the funds available when I decided to put in liquor were quickly depleted by my new insurance companys requirements. Small businesses like mine will agree with me that although you know how or know someone, a lot of these fixes you are not allowed to do yourself. You are required to hire top dollar certified technicians to do the job. The 2016 summer season ended terribly due to the high water levels of the river and frequent rain. On top of funds needed to put in the liquor and liquor inventory; I am now in dire straits due to the following issues:  Weekly equipment break downs all of the 2016 spring and summer season Central air unit breaking down Furnace needing replacing  Floor & Sink replacement for the State Health Department The need for equipment upgrades.Society is not the same as it was 30 years ago. The majorityare no longer beer drinkers. Im trying to give everyone what they want so that this business can survive. I have inquired with several financial institutions but unfortunately it is virtually impossible to obtain a loan if you own a bar or restaurant. The story is always the same. The current average for new bars or restaurants make for it one year and in the eyes of the banks it doesnt matter how many years you have been in business. It is too high risk  Due to all of the businesses similar to ours shutting down they will not take the building as collateral for the loan. I am reaching out for help. This is no Joke  this is not a Scam  this is Reality. I am one of many in serious financial trouble with nowhere to turn to for financial help. If you choose not to donate to my cause please make a point of frequenting your surrounding small town businesses. All of us need you to survive.

You will have the names badge numbers of any and all officers. Read reviews on city officals, rate them, see all their complaints, community outreach and much moreETO stands forEquality, Transparency and Obligation.How does ETO work?The app has three main function, social element, knowledge base, and capturing. ETO is going to help build a data base of basic information (name, physical description, etc.) all the way down, to personal information (proof of identification). This information is stored and never shared by ETO with third party organizations, nor is it subjected to other users. All ETO certified users would be given code names (Quick Snail, Bigger Bear, beautiful gem etc.) as a layer of protection from other users. Based on the viewing level, users (privacy setting) can determine how much information is let out to the public. ETO will run on a map surface of your area, using geo spatial analysis to target, and place people on your map (real time is not idea but an option). This can also be used to see major events going on (fundraiser, community serves and other community-based actives) in the area, with an option to check in and meet new members. ETO can be used to view ETO contact, altercations and case files (via public records or ETO certified user release).Civilian profiles will be different compared to law enforcement, fire fighters, city officials, and organization officials profiles. Non civilian will have special profiles that will give you and ETO certified look at this person (transparency), displaying information like Name, Photo, Badge number, Superior officer, Department, Years on force, ETO Certification, Civilian Ranking, ETO certified Altercation (public charity, fundraisers, speechs), hobbies, best day on the job, goals, mission statement, and etc. It will be a very open and up-front exchange of information. Granting civilians the ability to you in a very human form (majority of this information can be gathered with research, but ETO brings it all to one place. This level of transparency is difficult to take in at first because you are putting yourself in the light. Although with the right application I think people will all agree knowing the face and name of our officials on this level is comforting, courageous and a step in the right direction. The goal is to make people on both sides comfortable and with that comes better out comes with each encounter. The Know is a section of the application that helps city officials explain how certain situations should be handled. The officers that are ETO certified would give advice on how civilians should handle every day interaction with officers (traffic stops, questioning, emergency call out, and assisting). The Know also will use geo spatial analysis to give you the most update version of the laws. It will break down complex laws and explain it at a basic level. The Know will help you handle situations and better evaluate the law. The know will have the job (obligation) of educating people about things that could better their way of life.Capture is the ability of all ETO certified user civilians and city officials to upload, pictures, and video to ETO (and eventually other social media apps). This can be used to demonstrate, proper way to handle a distress call, city figures giving advice, volunteering, charity work, distress calls and build up trust through video application. Since most officer and their vehicles are constantly recording their interactions, most officers should be ok or learning to accept that they are public figures that can be recorded. The objective of the capturing is to show off our city officials and give them due recognition for those unseen good deeds. Only ETO certified people can upload captured moments and this can be circulated through the community to acknowledge the city official.Why will Civilians and City Officials use ETO?ETO certified people are people we trust, and with that trust comes the ability to help build your community. Civilians, who are ETO certified, will have the ability to build undocumented Officers ETO profile. For example an undocumented officer pulls over ten ETO certified civilian users and each adds information about the officer: Picture description will lead to more information about the undocumented profile Name John Doe Badge number video of a police stop comment of the captured  Undocumented officer rating, goes up which reflexes how ETO users see you in the community (approval rating) Supervisors contact info, uploaded. People call on your behalf to recognize your work. Kind act performed documented Charity function check-in Volunteer function photo check-inAll of a sudden, this undocumented officer is now fleshed out and civilian ETO users are able to put a name, face, video, department etc. To this person, this is not to put pressure but rather give every officer a chance to portray himself or herself the way they want. In addition, officers can have their undocumented profiles deleted and replaced with their own ETO certificated profile, they submit. Thus, giving them the ability to choose which photos and information from the old profile they like to carry on. To the new profile ETOs PillarsEquality, Transparency and obligation these are the three pillars of ETO. They are moral codes I live by and teach. These pillars will restore trust. ETOs main objective is to restore trust. Trust is essential to all relationships it has been said that trust can make or break any relationship. Trust is not given it is earned. ETO will put users on equal playing fields with city officials so they can see, who protects them, understand how they do it, and more importantly witness them actively doing good for the community.Why now?In 2015, nationwide we experienced a decline in overall crime, and overall police fatalities. This is a great stat and deserves to be recognized. Although with all this positivity, the country experienced a chain of heart break with the toll of unarmed civilians being killed in America. These victims were Caucasian, African American, Latin, Indian and Asian. All killed by officers. In an effort to reduce that number in the coming years I want to get ETO up and running to help bring about a change. This change must come on both sides; civilians must educate themselves and better understand their rights. Civilians must become more active in the community and the law enforcement world. This is not the platform to judge the officers or civilians involved. nor is this the platform to argue my beliefs or personal opinion, ETO is here to give people on both sides of the field a chance to come before each other and move forward together in a positive light. How can you help? I hope the reason you are here and the reason you are still reading is that you believe in my vision. You feel, you have the power to make a difference and most importantly, you understand that money can fuel this dream of mines. I also understand that this is my dream and you may not be able to help, now but someday soon you could and I want you too. Although, If you cannot I ask you to please share this with someone you think could help. I ask you to talk about ETO with your family, friends, co-workers, city leaders and if you cannot send me, their contact I will talk to them. I ask you to think about the good that could come from ETO and how much we as a nation need some resolve. You can donate if you are able; I will continue to push this dream to reality and hope to see the result in the near future.

I provide all the financial support to enable my beautiful girlfriend to be a stay at home mom. Although we prefer her to be home with our daughters rather than strangers at a daycare, the cost of childcare for two infants would cancel out her salary and she would literally work just to pay for someone else to care for them with nothing left to spare. I recently had to give up my dream job due to new management and six months later, the business is up for sale. I am attempting to see if I can raise the money to save the park, become the entrepreneur I've always aspired to be, and live the American Dream while owning my own company, driven by my own hard work, blood, sweat and tears. I'd like to share some background information. It all started about 10 years ago. I had been friends with Matt and his brother Chris, they both were not skateboarders in any way, but I was determined to teach them how to skateboard, so I took my time and I slowly started teaching them how to longboard. Then they started getting better and we gradually moved to parking garages. After one late night of skating we went back to his fathers house, the owner of Metro Gymnastics, he then asked us what we were all so sweaty from? They said, Doug taught us how to ride down parking garages. A year or so goes by and I come back over and he says, Doug how about you come to work for me. I looked at him like he was crazy I said, No my man I don't do the whole tights thing. Then he said, No Doug I want to open a skateboard school and I want you to teach and to Matt run the front desk. I told him right there and then I would be so down for the job. After a few months went by his dad then called me over to an empty warehouse. I then realized how real it was getting. Next thing you know he is calling me with opening dates and said, Come here I'll pay you more than you'd make where youre at now. There was still a lot to be done, I then quit where I was working and started preparing for the opening, getting my hands dirty, grinding the floor smooth, building ramps with Tony Massiano and crew. Not too long after it was time for opening day, not only was it opening day but my birthday too, I was so grateful. It worked out great but as we all know family and work don't mix well. So Matt took a new career path. I continued to work hard at the park because I loved the atmosphere and the kids. It unofficially became my park, I ran it as if it was my own and if you had been there any time in the last 6 years youd have met me or seen me doing my thing there. I had put in some workweeks of 70 hours or more, only asking for a 35-40 hours a week; I went above and beyond for the park, the kids, parents, and all involved. I was just a dedicated skater working hard to generate enough to pay my bills while doing what I loved most. Sadly, new management was hired and they cut all my hours back, as well as the retail hours, which in actuality limits income for the park. But now the park is up for sale and I want to own and run it like it was intended, by skaters for skaters. SO PLEASE HELP ME GET THE DREAM JOB I HAD BACK AND HELP ME BECOME THE OWNER IN HOPES OF LEAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE CENTRAL FLORIDA SKATE SCENE AGAIN.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Get Dave back cooking!,"$11,300","$21,000",Business," May 6, 2016",135,4,EVANSTON,IL,681000,2,17,"                            Sara Glatt                                                                                                                   EVANSTON, IL                                                                                Im Sara Glatt, daughter of the infamous Dave who had owned and operated Evanston's legendary Dave's Italian Kitchen for 44 years.

You may know us as The Hudson Valley Office of Capital Region Midwifery. Unfortunately, due to our committment to taking all insurances including Medicaid which does not reimburse for services adequately, our parent company has had to make a difficult business decision to close our Kingston office. Over the course of our short year in business, we have had the privilege of caring for women from all walks of life. We have ""caught"" babies, provided gynecological care, primary care, and support for women and girls as young as age 7 up through age 67 and we are honored to have done so.Unfortunately, due to the timing of our office closing on August 1, we will have pregnant patients who will be left without prenatal care, labor and delivery services, and postpartum care through December. After exhausting many different possibilities, we have found ourselves without a home base and are in the process of setting up an independent midwifery and womens health care service on our own. The costs to set up shop are much more than we anticipated and we are asking for your support. We are lucky enough to be doing deliveries at Kingston Hospital in mid-town Kingston. For those of you who aren't aware, Kingston New York is an urban population center. Although we have patients who travel from all over the mid-hudson valley to obtain our services, our base is the city of Kingston where 38.1% of families live in poverty according to the 2015 Poverty Report issued by New York State Community Action. We believe all women deserve midwifery care and this is one of the reasons why we remain performing deliveries at the Kingston Family Birthplace at Kingston Hospital. The facility is Ulster County's best kept birth option secret. They are Baby Friendly, have water birth options, and a phenominal nursing staff. With the money we collect from your generous donations, we will be able to purchase malpractice insurance, pay our billing company, afford office space, supplies, and run day to day operations in order to make sure our pregnant patients have care and to provide womens healthcare services for the underserved. We would like to meet our goal by July 15 to provide seamless care for our exisiting patients.Our goal as midwives is not only to provide stellar healthcare services for women, it is also to ensure that women have a voice and a say in their own healthcare choices. A typical visit for routine gynecological care with us is about 45 minutes and we are mostly listening, not talking. It is our goal to protect all of our patients dignity, no matter what their background, income or sexual orientation may be. Megan and Liz would like to thank you in advance, no matter what you are able to donate. We would also like to hear from you what services you would like to see implemented in our practice. Our practice is your practice so please let us know. We are forever grateful for your love, kind words, and support.

Beginning on Saturday, February 7, I will be walking 1,034 miles from Kissimmee, Florida, the site of the annualUDITOA Drive-In Owners Convention, to Camden, New Jersey, where theworld's first drive-in opened on June 6, 1933. The backpacking journey is expected to take as long as six weeks.Why I am doing this? Well, I definitely need the exercise, but there's a lot more to the story.Over the years, I have witnessed countless drive-in theatres close and be sold for development, or sit unused and forgotten. Hundreds and thousands of drive-ins have closed around the United States over the past several decades, with the property they sit on being redeveloped for ""higher use."" The most recent upswing in drive-in related closures is being facilitated by a different and more alarming reason.As if seasonal drive-in theatres didn't already have enough going against them, technological changes in the way new movies are shown on their screens is requiring all theatres to replace 35mm projectors with expensive digital equipment, at a cost of roughly $75,000 per screen. Drive-ins which cannot financially afford the transition will eventually be forced to go dark.I feel very fortunate in that my drive-in is located in a region where the population base is large enough to support making this investment, which for us was an outlay of $300,000 for all four of our screens to go digital in 2012. Drive-ins located in rural, less densely populated areas are having a much more difficult time.These mainly seasonal, small town, family operated, mom-and-pop drive-in operators simply do not generate the amount of revenue necessary to afford the transition to digital projection. They don't run their drive-ins to get rich, and some struggle from year-to-year just to remain open. In most situations, the drive-in operation is a secondary income to their main, full-time jobs during the daytime. They run their drive-ins out of passion for the outdoor movie experience, and a desire to provide their communities with affordable family-oriented entertainment.In the entire United States, the number of operational drive-ins at the end of 2014 fell to around 330 locations, down from around 350 sites only one year earlier. More family owned, rural drive-ins are expected to close over the next few years, as the supply of 35mm prints from the movie studios is gradually discontinued in favor of digital technology which they can't afford to purchase on their own.I am stepping forward with this fundraiser to help one of these drive-ins to buy a new digital projector, so they can continue to provide the outdoor movie experience for their community. The drive-in which I have chosen to help make the conversion to digital is called the Auto-Vue , a single screen, family owned drive-in theatre located in Sidney, Ohio , which has been in continuous operation each summer since 1956. Without financial assistance, this drive-in will eventually go dark, along with many others, and they lack the resources to make the transition to digital technology on their own.Any funds which exceed the original goal will go toward assisting additional drive-ins to make the conversion to digital.While I will technically be walking 1,034 miles by myself through parts of nine east coast states, I will not be alone in spirit. The ghosts of thousands of closed American drive-in theatres and the memories of the people who miss them will be walking right beside me, along with the hopes of all the other small town drive-ins still struggling to keep their own big screen alive.My goal is to raise enough money to assist at least one small town, mom-and-pop drive-in to remain open, while at the same time raising national awareness about the difficulty which many rural, small town drive-ins are facing to survive in the digital age.

Do you remember when we were kids how big our dreams were? We dreamed of becoming sports players, artists, pyro technicians (at least for me), custom car builders, singers and to be rich and famous! I mean, we really dreamed it up big time and there was no limit to what we could do or be. Somewhere along the way were told to get our heads out of the clouds and dreams get tossed in the trash in an attempt to find a safe path for our lives.Home brewing since 2012, Ricardo was falling into the mindset trap that he didnt have time for hobbies and needed to pursue more relevant things. After all, his past dream projects seemed to be failed attempts and he was often told he was chasing rainbows. In a moment of self-reflection, Ricardo asked an important question, Why not? What advantage is there in living life small to be safe? He decide enough is enough. It was time to quit turning his back on himself, his dreams and Back Unturned Brewing Co. was born.What if we dreamed like kids again? Doing something we are passionate about while making a difference in the world. Why not? This is our only chance at life and this is not a practice game, damn-it!Back Unturned Brewing Co., as we face forward, we brew with Backs Unturned to the dreams in our lives and inspire others to do the same.We are raising $10,000 by September 21, 2016 to kick off the fundraising round.Fundraising Levels$20- Pint glass and tasting$50- Pint glass, tasting and t-shirt*$100- Pint glass, tasting and brewery work shirt*$300- Event tasting (business or personal),10pint glasses, (1) brewery work shirt to ehance the experience of yourevent, increase face time with clients to increase sales and/or have the cool factor at yourholiday party.*included in all packagesVIP Package ($1,000)The basic VIP Membership includes:A.

My name is Jonathan Nwachukwu and I have a dream in my heart that I would like to share with the world.With many of the recent events going on in our country, I realize that we have many complex issues in our inner cities. My experience in East Tennessee has shown me that many of these same problems exist in rural areas. The source of this is usually the same: systemic socioeconomic disenfranchisement. What was supposed to be the next great call for Dr Martin Luther King Jr has taken a turn for worse in a world that is so heavily dominated by big business. One way to combat economic inequality is on a very micro level, firm-by-firm basis. With that said, I present to you: Freedom Business Consultants.Freedom Business Consultants is a project (Soon to be a nonprofit organization) designed to aid small to medium sized businesses. What we do is to provide low cost business consulting services for inner city and rural businesses.The purpose of this organization is to provide solid economic foundation for financially disadvantaged communities. This economic foundation will help to do many of the following things: keep business within communities, increase the tax revenue, reduce local unemployment, improve local services for members of the community, and give each community a greater sense of perceived value. These things can be accomplished by making these types of business more competitive in the general marketplace. Essentially, we want a mom and pop to be able have some type of legitimate competitive advantage versus the big box store.The model we want is to operate with donated funds. Charges to business owners using our services will be based on what they can afford to pay (sliding scale type model). This is to ensure that there is value in the services we provide, as free services can be perceived as having little to no value, and we really want people to take advantage of these services.We need help on two fronts: leadership and donations. This is not a one man dream. I want people that are willing to help make this a reality for our country. Please let me know if you are interested in actively participating in this project.Also, this is intended to be funded primarily through donations be people who feel compelled to do contribute to the greater good of our communities. Donate and spread the word. We can make this catch on like wildfire and help our country by helping next our neighbors.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update""""The Hollywood Workshop""","$1,550","$40,000",Business," September 9, 2016",14,16,HOLLYWOOD,FL,78000,,1,"                            Rose Gargiulo                                                                                                                   HOLLYWOOD, FL                                                        Ive been dreaming about opening a hot spot downtown for learning, art and entertainment.

The things I saw were images no human being should ever have to have imprinted in there brain. As a tornado runs through a community or hits houses my first reaction as most human beings was to stop and help not realizing the mental effects it would have later on. PTSD I was Diagnosed with but before the diagnosis I got into a spot in my life were I didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel and lost everything . With much needed therapy and help I have now bounced back with drive and a new found purpose. I am now creating a new business using all the knowledge I have gained from My past business and with weather to pour into Saving Grave Emergency Shelters . I will be using 98% recyclable material which will bring the cost down on the shelter, especially for the size and makes it affordable to the consumer. My mission is to make sure no Mother, father or child has to deal with fear and terror of not being protected in the event of an emergency and or the possibility of a family being torn apart with losing there loved ones to a tornado .

The name comes from theAfrican proverb: Birds that live will surely grow feathersAGBENOXEVI FARM is a small-scale poultry farm with 3000 chickens in the Sovie Village of the Volta Region in Ghana.Sovie is a small and poor farming village with high youth and adult unemployment rate, high school-dropout rate, high rate of teenage pregnancy and HIV/AIDS, among other social problems associated with poverty. The farm was built 9 years ago by Emmanuel and Agnes; both teachers in the UK until we decided to devote our time and energy into building up the farm 2 years ago.AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL  Between a local community project and a social enterpriseEMPLOYMENT , EDUCATION & NUTRITIONThrough our farm, we are supporting our local community: we employ local people, help them through education, provide affordable nutrition and help teachers and nurses earn extra income by selling our eggs. A MODEL TRAINING FARM where young people are trained in poultry farming and other professional skills: book-keeping, accounting, sales, marketing and management.We are already achieving this - former staff of ours is managing a farm in another city today.We also encourage our main staff, Edem who has been working with us for the longest, to work towards owning his chicken farm. We have given him 300 baby chicks to keep as his own and are supporting him through the gestation period so that when these chicks begin to lay eggs, he can sell them and accumulate the profit as his starting capital. THE FARMNEEDS YOUR HELP TO FEED OUR NEWBABY CHICKS becauseour current stock is aging. Ittakes another three months before the new chicks lay eggs.So we have to raise funds to feed them until this November before we can sell their eggs.WHO ARE WE?1. Edem, a chicken farmer who also knows how to bake bread; he has joined us since 20082. Emmanuel who is an aspiring footballer and a visual artist and he has joined us since he completed his senior high school3. Evelyn who is an aspiring teacher who has just recently completed her senior high school in agricultural studies4. Fifteen year-old Kwesi, our helper who is still in school. We are determined to see him through his education by paying his school fees. In return, he helps around the farm5. Suzzy, a young single mother with 3 children who is also taking care of her youngest sister; she sells our eggs from a rented shop6. Beatrice who is a seamstress and also single; she takes care of her granddaughter and we support her to run a rented street shop in Accra7. Priscilla who used to be our shop-keeper in Kpando town and a single mother at 19 years old; after working with us for 2 years, we have enrolled her in a full-time vocational course on Electronics so that she can continue her education HOW DOES THE FARM HELP THE LOCAL COMMUNITY?The farm has 3,000 chickens; 1,000 are mature layers which give us about 25 crates of eggs daily; that is our only income. The eggs are sold from USD3 to USD4 for 30 eggs per crate. We also sell to people and families with little money, which is another principle we want to keep. Families buy as few as two at a time and at prices as low as USD0.30 for 4 eggs. Therefore, our farm has to run on a very small profit margin to supply such affordable eggs to the local community.Our farm gives opportunities to women, young and old to retail our eggs at affordable prices in towns and villages nearby. They are school teachers, nurses, hospital administrators, school clerks, store owners, market sellers, street vendors and health workers. They buy our eggs to re-sell, or they boil and sell them in streets, bus terminals and markets. Some of them also fry the eggs to sell with cooked instant noodles and bread in street stalls. For each crate of eggs they buy from us, they earn up to US$2- 3 for themselves.WHY ARE WE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP?Whenever it is time for us to buy chicken feed, we are in tight financial corners.Small-scale commercial farms like ours are stuck between the rock and the hard place because we cannot get local stock and imported chickens only function at their optimum with imported feed. So, we are tied into a vicious cycle of perpetual dependence on multinational agri-companies and EU agri-policies. HOW COSTLY IS THE CHICKEN FEED?The baby chicks are eating about 3 bags of feed a day (1 bag = 50kg) and it costs about USD28 per bag. We also have to feed our mature layers; they eat 3 bags a day at the cost of USD 30 per bag. So just the feed alone, it costs us USD174 a day or approx. USD 5,220 a month. Yet our earning from the sale of 25 crates (maximum) of eggs a day, ranges from USD86  107 daily or USD3, 210 per month only, therefore making a shortfall of USD 2,010 every month. And we cannot easily increase the prices of our eggs each time the price of the feed goes up because we need to consider carefully, the affordability of the local community.These are only estimated costs since the amount of feed these chicks eat changes as they grow and the price increases whenever the cedis falls vis-a-vis the USD or British Pounds. WE ARE IN A CRITICAL TIME NOWPlease help see us through the next three months of feeding our chicks before they start laying eggs. ALL YOU NEED TO DO Help cover our shortfall of USD2, 010 per month x 3 months = USD6, 030/= or approx. GBP4,000 between August and November, 2015. That is all we ask for. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Chop Block Cooking & Catering,"$2,620","$10,000",Business," July 8, 2016",35,2,MALIBU,CA,183000,,3,"                            Hap Henry                                                                                                                   MALIBU, CA                                                        Maybe you've already eaten my food, and maybe you're still waiting to try it, but it is my goal to feed as many hungry people as possible and make a difference in our community, and I need your help to make this happen. I have the opportunity to purchase a used food trailer that is licensed to operate in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, but I will need some additional support in order to purchase the necessary appliances, equipment, disposables, and utensils. Commercial-grade products are not cheap!The menu would center around slow-cooked meats-- think pulled pork, braised short ribs, slow roasted chicken, etc. You can order a meat, sauce, and toppings and choose to eat it on a bun, roll, panini, taco, or salad. Maybe I will even add on a meat-free item for all my vegan friends. I would be cooking up good, old fashioned meals with modern twists. I plan on serving hot meals, frozen yogurt, and coffee throughout the day. The primary operating sites would be parks, sports fields, beaches, commercial areas, and private events. My vision is to bring gourmet, fast, casual cuisine to places where you might not ordinarily find these types of good eats at good prices. So what exactly is the purpose of this endeavor that I'm asking you to pitch in for? Well, first I will need to pay my bills and basic living expenses. But beyond that, I plan on establishing a non-profit scholarship fund for sober, recovering men and women to attend four-year colleges and universities, and donating a portion of all profits from food sales towards this cause. My community has helped me in numerous ways through the years and shaped who I am today, and this is one small way that I will be able to give back. So, please consider donating what you are able to towards this cause. There are numerous worthy causes out there, but you can be assured that this is one that will make a direct impact on individual lives. Thank you for your consideration, and if we are able to raise enough funds to launch this food trailer, stay tuned for events such as the grand opening parties! You will all be invited. -Hap Henry+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Sanctuary Brewing Company Fund,"$11,155","$15,000",Business," February 25, 2015",126,19,HENDERSONVILLE,NC,632000,1,14,"                            Lisa Marie McDonald                                                                                                                   HENDERSONVILLE, NC                                                        Sanctuary Brewing is a nano brewery and tap room committed to enriching the lives of humans through our excellent craft beer, and animals by working with advocates to promote by their well-being.

I have shared these photos and videos freely for everyone to enjoy through my Facebook page,Vimeo channel, and the Shetland Aerial Video Project .I've been approached on numerous occasions to provide commissioned photos and videos for individuals, local businesses, film and production companies (including the BBC's ""Springwatch"" programme)and commercial surveys, but to take on aerial work for any financial gainrequires a permission from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In some cases I have been able to ""gift"" individuals an aerial photo of their house if I had been filming in the area, but normally I have to decline any specific commissions.To gain a UK CAA Permission for Aerial Work (PfAW) requires me to provide evidence that I am a competent and safe operator of UAS, have an Operations Manual that covers all aspects of the aerial work I intend to undertake, have a full understanding of air law and how it applies to UAS operations, and have robust safety plans and risk assessment procedures. The simplest route to a PfAW is through a recognised training course, flight test and operations manual assessment.To this end I have decided to take the leap and undertake the Icarusflight training programme with a goal of applying for my PfAW in the first quarter of 2016. I have already invested heavily in equipment and have some financial backing in place for starting the business, but I'm hoping to ""crowd fund"" some of the additional costs involved with training, travel and accommodation costs and insurance to get the business off the ground.This means a lot to me, and as many of you know I have had some serious health issues over the last few years. Running my own aerial media business would allow me to reduce hours in my ""day"" job to do something I have a great passion for, and for however long I'm able to do it!I will be eternally grateful for any financial backing for this project. I'm not sure what I can give you in return, but I could certainly provide you aerial photos or videos of your property or favourite place if it's in Shetland!Thank You!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Vegan Soft Serve for Nashville!,"$2,144","$2,500",Business," March 25, 2015",69,18,NASHVILLE,TN,1400,,5,"                            Karina Khan                                                                                                                   NASHVILLE, TN                                                        Nashville: Would you like to have a vegan icecream parlor where everything is a yes?

I have a love of Saxonburg that developed while attending Knoch Middle School and High School; enough so that I never left! Partnering with me in this venture is a good friend of mine Amie Grinnen. She moved to the area around two years ago and fell in love with what our town has become and wishes to promote our community and see it grow as much as I do. Recently, we started to explore the opportunity to open a new business on Main Street and created this GoFundMe page because we need your help. With the vacancy left by the departure of Randita's Organic Vegan Caf, the town now has a beautiful space for rent. We'd like to use this space to offer something the town once had in the means of a Soda Shoppe.Saxonburg Soda was a thriving business years ago with bottling and all. We'd like to bring back that classic feel of a small town soda shop offering not only the drinks, but ice cream, grilled cheese, and gourmet hot dogs as well!There is a select amount of space available in town for students to hang out after 2pm, so we see this a place where our middle and high school students can go to after the school day is over. Here they can enjoy time with their friends in a safe, welcoming environment. Free Wi-Fi, movie nights, group meetings... these are just a few of the ideas we have brainstormed to date.We believe that this simple idea could draw attention to Saxonburg and benefit everyone in the area. If you have met me before you know that I'm all about working with the local businesses and networking. I am a member of the Saxonburg Area Business Association (SABA) and serve on committees within it, allowing me to voice my thoughts on ways to improve the town and garner support from the local community. We enjoy walking up and down Main Street from place-to-place grabbing lunch or stopping in to talk to friends new and old. We will try to make as many purchases as possible for the Soda Shoppe in collaboration with the wonderful local businesses, be it chili from Batch, cheese from Curds and Molds, or even coffee from Saxonburg Coffee to keep us going on long nights.With your generous contribution, we will look into making all of the purchases necessary without having to worry about taking out a business loan or asking people to invest.Some of the items needed include the ice cream case, a carbonation machine, tables, paint, etc., as well as, making sure we have enough funds left to buy our initial stock. Your donation will not go without recognition, as we believe those who give charitably should be rewarded for their kindness. Our goal is to open the shop in May 2016 when the hopeful warm weather will begin allowing Amie and I ample time to get ready for graduation and the summer festivities in town. If you are able, we'd appreciate the donations sooner rather than later. Do not think you must offer much! If all of us can come together with our friends and donate five dollars... we would meet our goal for fundraising! Just think about that, five dollars and a bit of encouraging words to others, and you can say that you helped support the opening of a wonderful new business!Thank you all for taking your time to read this and considering a donation.No amount is either too big or too small and feel free to share this on your own social media pages to help spread the word. Owning a business has been a dream of ours for the past couple of years and we look forward to making it a reality. We will put our hearts and souls in to continuing to make Saxonburg a great place to live, work, and socialize.

Our menu is a blend of American classic dishes and southern style cooking that is layered with herbs and spices found in many other cultures. The mission of SpoonFed's New York Country is simple, 1) Serve quality and great tasting food, 2) Create a relaxed and friendly atmosphere 3) serve, serve, serve.It's true that a lot of start up companies and restaurants can trace their humble beginnings back to selling meals out of their cars, garages, and small home kitchens. Selling one meal at a time, catering companies and restaurants were established. A somewhat similar story holds true for SpoonfedNYC as well, except it was the brainchild of the backstage hair and makeup team at one of New York City's biggest musicals, Wicked. Working as a dresser on Broadway and TV for nearly 13 years, Randy Witherspoon began cooking and sharing his food and his love for cooking with his co- workers. Part of his nature and charm was seeing others enjoy the foods he had grown up with in South Carolina by recreating his grandmother's recipes. Cooking was a hobby, it was therapeutic, and it was an enjoyable and undeniable passion. On one of these occasions of, ""Look what I cooked today,"" the hair and makeup crew approached Randy and said that they would gladly pay him for his meals, and they were positive that others would, as well; here people were saying out loud, ""Take our money, please!""From that moment on, SpoonfedNYC was in development. Every cast and crew member added comments, ideas, suggestions and most of all, support, to help Randy formulate, create and start his own catering company. From Randy Witherspoon's nickname, Spoon, the name SpoonfedNYC was born, and ""Eat Like You Mean it, Honey!"" quickly became the slogan. That was 2009. The test drives of delivering meals backstage to one show led to taking orders from multiple shows. SpoonfedNYC became a familiar and welcomed name backstage, especially on matinee days. If orders were not placed, meals would still be delivered and left inside the stage door or in the Green Room. People paid using the honor system or with an I.O.U. Not only did this foster a family-like attitude of trust, but it became the cornerstone of the SpoonfedNYC branding. Its that attitude and atmosphere of family, along with our proven menu of favorites -- that Hell's Kitchen will experience with Spoonfed's New York Country restaurant.I am truly humbled by our investors who have already made it possible for me to be this close to doing what I so love to do, cook, share and be of service.We invite you to look at SpoonfedNYC, our catering site, to see that we encourage you to ""Eat Like You Mean It, Honey!""

Each learner requires a personalized approach that focuses on their history with the language, their strengths and weaknesses, and their linguistic goals. Bearing this in mind, students are given the opportunity to be involved in their own education. Offering both private in-home lessons and supplementary group activities, our intuitive and experienced teachers help design a unique curriculum tailored to your needs. Take a language, make it yours.Who We AreDisLangue is the brainchild of Richard Serio and Elizabeth Hepburn, two English teachers and life-long language lovers. Frustrated by classical methods of learning and the high prices of private language schools, we have decided to take language learning into our own hands and open the school we have always wished we could find. Based on the philosophy that language is singularly important for forging important relationships both professionally and personally, DisLangue encourages success for all through the teaching of any in-demand language.Why Paris?At DisLangue, we believe that communication is the key to well-being in all aspects of life and that education allows us to live fully. Bearing this in mind, our priority is to facilitate effective and meaningful dialogue between individuals, cultures, and companies.It is a well known fact that multilingualism is much more commonplace in Europe than in America - countries like Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands boast citizens who speak several languages fluently. France, however, is behind the curve. According to a recent study requested by the European Commission, only 19% of the French population is conversational in more than one language. With markets expanding, international business booming, and tourism spreading, the need for multilingualism in Paris grows every moment. Our goal is to equip our students with the confidence to communicate comfortably in any of the world's major languages.Your DonationAs we build our dream from the ground up, we look to those around us to help make it possible. Your donation, no matter the size, will help us not only establish in Paris, but enrich the lives of our future students. As they gain fluency in their second, third, fourth languages, their worlds will open up in ways they could never have imagined, and ours will do the same. We cannot wait for the day that we see firsthand the betterment of our students' lives through language. By donating, you become an instrumental part of this experience and will join us in helping our students live fluently. The funds we raise during this campaign will go towards securing French work visas for the founders, finding an office space that suits the needs of our students, purchasing teaching supplies, creating a website, and so much more!

We believe that wine and food dont have to be fancy, overwrought, or intimidating. Thats why Lois will serve creative house-made small plates, and all our wine will be on draft (thats right!). Who says wine needs to be from a bottle? Keeping our wines on tap allows us to give customers tastes of the wine before they order, prevent any waste from a corked bottle, and best of all, keep prices low. Our menu will change seasonally, and each dish will be prepared and chosen to pair with each wine.Lois is as much about community as it is about food and wine. We love Alphabet City, our adopted hood, and we wanted to create a place for our neighbors to gather, to eat, and drink. Alphabet City, traditionally part of the Lower East Side and dubbed Loisaida by its residents, retains a strong sense of community. Avenue C continues to be called Loisaida Avenue, and is the inspiration for naming the bar Lois--a nod to the neighborhood we love.WHAT DO WE NEED?Weve got a lot of passion and a tiny space. All of our wine will be served by tap using an under-bar keg system, which will keep wine fresh and prevent oxidation. We know the idea of wine on draft seems unusual, but weve researched (a lot) and consulted industry experts to make sure were building a long-lasting system that will pour the best product and meet market needs. But because wine on draft is still rare, were looking to custom build our tap system and bar. Our pint-sized space means well need to build something that maintains the integrity of the wine, while providing all the form and function of a stellar bar. We need $20,000 to fabricate a beautiful bar that will house our custom tap system and be a focal point reflecting our dedication to wine on draft as a better way to serve and enjoy wine. Were offering some pretty fantastic gift options for every donation level. With each gift, we aim to include you in the experience that Lois offers, a taste of the passion that makes this project special.OUR STORYHey thereNora and Phoebe here. You might know one (or both) of us (lucky you!), but either way were going to tell you our story. We met at a small girls high school in Cleveland Ohio, where we were in different grades, but had similar interests (French, Photography, and laughing out of turn in class). We reconnected during Noras senior year at Georgetown when Phoebe was living in DC and working (miserably) at a desk job that had nothing whatsoever to do with food. Flash forward to New York City and Noras own exodus from a job in PR that had nothing to do with wine when, as luck would have it, Phoebe posted on Facebook about a position for a manager at ABC Wine Co., a small wine shop in the East Village, owned by David Hitchner. Phoebe was managing Davids craft beer bar down the street, ABC Beer Co. (in addition to her position as a cheesemonger at Bedford Cheese Shop) while finishing up her Masters degree in Food Studies from NYU. Nora had already decided she wanted to work in wine and was working as a harvest intern at Brooklyn Winery, but shejumped at the chance to learn about retail at ABC Wine Co., while also pursuing her sommelier degree. And, well, the rest is history.Were beyond excitedto merge our loves of wine and food to create a beautiful space for people to learn and enjoy our favorite things. Lois is located right in between ABC Wine Co. and ABC Beer Co., which allows us to keep serving the neighborhoodand community we love.We are projecting to open our doors around February 15, 2015. Thank you so much in advance for any help or good thoughts you can send our way, and we hope to see you all in February!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Restaurant Indigo,"$2,325","$3,600",Business," August 12, 2016",19,1,HOUSTON,TX,156000,,3,"                            Jonny Rhodes                                                                                                                   HOUSTON, TX                                                                                Hi, my name is Jonathan.My wife Chana and I started doing pop up dinners in my hometown of Houston in November 2015. Using our own money, resources, and home we created 5-course meals at a set price. By using social media we were able to create a following. These dinners were inspired by my up bringing on Jensen Drive, and family heritage in Brenham, Texas.Each dinner has been operated by myself and Chana, whom is the sommelier for our concept.We are looking to raise money for an opportunity few and far between, the opening of our own restaurant. We have found a potiental location, but it will need some help securing the space.Any and all donations will be more than greatly appreciated.

Im Kayla Phillips, a 21-year-old pastry chef with a dream to combine my lovefor quality design, progressive art and delicious dessert!  At an early age, I started cooking out of necessity  necessity quickly turned to joy. Because mobility was an issue for my mother, I took over many responsibilities, but baking was where I was able to seamlesslycombine enjoyment and self-expression. When preparing meals for my family I would be the most ecstatic to create the final dish dessert! As my creations became a family favorite for both their flavor and appearance, I knew that I would always have baking at the forefront of my life.Like most young adults, my vision of the future changed many times and the road to success was more of a winding trail with many roadblocks, speed-bumps and potholes. I ultimately landed at Arizona State University as a Communications major. During my time at the university I dabbled in a variety of different disciplines, but after running through the student loan circus I realizedI wanted topursue an area where I already knew I had a talent, and more importantly, a passion  the culinary arts. Bye-bye ASU! What arose from a rather refreshingpile of ashes was La Soul Desserts. To my surprise, I got a lot of encouragingfeedback after Tempe Farmer's Market's very trusting/crazyowner invited me to sell some of my baked goods at his market. It's safe to say my head doubled in size, because I quit my job and decided to go into business for myselffull time.As I dove deeper into the world of desserts, I saw a lot of things I wasn't cool with. Why were people serving three-day-old pastries? Why were chefs using margarine instead of butter? Why was everything way sweeter than it needed to be? What was with the donuts filled with ice cream and topped with Nutella and sprinkles... and then fried? Were they trying to kill me? It was then that I started to take my business seriously. Not just for me, but because I knew the world needed La Soul. I began to focus on fresh ingredients and where to find them. I researched the harmful effects of refined sugar and committed to using raw sugar in all of my desserts. Everything I made became very small or bite-sized so as to make dessert more enjoyable and less sickly.So, how is La Soul different? On a large scale, we're not! Restaurants with emphasis on not only quality but unique ingredients are peppered throughout metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Portland and New York. But in Phoenix, this idea is all too rare. Of course, we have incredible chefs like The Larder + The Delta's Chef Jones and Chef Silvia of Barrio, who would probably hurt somebody before they served processed meats or frozen vegetables. And while Barrio Gran Reserva serves an out-of-this-world chocolate mousse, and The Larder + The Delta ruined everyones' diets when they installed that milkshake machine, the sweets just aren't the star of the show. Most people answer ""no"" when asked if they have room for dessert. ROOM? In America, the main course gets to take up every corner of our stomach, and that just doesn't seem fair. La Soul is changing the way we Americans see dessert. It's no longer sinful, nor is it the enemy. It's not a pint of ice cream nor two cups of rich ganache oozing out of an already-overly-sweet chocolate cake. We're taking cues from French patisseriesand pushing dessert to be something petite, fresh and aesthetically pleasing.Another element that sets La Soul Desserts apart from most businesses is the person who runs it I'm a 21-year old African-American woman with Native American and Scottish roots as well. I was raised by a single mother and my family, by definition, was always considered ""lower-class."" Although this type of person isn't what is plastered on magazine covers, nor is it the face of most successful people, I represent a large portion of one major group: humanity. My background positions me to understand my surrounding community and all that we face.With your help, I will be able to provide even more moments of sweet happiness.I have already taken the steps to distribute my pastries into local coffee shops and cafes. One of these in particular, Fair Trade Cafe, focuses on using local and organic ingredients, as well as fair-trade certified coffee beans. Their compassionate approach to the cafe concept has made them a renowned staple in the Downtown Phoenix community.We have our eyes set on increasing our presence in the valley and the wider culinary community. How will we do it? This is where you come in! We've identified the 7 elements that we believe will quickly and efficiently allow us to expand.1. Local Farmer's Market Vending Fees-$220 We'd love to have a table at at least two local outdoor markets. To ensure they are able to continue supporting local businesses,these markets require all vendors to pay a small annual fee.2.Business Insurance-$200 Just like your car, your health and your home, a business is liable as well! This will secure a full year of coverage.3. Table Banner-$100 A professionally printed banner goes a long way in attracting customers at a market.4. Packaging/Labeling/Collateral-$300 Packaging and labeling should artfully represent the product inside of it. We'll be using 100% recycled materials for our packaging and business cards.5. Bulk Ingredients (3 month supply)-$550 Buying in bulk will allow us to be much more efficient and cost-effective.6. Community Kitchen Fees (3 months)-$2400 Having a larger space will allow me to make a greater quantity of food, thus expanding La Soul's reach and deepening our community connection! I also need access to a commercial kitchen in order to explore many more recipes, as my current Home Goods & Confectionary License is very restrictive.7. Delivery Vehicle-$3000 I'm currently delivering to all of my coffee shop and cafe locations on foot. This is just simply not sustainable. Having a used but reliable vehicle will allow me toeasilyfulfill my current delivery schedule,as well as expand La Soul's catering opportunities.I would love to meet our goal within two months. With your support, La Soul Desserts can blossom into the renown business its meant to be. Our current supporters believe we already have the creative ideas and business savvy needed to turn La Soul into the sweet spot that Phoenix deserves. All we need now is YOU!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Lotus World Foods& Sarah Nee,"$3,060","$150,000",Business," April 28, 2014",31,29,LA JOLLA,CA,694000,1,15,"                            Sarah Ann Nee                                                                                                                   LA JOLLA, CA                                Lotus World Foods Will Not be Opening at 6905 La Jolla Blvd due to Structural  Violations on the whole building.We are looking for a new location & Need Help to move forward .Our Mission is to provide Organic Plant Based Cuisine & Beverages for Optimum Health.Any Donation is Gratefully Appreciated. .

My passion is to make people happy by giving them a taste of the world! I grew up in an amazing Armenian family with a Nani (that means grandmother) that passed down beloved recipes perfected over centuries. My world travels throughout Europe, Africa and the Pacific inspired me to build on my family tradition by infusing the tried and true with the bold and adventurous. My year in Mozambique cooking for humanitarian aid workers planted a desire to share my love of food, family, and community.I have been hosting exclusive dinner experiences for groups of 6 in my home since the start of September 2015. Its been about one year and I have had three dinners total. I havethe desire to have these exclusive and special dinner experiences more often- once a month. The experience is a place for people to come and enjoy a five course meal. The idea is to show people how valuable they are by presenting an invite-only, high caliber dinner. The money would be used to kickstart the once a month dinner series for the next 12 months. The dinners will have a suggested donation amount to sustain the ongoing series. The plan is to start next month, September, and to go for 12 months. This is the beginning of developing a potential restaurant and would love your help! Everything counts.Thank you so much and look forward to seeing you at the next Talin's Table! www.talinstable.com + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Cancer's Shirt Of Shirts and Book,"$1,005","$1,000",Business," April 24, 2016",14,5,LONG BEACH,CA,89000,,8,"                            Rick Sanchez                                                                                                                   LONG BEACH, CA                                 Cancer's SOS  Telling the Stories of People Affected byCancer  One Shirt At A Time This year, about 569,490 are expected to die of cancer, and 740,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. There is no cure. Several organizations sponsor events throughout the year to raise money for education, screening, and research to combat cancer. More than 6 million people a year agree to raise entry fees between $1900 and $2300 in order to participate in at least one event, and the number is growing. There are more than a dozen major walks and hundreds of smaller walks and 3-5K runs held each year. Participating in theseCancer Walk Fundraisers is one way people cope with their loss. Raising money to pay for the entry fee can be difficult, however, as more people share a decreasing donor pool. Add to that the costs associated with travel and lodging and for some, participating becomes impossible. That's where Cancers SOS comes in!It just takes one day, working at one of these fundraising events to see how important it is to these people to participate. They dress up in costume, put on funny hats, paint their faces, rejoice.Some of them make shirts to wear in honor of someone they lost to cancer. Cancers SOS will help those people!We use those shirts to create something amazing! We tell the stories of the people wearing the shirts, and in the process raise money for cancer walk participants.The centerpiece, the Shirt Of Shirts (SOS) is a t-shirt shaped quilt made from individual, hand-made shirts, literally a Shirt Of Shirts . The first SOS will feature almost 40 shirts and stand 15-feet tall, 12-feet wide. (Subsequent SOS's will feature approximately 150 shirts and stand as high as a 2 story building!)The mosaic of slogans, team names, and pictures of loved ones will create a desire to know more about the teams and individuals featured So we will also publish a photo book of the shirts! Cancers SOS will be the only organization dedicated to fund-raising for people who want to participate in cancer related walks and runs.We tell the stories of people affected by Cancer, one shirt at a time I Didnt Sign Up To Cry!Kellys Angels is a team of co-workers and friends that walk to show support for a dear friend and co-worker Kelly Logan as she battles Cancer. We live all over the country, (Maine, Montana, California, and Louisiana) but work for a company based in Seattle, Washington. Our first walk in 2011 was in Seattle and we had lots of co-worker support. Kelly could not make it since she was right in the middle of treatments and she had some complications with one of her surgeries during our actual walk. Even with the absence of our dear friend it was a very emotional and life changing event. We experienced three days of laughter and tears, even though our motto for the weekend was ""I didnt sign up to cry!"" We had some rain, it was Seattle for goodness sakes, and we have had some camping catastrophes with an early a.m. sprinkler flood of everyone's tents. Kelly's Angels walk with hot pink feather wings on our backs. These wings have been well received by all the walkers and cheering stations (except when we walked through the bird sanctuary in San Diego in 2012 they were confiscated for a short time and returned to us at the next rest stop)Anyway after 3 long days of walking with these wings on our backs we all wondered what to do with them.I, personally, had a Seattle Police Officer that asked every day for the last three days if he could have my wingsI quickly handed them off to him as we cross the finish line, but my three teammates were left with their wings and no good way to get them home since we all have to fly to Seattle to participate.Anyone who has participated in this amazing walk knows that the finish line is a sea of supporters and family members.It is more congested than a rock concert!As our team continued through the sea of people, we came across three of the most beautiful little girls with their Dad. We knew instantly those sweet girls were waiting for their mom.They were the perfect recipients of our angel wings.Our 3 ""Kellys Angels"" ran over to the girls and offered their wingsOf course the girls were thrilled to get them and their Dad was so happy to see the smiles on their little faces.As we stepped back and watched those three little angels, the most touching thing happened.Their mom came across the line with her ""Survivor"" shirt on. These three beautiful little girls Mother was a Breast Cancer Survivor, not just a walker!Our ""We didnt Sign Up To Cry"" motto was instantly out the window.As we stood and bawled the sweet little angels bounced with joy as they showed off their wings to their Mom. It was most amazing thing I've ever experienced and the reason Kelly's Angels will walk again next year.It was the most amazing thing any of us had for participated in before, so in 2012 our team was up for another adventure and we walked in sunny San Diego California. This year we had Kelly to cheer us on along the route and had the outstanding financial support of our co-workers who hosted a Taco Tuesday with all proceeds going to our walk. Having Kelly present was the best part. There was no crying this year - it was a time to celebrate, as Kelly was cancer free. Kelly's Angels' shirt and story and many otherswill be found in the first edition of our book.This has beena long journey for me...well over 5 years, (3 alone just getting all of the shirts and stories compiled.) I would love to complete this on my own but I have simply run out of money and I need your help!Your donation will go towardgraphic design layout forthe book, sewing costs to stitch the shirts together, and publishing costs related to Volume1.We arealready layingout the book and have begun to create the Shirt Of Shirts! We just need the money to finish! We would like to be able to publish the first volume in July so time is tight.Cancer's SOS is in the process of becoming a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization. Our mission is to support people who are affected by cancer, and monies earned through book sales will go toward travel, meal, and hotel costs for cancer walk participants, a mobile cancer screening center, children's cancer research and a separate entity of Cancer's SOS dedicated to enriching the lives of children with cancer.Won't you pleasehelp us Tell the Stories Of People Affected By Cancer, One Shirt At A Time!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help Open our Tattoo shop in LB,$110,"$10,000",Business," August 25, 2016",9,1,LONG BEACH,CA,151000,,3,"                            Summer Rodriguez                                                                                                                   LONG BEACH, CA                                                        My husband Alex's dream has always been to open up his own tattoo shop.

He got into art in his teens and started with graffiti and drawing which then lead him into painting murals and learning how to tattoo. He loves and appreciates all art so along with tattooing he is also a sign maker full time. He loves kids and enjoys making props for their birthdays or any special occasion. Right now he is only tattooing part time and would love to be able to quit his sign making job and move onto his career in tattooing. We live in Long Beach, Ca and we love this city. One thing we have noticed and after talking to many people in our area is that there are no tattoo shops near us. We would love to bring the vintage traditional vibe of an old school tattoos shop to Long Beach. I never thought I would reach out to our community to try and help us with this dream of ours, but we would love to have the community involved and hear any suggestions from you as well.I would love to make this dream come true for my husband and I stand by 100%!Thank you so much in advance for donating, sharing this or even just reading this.Alex & Summer Rodriguez                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help a local mom beat cancer,"$1,077",$1.0M ,Business," April 15, 2015",36,17,STATEN ISLAND,NY,4000,,,"                            Richard Levoi                                                                                                                   STATEN ISLAND, NY                                                        Information about the advertising your business will receiveMy name is Richie Levoi I am New York singer/songwriter/piano player with a music style similar to Billy Joel.

I have so far created a blog ( https://medium.com/@matthewdavisjr)and shared my work through social media, as well as joining volunteer organizations that will bolster my professional and public appeal, resulting in an expansionof my audience.On my birthday, June 12th, 2016, I packed up and followed my dreams and goals to Las Vegas, Nevada. I chose Las Vegasfor two very distinct reasons. First, I was offered an intern/consultation position with a Non-Profit group, No Room Fear Ministries. Secondly, I felt the politics and conversation about politics in Nevada would provide a great opportunity for my voice to be heard.I created this gofundmeaccount to ask family, friends, neighbors, and those who feel moved to help me as I travel around the west coast (and other select places, notably Philidelphia and Ohio for the Conventions in late July) following both Presidential Campaigns and related news topics. The money will be used in conjunctionwith compensation from my job to move into an apartment (currently staying with a team), fund my travels and entrance into political events (I currently don't have media credentials), and finally, aid in creating a viable website and publication (not just another blog site, but a site built to excellence by paid professionals).I can't begin to describe the overwhelming gratitude I currently feel for everyone who has helped me get this far. I know that feeling will only multiply with each donation I receive. I wish I had the perfect words to express how thankful I am in advance, but I do not. Instead, I'll just say God Bless you and thank you for helping me achieve my dreams. I will not and cannot forget those who help me get this far and those who will help me go even further.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Outbreak Simulation Panel at AMKE,$415,$400,Business," January 30, 2016",9,7,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,53000,,8,"                            Sammy Saykao                                                                                                                   MINNEAPOLIS, MN                                Introduction:This is an outbreak simulation of my own design. It is an interactive, turn-based simulation game meant to introduce people into the world of public health and the impressive work that epidemiologists and their colleagues do. This gofundme will help me with some of the funds required to debut this simulation at Anime Milwaukee. I have been accepted as a panelist and would love to be able to see how my outbreak simulation is received. I will post updates on this gofundme and on my blogevery week until March 21st, so please keep posted and share this with friends, family, and anyone else who is interested. Thank you so much and keep reading for details!Funding BreakdownGoal Amount - $400*Accomodations and Travel - $510Food - $200Simulation (Printing, packaging, prepping) - $50*Any additional money will go towards paying the rest of the accommodations and travel****But I love giving you all rewards and stuff, so check out the stretch goals below!Stretch GoalsWe've reached our goal! These are stretch goals that will be done if we reach them. All rewards from Witness to Epidemiologist will benefit from these stretch goals!$550  Make 1 additional case$650  Make 2 additional cases$750  Add worn details to case files for additional realismAbout the Simulation:In this simulation, people are separated into five teams (cities) and provided case files of residents who have been recently infected with this mysterious disease. Every turn, teams are allowed to do two actions out of the six actions available. Depending on their actions, their citys prevalence (total number of people infected) and prevention rates will change, and they may even be able to obtain additional information. Teams will need to pay attention to the events occurring in their cities as events can increase prevalence rates. Due to time constraints for the panel, each turn is limited to about 20 minutes, so teams must work quickly to make final decisions.Outbreak simulation outlineActionsFuture DevelopmentThe purpose of this current simulation project is to observe how well it is received for intended audiences. Due to the nature of this particular outbreak, the target audience is 18+. However, in the future, I would like this simulation to be applied to a classroom setting as an introductory activity to engage students in public health. Additional scenarios would be developed around historical or fictional events that would make students consider disease patterns in all societies, which could then be lead into further conversation about the goals of public health. All materials regarding these outbreak simulations would be free for teachers and educations to use and download and could be used to supplement other free educational materials, such as the ones provided by the CDC.Additionally, if time and money allows, I would like to further the aspects of this particular project by incorporating mixed media into the case files and scientific discoveries. As the story continues to develop and grow, I would like this to be sold as a mixed media mystery novel for young adults and aspiring scientists. Newspaper clippings, cassette tapes, CDs, and other media will be added to allow readers to immerse themselves in the mystery and follow the narrative of the characters who are facing a world with a terrifying new disease.About MeMy name is Sammy, and my ultimate dream is to make public health the most fun thing ever. Im talking books, dramas, sitcoms, mockumentaries, videogames and anything else you can think of! I graduated with a BA in Medical Microbiology and Immunology with a minor in Environmental Studies in 2015. I am currently working on my Masters of Public Health with a focus in Epidemiology. I have experience in public health after interning in the Wisconsin Department of Health and Human Services in their Tuberculosis program, and I am currently working at the Minnesota Department of Health in the Foodborne, Waterborne, Vectorborne, and Zoonotic Diseases section as a student worker. I also have some experience teaching and creating teaching materials while working as a software trainer for Software Training for Students from 2012-2015.With student loans and living on my own, I would really appreciate the help towards presenting my simulation at Anime Milwaukee. I live on a very tight budget, but this was my chance to really try something I have been wanting to pursue for a long time. Ive managed to save some money for Anime Milwaukee, which is reflected in how the goal is less than the cost of the entire trip. However, additional donations will allow me to focus more on the simulation instead of my finances.

About a week later I saw his work via social media and immediatly reached out to him. We talked for a couple days and we both came to a partnership that we were gonna create a clothing company dedicated to a broad audience in the street fashion industry. We both agreed to stay true to ourselves and to split even 50/50. He would run the designing and art while I would run the business end. To sum up my conclusion in explaining this story, me and my business partner are creating what we think could be a million dollar clothing line.The start of our success lies on the foundation of funds we have, and right now the little funds we have are being put to creating our logo via Professional editing. The money will be used to fund a trademark and create a domain name also creating our actual first Unique T-Shirt.We are hoping to raise the funds by the end of September so we can climb the first step of success.This means so much to me because for a very long time ive been planning to create a clothing line so unique from the others, ive spent countless hours and nights studying and focusing on what will make our brand a ""Gotta Have it"" Brand. I come to realize not only will I serve my country active in the military but I have a special calling to be a entrepeneur.

I've always been one to put my art on anything but paper, from my arm to a wall to the covers of school books. I've never been satisfied with putting my ideas on simple canvases. Now, I plan to put my art on clothing. As a teen entrepreneur, I am spreading my creative wings and soaring into the world of wearable art with my own clothing line, Itll Be Fun!  Your support will help enable me to meet the start-up expenses of creating my brand and designing, manufacturing, and launching my first collection in early 2017. My products will be 100% made in the USA, with 10% of all proceeds donated to initiatives that assist teens in overcoming eating disorders. It would mean the world to me if you could help me reach my fundraising goal and contribute to promoting awareness of my art-for-a-cause. No amount is too small, and all supporters at the $20 level or higher will receive a free limited-edition It'll Be Fun signature T-shirt before it goes on sale to the public.

It is a chronic illness and it's for life. There are about 150 million people around the globe suffering from this condition but so few know about it! It is not a life theatening disease which is why Lymphies (lymphedema sufferers) don't get enough attention and not much is being done to help us live adequately in our day to day lives.THE WHY?Lymphies have to wear medical compression stockings as part of their daily treatments in order to keep control of their condition, but all the garmentsare very expensive, very uncomfortable (as they are clearly not made by people who wear them) and just plain old ugly... Wearing these garments really can chip away at your self esteem and so many suffer from depression because of this issue and so stop wearing their garments which utlimately makes their condition much worse (speaking form personal experience).What I want to do is help give people back their confidence in their physical appearance. As for manypeople like me, we have to wear these awful garments day in/ day out at home, at work, at the gym, at the beach, with our pretty short dresses, under our skinny jeans, with shorts, whether it be hot or cold we have to wear them EVERY. DAMN. DAY. ( see horrifying pic above).THE WHAT?I want tostart a business making printed medical stockings but firstly I need to raise enough money to create a prototype, and this is what I need:1 ->Buy the stockings2 ->get them printed3 ->then send them to get tested to check whether they are safe or not for people to wear.When I started researching this project, I kept getting talked out of it, as everyone said it was too ambitious and would be too expensive to set up, and they were right...Until someone suggested I crowdfund the project, which I absolutely love the idea of!! Why not get my fellow lymphies and other people who care about us involved! As the more of us are on board, the more ideas we can share!So here goes, I need 1187 to:->pay for stockings & postage->to print the garments & postage->to have them tested at a lab (which is the most expensive part)And if we get through these three stages & the product is deemed safe, then we can start the crowdfund to start up the business and improve so many people's lives!! Woohoo!!So please whether you are a lymphie or not, if you would like to help a lymphie and many more, (as medical stockings are not only worn by people who suffer from lyphedema but many other painful conditions), then please give me a hand. I'll take anything even a supportive message so that I don't give up again :)Photo credit: Left: Jemma Right: kellyatlarge (etsy)                    + Read More"Fountain City Creamery Park Grille,"$14,339","$100,000",Business," February 10, 2016",170,7,KNOXVILLE,TN,2900,7,1,"                            Robert McDonald III                                                                                        on behalf of Jeff PatinKNOXVILLE, TN                                                        Twenty-two years ago in a small park side building in the heart of Fountain City, Jeff Patin opened a little dream called The Creamery. It started as a small ice cream shop where his three boys, Matt, Adam and Ben could come and work and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way. Salads and sandwiches soon followed and before we all knew a restaurant was emerging. The Creamery Park Grille, as it would later be named, became a staple in Fountain City. Opening up the second floor to allow for more seating and allowing for larger parties and events to be held in this family owned business. Kids from Gresham Middle School would swarm the counter top looking for bags of fries and ice cream in every shape and form they could get. And Jeff was always there with a smile, laugh, strong handshake and a hug. For many kids this became their first job, whether it was scooping up ice cream or taking orders for a Seven Layer Salad, or in the back kitchen grilling up burgers and chicken. What a lot of people didn't know is that the Creamery is so much more than a restaurant.For those of us that have worked at the Creamery it quickly became apparent that we were becoming part of a larger family. Jeff was, and still is to many, like a second father. He liked to boast about all his beautiful daughters and would be just as protective of any one of them as if they were his own. The boys in the back are a rambunctious rowdy group that are fiercely loyal to each other and The Creamery as a whole. We are The Creamery Family and The Creamery is our home.My wife and I met working at The Creamery, she was the beautiful waitress that brought ""service with a smile"" a whole new meaning, and I was the bandana wearing cook that could grill a mean burger but couldn't look her in the eye for trying. Two years later Jeff hosted our rehearsal dinner in the upstairs dinning room. Why would we want to have it anywhere else? I left The Creamery but was never too far; always there to help out for an event or cleaning equipment during a remodel, it was home after all. When my two children were born the first place we took them was of course The Creamery. When Jeff asked if I could come back part time and help out, as all three of his sons had all moved on, I rushed right over. It was like riding a bike. Whoever said, ""you can never go home again"" never worked at The Creamery.This morning all of us woke to a nightmare. As we slept our home had burned down. True, we are all extremely thankful that no one was hurt. To lose one of our own would have been too much for us to bear. But to drive down that familiar stretch of Hotel Road and instead of seeing the bright red roof we loved we saw a collapsed burnt husk. The anger, the shock, the wave of helplessness that washed over all of us was as severe and personal as if our own houses had burned down. But none of that came close to the loss we knew that Jeff was feeling, as he watched his dream come to a horrible end.So, we need your help. This is a small family owned business, not a big corporation or franchise, but one man, one family's whole world. The building we were in was over a hundred years old, it isn't going to be brought back up quickly, easily, or cheaply. Jeff would never ask for help, but myself, and the rest of his Creamery family are. Jeff has given so much to us that we want to give something back to him, and with your help we just might be able to do something amazing. To watch a dream burn down and then to maybe see that spark of hope build the dream back up, well thats nothing short of what this wonderful man deserves. All of us at The Creamery thank you, Fountain City is a small community but its a strong one and one that we know can help rebuild one man's dream.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Purple Heart Recipients Dream,"$87,246","$300,000",Business," January 31, 2016","1,886",7,UNIVERSAL CITY,TX,22000,41,10,"                            Bobby Henline                                                                                                                   UNIVERSAL CITY, TX                                I have a dream, my dream is to continue to overcome the obstacles in life, live joyously with the hand I have been dealt and to demonstrate to others, all that can be done and accomplished, no matter what.My mission is to keep showing up and paying it forward. A part of my dream is to own a quick service restaurant. WHY? Because I want to create a stable income, hire Veterans and then pay it forward by helping other Veterans own their own quick service restaurant. I have partnered with a Veteran that owns Biggies Burgers and Great Shakes in San Clemente, California and he is working with me to establish a Biggie's Burgers and Great Shakes in San Antonio under his program Sunrise Warriors. Learn more at SunriseWarriors.comWith the money raised, I will be able to secure an existing building, attain necessary equipment, get my training andget the restaurant up and running. Any money left over will be put in a fund toward supporting another veteran in getting their own restaurant up and running.My goal is to have the funds raised by May 2016. I have already found my desired location in San Antonio.By accomplishing this, I can set the expample to other Veterans dealing with PTSD or other ailments, amputees and burn victims, that you can overcome, persevere and prevail. In the military, it is always Lead by Example, so I am stepping up to be the example so others can follow and believe it can be done.A big part of who I am is about giving back. I live to support others, now I am asking for support in my dream. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for believing in me and helping me attain my dream and lead the pathway for others.Please learn more about me and my journey through these links. Thank you!

I am always conscious of my diet, and I spend long hours in the gym, as well as keep up with my online social media presence. Those, however, are just the basics on top of my regular day job. There is much, much more that goes into building a successful modeling career, just as there is much, much more that goes into building any successful brand. That is what I am really doing: I am building a brand.I am getting all of the right kind of attention, and I have grown my fan base to encompass more than 2 million users on Facebook alone. The offers that I am getting for photo-shoots, castings, and key social events are what I have always dreamed of, and I am still worrying about covering basic expenses like clothing, travel, and lodging. It would mean the world to me to be able to focus on my modeling career exclusively. I know that I am almost at a point where I could support myself and once I am there, I intend on using my profile and my position for the good of society. I just need to get there first.Thats where you come in, GoFundMe. I am turning to you for help raising $(amount) to give me a boost into the future enabling me to say yes to many opportunities about which I have thus far been ambivalent. The money that you contribute will set me on a pathway to a brighter future, and for that I will be forever grateful. I thank you for your time.A little about me:I've had a job since I was 12 years old. I donate to random charities, and have done so since I started modeling. I take care of the people that I love, and I have a big heart. I'm not afraid to put myself out there. You can judge me by what you read on other sites that like to bully, or you can visit my social media pages and see the kind of person I really am.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"HOLEY TOLEDOUGH STOREFRONT,"$7,510","$20,000",Business," May 1, 2016",153,4,TOLEDO,OH,2300,2,2,"                            Chris Ritter                                                                                                                   TOLEDO, OH                                The time has come!We have found a future home to be the retail storefront of HOLEY TOLEDOUGH!...BUT we need your help!We are a 1 year old startup company serving from-scratch delicious and creative doughnuts all around Toledo, ohio.The retail space is 1700 sqf and will be a game changer for us.Just imagine- Fresh doughnuts being rolled, fried, dipped and filled before your eyes in our open setting kitchen, Instead of all production being 3rd shift and the doughnuts sold throughout the day(how it is now),this will allow us to be continuously making fresh doughnuts ALL DAY LONG!

Rocks were being thrown and breaking her windows, more than once a month in the last seven months. Most recently was just yesterday (June 27, 2016)!She has false cameras set up around the building and signs to deter such actions but to no avail. She has spoken to security camera companies but they were priced around $3000 to $4000 and as a small business, that is a very costly investment. She has reached out to her insurance company afterthe first few incidents but they have threatened to drop her due to the frequency of her claims.There have been no other reports or incidences regarding vandalism in the area and the Eugene Police do not have a solution except to take a report and try to increase police presence. During our discussion, we both feel this could be a hate crime towards her and her establishment. She is in fear for her business, livelihood and potentially her physical being because she does not know who is doing this or why they are doing it, as theseare unprovoked attacks.The money raised will be used for installing a new security system with cameras and WiFi and to repair the damages to her property.Phung has been a community member for many years and her business has never experienced anything like this.As many of you know, she lost her husband two years ago and running this business without him has been stressful and at times very challenging.

Very soon, 35mm movie prints will no longer be available and our local drive In theater will be forced to close.   We are talking about The Holiday Drive IN Theater in Mitchell, Indiana, the Hometown of NASA Astronaut Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom. The Holiday is one of those theaters that does not have enough business to be able to make the year round, $1800.00 per month, digital projector payments to keep the Drive IN Open.The Holiday Drive IN Theater, as it sits today would cost about $900,000.00 to build from scratch. The theater barely makes enough money to keep the doors open on the small $80,000.00 dollars currently invested with zero money to make payments on a brand new digital projector.  Steve Wilson, the owner of the Holiday has been very lucky so far to be able the keep the doors open as 35mm continues to get more scarce with each passing month. Steve feels 2015, more than likely will be the final year in which he can get by on 35mm prints, with many titles no longer available on film which is already compounding the financial issue. We have started this Go fund Me page, to bring awareness to the high possibility of losing this theater. To give our many friends and many loyal customers a chance to help save this Historic Landmark of a theater, $22, $55 or $110 or more at a time.Our goal is to be able to purchase a brand new $85,000.00 projector and to build a very small year round heated and air-conditioned room to place the projector in. Our back up plan is to come up with at least $30,000.00, to purchase an older outdated projector as a last resort, which works, but older technology will have half the life of a new unit.Please pitch in and help us save this old theater!   Just this past year, we had a billion dollar company want to purchase this theater, to tear it down to re-purpose the land! Steve Wilson has told these kinds of people, time after time, The Holiday Drive-IN Theater is Not FOR SALE! We need your financial help to save this Old Theater!

Upon opening the door to his home and comics shop, he discovered flames tearing through the building. He was able to get himself out safely, but the building in which he lives and does business is ruined.  He is unable to open his store, which is his sole source of income. In his own words, ""I can't believe that my worst nightmare has happened.""Kenny has poured his heart and soul into his shop, growing it by himself from the ground up over the past 11 years, as well as cultivating a network of friends and customers who share his passion for comics and gaming.  Small businesses are financially vulnerable to disasters like this, and Big Brother Comics cannot survive without being able to reopen as soon as possible. In the coming weeks to months, Kenny will need to move and try to re-establish his business. In the meantime, he has no source of income to support himself or his shop. Please consider donating whatever you can to help him through this terrible time.  Please also be on the lookout for updates on some deeply discounted merchandise that survived the water and smoke damage. I, Kenny's sister, am reaching out to you because Kenny is against asking for financial help from anyone, ever. He's always the one to help out anyone in need.
