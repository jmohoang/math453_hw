We currently have no funding, and our funds have all been depleted. We have spent over 250k of our very own personal money to build renovate and operate this facility for out youth.  We have been taken to court today and have received 15 days before the eviction process is started.  Were raising money to keep our doors open so that we can continue to save life and help our youth achieve their dreams. The secret to help this generation is love, concern, resources and a haven.Our center is modern and cool, filled with new technologies that is catered to the millennial teen and were serving youth with more than just a snack and something constructive to do. Were giving them a chance to make profound changes in their lives despite major obstacles: peer pressures, gang involvement, poverty, addiction, dysfunctional families and more www.hollywoodreamers.com In 2015 HollywooDreamers has fulfilled its vision of leasing and renovating a facility in the Bronzeville community located in Chicago, IL. This facility has become the permanent home for the foundation. Its location serves an area critically needing our services because of a lack of after-school programs in the area. The neighborhood has been revitalized and redeveloped, and we are committed to continuing this by doing our part through our community and after-school/summer programs. HWDF emphasizes security and harmony in the neighborhood by building communication between residents and our foundation. This project relates to our mission by upgrading to a facility reflective of the recent neighborhood changes and providing a safe, modern environment for our youth, staff and volunteers, and continuing as a focal point for community activities. Those who will benefit most are the high at-risk youth that other agencies turn away and the residents who are supported by our community improvement programs. The project renovation totaled in the amount of $125,000. Developing a modern state of the art facility which includes a full computer lab of over 20 Computer systems which is loaded with instructional based programs including interactive Life Skills, Spanish, typing, ACT/SAT, GED and many other academic software. It offers a Juice bar for healthy snacks and smoothies, Caf for relaxation, 8 televisions, Gaming systems, Board games, classroom and even a basketball rim. HollywooDreamers Foundation (HWDF) is focused on the most underprivileged youth residing in Chicagos most violent neighborhoods, surviving on limited resources and constantly seeking out a purpose for their life. HWDF currently works with youth who never have been nurtured and reared in a way to develop into a productive generation. Our mission is to inspire Dreamers to Achieve the unthinkable. We strive to provide youth with moral values, strong character, and mental clarity; exposing them to an environment with various resources that will help master independent life skills and maximize their full potential. Our vision is to equip Dreamers through customized programs that will enable them to reach their full potential as productive citizens.Our Foundation Goals- Create safe after-school and summer environments for at-risk youth- Provide structured activities fostering a positive group experience-Educate at-risk youth in life skills training, including education and job seeking skills to prepare them for adulthood- Provide tutoring to improve academic performance and school attendance-Avoid negative police contact by youth and no involvement in correction system-Provide mentoring for adult guidance and support-Teach entrepreneurship in order to inspire and produce small business ownersIn 2010, I was inspired by my experiences as sports performance trainer to professional athletes and in various organizations to create programs that would later become the foundation of HWDF. As a sports performance trainer, youth services activist and community leader, I was afforded the opportunity in 2009, through a community organization, to develop, implement and oversee a summer program where my previous ideas could be put to use. Through the enlisting of my close childhood friend, Ms. Beyonca Johnson, who would be asked to serve as a founder of HWDF, these ideas would later transform into the base and foundation of the HollywooDreamers Foundation/The Bronzeville Dream Center.We stand by our unique programmatic structure, which includes progressive merging in the skills of social, educational, sports and strengths-based components as a catalyst for healthy youth development and family involvement. With much dedication and perseverance, the vision of HWDF has grown to become an intricate part of the lives of our students, parents, staff members and various community partners.We intend to instill a confidence in the minds of youth that transcends their gift and art form into vehicles that promote forward thinking, movement and balance in their overall lives. We accuse our youth of being at their best and to continue a spirit of learning while performing at a level of excellence. We are a voice for social and system focus to keep the health & wellness and creative arts as a major component in the developmental and educational curriculums in both private and public schools.There are many obstacles that any founder has to meet when launching a new project, and the vision cannot move forward without support from a host of individuals, evidenced through teamwork. We are thankful for that.For almost seven years, HWDF has exposed youth to sports performance, creative arts, leadership, education and family empowerment.OUR HISTORYThe HollywooDreamers Foundation (HWDF) is a private, non-profit youth agency established in 2010 by its Founder and Executive Director Holly Medley. Our vision is to Equip Dreamers through customized programs that will enable them to reach their full potential. HWDF targets inner city at-risk youth ages 13-24 coming mostly from single parentage, low-income, and often volatile environments. These young people are often turned away by other inner city youth serving agencies.During the early years, under Hollys direction, neighborhood youth were persuaded to become responsible and accountable by teaching these and other values through team sports such as basketball. As a condition of playing, youth were required to remain in school and achieve passing grades. Volunteers assisted these efforts by mentoring youth, acting as role models and becoming their extended family at times. Basketball became a physical outlet for these youth, and our first after-school program that became the cornerstone for what we are today. Several hundred youth gained self-confidence, self-respect and developed into responsible adults by applying themselves with their learned values and positive choices from this experience.HollywooDreamers Foundation addresses the community crises of family disintegration, academic failure, violence, unemployment, and gang involvement. The foundation has served over 1,000 youth last year across the city of Chicago. All HollywooDreamers services are grounded in a Positive Youth Development Model, enabling youth to become more confident in their abilities, more resilient to adversity, and better prepared for the transition to adulthood.Our work is committed to addressing the growing need to promote the physical, mental, spiritual, and academic well-being of African American and Latino males within the community; many of whom face disproportionate risks and challenges. Our philosophy is Dream, Believe, Work, and Achieve. The HWDF works collaboratively with students and the community to build confidence in the intelligence, athletic abilities, and personal development of young men in the attainment of their dreams. In 2015 we opened the doors of a newly constructed facility that is now known as the ""Bronzeville Dream Center"" which is a place of retreat for under privileged youth in the city of Chicago. With the rise of violent crime in the city, the Dream Center serves as an alternative for those who are at risk of being incarcerated or becoming homeless.At HWDF, we consider ourselves a strong and resilient community network that will not stand by and watch our kids fall prey to a vicious cycle. Were in the business of disrupting that cycle and helping our young people create the foundation for a bright and rewarding future. Thats our calling as an organization. Thats the reason we do what we doWe have become a leader in serving at-risk youth through our ability to connect with these youths when others could not, which is our passion and strength.WHO WE SERVE:80% African American20% Latino90% Males10% FemalesOUR PROGRAMSHEALTH & FITNESS / ENRICHMENT/ ACADEMICSAt the HollywooDreamers Foundation, our programs are targeted to reach young people considered most vulnerable and at-risk.

The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Education (DOE) have abruptly enacted a new policy, defining the category of sex in Title IX to include gender identity. This effectively renders Title IX meaningless, as females can no longer be recognized as distinct from males. Indeed, Title IX, the legislation used to champion the very creation of female sports, is now being used to dismantle them, as male athletes demand access to female teams, dominating the competition. The reinterpretation of sex to include gender identity also means that girls bathrooms and locker rooms must be opened up to any male who identifies as female. Girls rights to personal privacy and freedom from male sexual harassment, forced exposure to male nudity, and voyeurism have been eliminated with the stroke of a pen. Schools that do not comply with the demands of any male student to access protected female spaces will now lose federal funding.Womens Liberation Front (WoLF) has decided this cannot stand. The President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, has told teenage girls that they are now required to get over their discomfort at boys in their locker room. We need your help to fund our legal battle against the U.S. government.

Suicidal people have changed their minds and reached out after seeing the show.We want young people in high school and college who can't afford to the $30 to $100 to have access to the show and its message, which is ""You're not alone. If you're struggling, Tell Someone.""The Marsh is a registered 501(C)(3) nonprofit and all donations are 100% tax deductible.About ""The Waiting Period""This show is an unrelenting look at a ten-day period in Copelands lifethe mandatory ten-day waiting period before he could lay his hands on the newly purchased gun with which he planned to take his own life. Even in the midst of this tragedy, however, his wonderful sense of the comedy of life does not desert him (how much should he spend on the gun?), indeed serves him insidiously well as a buffer against the grim reality of his intention. Copeland hopes this very personal, and ultimately redemptive, story will reach people who struggle with depressionoften called the last stigmatized diseaseas well as their families and loved ones. Interspersed with interviews with other sufferers, the play also offers outsiders an insiders view, thereby expanding our understanding and, hopefully, our humanity. As critic Sam Hurwitt put it in The Idiolect: Its a play Id strongly recommend to anyone who is now or has ever been depressed or who knows someone in that situation. But honestly, its such a strong piece that Id recommend it just as heartily to anyone whos ever been human.About Brian CopelandBrian Copeland has been in show business since he first stepped on the comedy stage at the tender age of 18. Soon he was headlining clubs and concerts across the country and opening for such artists as Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, Ringo Starr, and the Queen of soul Aretha Franklin, in venues from The Universal Amphitheater to Constitution Hall in Washington DC. Soon, Copeland branched off into television, appearing on comedy programs on NBC, A&E and MTV. He spent five years as co-host of San Francisco FOX affiliate KTVU breakfast program ""Mornings on 2"" and two years hosting San Francisco ABC affiliate KGOs Emmy Award winning afternoon talker ""7Live.""In 1995, ABC affiliate KGO Radio premiered The Brian Copeland Show. Its unique mix of talk and entertainment soon made it the most listened to program in its time slot. Copeland branched out into theater in 2004 with his first solo play, ""Not A Genuine Black Man."" This critically acclaimed exploration of race and identity created an audience pleasing blend of laughter, tears and sociology that led to the show becoming the longest running solo play in San Francisco theatrical history. Successful runs in Los Angeles and Off Broadway and a bestselling book adaptation followed. ""Genuine"" has been performed in over 30 cities across America.PressTaking aim at depression with Waiting Period crowdfunding - SFGate.comAlameda: Copeland's acclaimed 'Waiting Period' comes to Altarena - InsideBayArea.com Combating Depression with a Year of Free Theater - KQED ArtsAfter Robin Williamss Suicide, Brian Copeland Revives His Show About Depression - Newsweek Magazine Robert Hurwitt's San Francisco Chronicle review of ""The Waiting Period"" Sam Hurwitt's The Idiolect review of ""The Waiting Period"" Chad Jones' TheaterDogs review of ""The Waiting Period""+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Love WINs!- Help us Rebuild,"$15,528","$50,000",Charity," January 15, 2016",462,8,CHARLESTOWN,IN,2400,10,1,"                            Tim Stark                                                                                        on behalf of Melisa StarkCHARLESTOWN, IN                                                                                Wildlife in Need is a 501c3 non-profit located in Charlestown IN dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and release of indigenous wildlife and a safe harbor to an array of exotic and endangered species.

While you may believe that this will be a home game for the United States the truth is that couldn't be any further from the truth. Previous games between the United States and Mexico played in Southern California have been hostile environments for our American team, with Mexico fans coming out to dominate the stadium. In 2011 in a Gold Cup final that took place at the Rose Bowl Mexican fans easily outnumbered American fans 20 to 1.At the same time many of us are strong supporters of our troops in our active military and veterans. We want to thank them for their service in anyway we can. So how do we kill two birds with one stone? We bring our active military and veterans to the game. By partnering with the Veteran Tickets Foundation we'll be able to purchase tickets to the game for active military members, veterans and families of our military who were killed in action.While this campaign may be getting a lot of support from the American Outlaws this is campaign is about the American People showing their love for our military members. Donations are welcome from any individual or group who would like to participate.Why should I donate?Well if supporting your military soldiers and veterans isn't enough, the folks atWorldSoccerShophave agreed to give a free American Outlaws shirt to anyone who donates $100 or more.How can you help?First of all, if you can get yourself to the game to support our country do so. If you can't or want to do more donate to this fundraiser to buy tickets for United States Military Veterans to the game. All proceeds from this fundraiser will be donated to the Veteran Tickets Foundation(a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization) to purchase and distribute tickets to veterans.Who are the Veteran Tickets Foundation?Veteran Tickets Foundation (Vet Tix) provides FREE event tickets to family members of troops Killed In Action (K.I.A.), our Military and Veterans to sporting events, concerts, performing arts and family activities.Attending these events reduces stress through entertainment, strengthens family bonds, builds life long memories and encourages service members to stay engaged with American life and local communities.Why a $38,044 goal?Originally, we had a goal of $5,000 goal based on the estimate that tickets will run around $50 each after taxes and TicketMaster charges and $5,000 would bring 100 extra people to the game to support our team in their match against Mexico.Then we had a goal of $15,000 based on buying 10 rows of 25 seats at $60 per seat.Now, we've been told the tickets are probably going to be even higher than $60. So we're going to use a $70 ticket price and shoot for 500 tickets. In order to buy 500 tickets after fees and GoFundMe charges at $70 each we'll need a grand total of $38,044. So that's our new goal.What about the military members who support Mexico?While one of the goals of this fundraiser is to bring US supporters to the game, the real goal is to show thanks to the members of our military. It's going to be that some of them are going to support Mexico and if that's their choice we're still going to welcome them with open arms.Who are we?We're a group of American Outlaw memberswho want to make the game against Mexico in Pasadena just feel a bit more like a home game for our team.Spread The WordLet's make sure everyone knows about this campaign.

Thank you all for your support!______________________________FAMILY FIGHTS BACK AGAINST OIL PIPELINE WITH ISSUES OF EMINENT DOMAIN AND CLIMATE CHANGEHi,My wife and I have been sued by the Enbridge Pipeline company. We have farmland in North Dakota that has been in my family for decades. Enbridge Pipeline (the largest oil pipeline company in the world, based in Canada) wants to build a 24 pipeline to carry oil from the fracking oil bonanza of the Baaken oilfields of western North Dakota to the port city of Superior, Wisconsin where it can then be shipped and sold around the world.Of the 800 property owners in North Dakota along the proposed route of the Sandpiper Pipeline, Im sorry to say we are the only ones saying NO to their offer of money and requesting a jury trial. I have written a seven page essay that describes who we are and why we are taking a stand. It is available HERE.Enbridge sued us. We are the defendants. Our opposition is based on our sense of ethical responsibility in fighting against climate change factors, and our belief that their taking of our land is an abusive overreach of the power of Eminent Domain. I have written two topical poems on those issues that are available HERE.As the only landowners in North Dakota taking a principled stand against this foreign corporation we are in an expensive uphill battle. Enbridge is a formidable opponent. Recently they persuaded the trial judge to rule in their favor in a Summary Judgment Order, which says the only thing we can argue about in court is how much Enbridge should have to pay us. We now have to find a way to appeal that decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court (there is no intermediate court of appeals in ND) and ask them to remand the case back to the trial court for a hearing on the merits so we at least are given the opportunity to argue our case! After all, we are the defendants.All of this is very expensive. We are willing and able to stand up for these issues, and are finding lots of support. People from all over have offered encouragement and some have asked if there is a way to contribute to our legal defense fund. Well now there is and THIS IS IT! Your donations go to a charity and are, therefore, tax deductible.We have a good, strong principled legal team. The funds we raise through GoFundMe will go toward our legal defense, including bringing in experts (some of whom have graciously agreed to help for free or for just their out-of-pocket expenses) as well as helping pay the legal team and associated court costs. The cost of this whole effort, including appeals, is expected to be around $125,000. Contributions will be routed through GoFundMe to Plains Justice, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit that has kindly agreed to serve as the fiscal agent. Emily Stark is their Executive Director.None of the contributions will benefit the Botsfords. Any unspent contributions will be divided between Plains Justice (which does related climate change advocacy work) and Honor the Earth (which is also fighting against the Sandpiper pipeline). Please check out the websites of those two fine nonprofit advocacy groups.There have been several news articles written about our case and a google search of ""botsford enbridge"" will show them. Here are links to a sample.Grand Forks Herald Minneapolis Star Tribune FusionPart of our unwillingness to acquiesce to Enbridge's insistent demands is based on their horrendous record of spills and leaks, over 800 in the past decade, as described in a study by the National Wildlife Federation which you can find HERE .Thanks to everyone who has offered encouragement and to those of you who choose to contribute to this important and principled cause.James Botsford+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Save SEALAB I -USA's 1st U/W House,"$5,575","$33,000",Charity," April 24, 2015",45,17,PANAMA CITY BEACH,FL,355000,5,17,"                            Craig Cooper                                                                                                                   PANAMA CITY BEACH, FL                                                        SEALAB I was developed, built, and tested at the Mine Defense Lab, located at the Navy base in Panama City, Fl. The Navy's Man in the Sea Program and its first of three underwater habitats, SEALAB I, was America's first opportunity to field test the results of the Genesis chamber experiments for saturation diving led by Dr. George F. Bond. Using SEALAB I as an underwater base, divers would live, work, eat, and breathe at the bottom of the sea, and the experiment provided unprecedented opportunities for scientific research and development. SEALAB I's experiment took place fifty years ago in 1964 off the coast of Bermuda, where it was deployed at 193 feet, housing four U.S. Navy divers for 11 days. These first American ""aquanauts"" were originally scheduled to stay at depth for 21 days, but the dive was cut short due to the approach of a tropical storm. Those ""sea dwellers"" living almost 200 feet from the surface wouldn't be affected greatly by the storm, but it could wreak havoc on the support vessel above and its umbilical to SEALAB I. Despite its shortened duration, the SEALAB I experiment proved that saturation diving in the open ocean was viable for extended periods, and also provided vital information on habitat deployment, life support control and monitoring. as well as descrambling the Donal Duck speech of Helium breathing divers.CAPT.Bond and several other men from the SEALAB program founded the Institute of Diving and went on to create the Man in the Sea Museum in 1982. The not-for-profit museum is the home of SEALAB I, and the site of its ongoing restoration into a walk-in exhibit of the underwater housethat those four brave pioneers of saturation diving called home for 11 days.For some 30 years SEALAB I has sat with little attention, now on the heels of its 50th anniversary, a group of volunteers has undertaken the task of restoring this historical vessel and re-commissioning it in the configuration as it served as America's first underwater house.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"165 Miles for USO of Illinois  ,"$4,025",$500,Charity," December 27, 2012",73,45,MANHATTAN,KS,435000,2,24,"                            Brian Andries                                                            for UNITED SERVICE ORGANIZATIONSMANHATTAN, KS                                                        Hello.

This is a special homea unique home. This home is a refuge for teen moms and their children who, for numerous reasons, cannot live with their own families  assuming they even have a family. Right now there are nine teenage girls, (four of whom are expecting), and six babies who are living and growing at Haven Home For Girls.The girls house is currently being leased. This is a tremendous expense that will be halved once we are able to purchase the property. Due to a variety of circumstances, Haven Home For Girls is now $15,000.00 in the rears on the property lease. We need to raise this money quickly. Additionally, it is imperative that we raise a down payment of $45,000.00 to purchase the home, allowing us to operate without a deficit. A deadline has been given by the property owners to pay the rent to date by the end of September, or to vacate by the end of October. Nine teenage mothers and their children would be without a home, without the opportunity to be in school, without emotional and relational support, and without the possibility of staying together mother with child. Haven Home for Girls is Christ-centered and family focused. In light of that, we are asked to love one anotherto care for women and childrento do for the least of these. Please open your hearts for the many young mothers and their children who have already suffered much in their livesthat they would have the opportunities and loving guidance to become the families they desire to be.

If people are traversing our educational system and coming out on the other side racist, sexist, xenophobic, classist, or homophobic, then they arent getting enough information about the world in which they live. Something needs to change. I believe an authentic and lasting difference can be made through long term world music and culture study. Honest and true life education. Goal oriented commitment.I offer my community outreach and education initiative: SpecDrum.We need to reach young people from all demographics, classes, and backgrounds, and provide them with culture rich opportunities that enhance their education and character development. We need to immerse them in an environment that is dependent on everyone equally - dependent upon one another. Benefits of SpecDrum include:Life skills: Students who participate learn invaluable lessons in teamwork, leadership, and communication.Acceptance: Students are immersed in a positive, driven atmosphere with other students whom they wouldnt normally be connected to or see as a peer.Self expression: Students learn to express their creativity comfortably at a young age, which is crucial to accepting the creative expression of others.Team building: No one can succeed alone; students learn the importance of function as the part of a larger team to achieve goals together.People who have studied world music and culture are some of the most accepting, talented, and understanding people I know. For two decades, I've seen how all-inclusive drumming events can break the barriers of race and wealth, and bring people joy! My only regret is that these events are few and far between, and not a continuous part of young peoples lives on a regular basis.SpecDrum is a not-for-profit organization (501c3 pending) offering free, cultural education through drumming as an enrichment to the current pedagogical curriculum. A continual study of world culture through music, year round, not just a once a year presentation in the school gymnasium.-SpecDrum is a free service to the community. (This funding campaign is for a two year budget)-Students from any school district in the St. Louis Metropolitanarea will be eligible to apply. (Student applications will be available once funding is secured)-Initially for grades 8-12. (future expansion to include younger students)-SpecDrum is an ongoing venture, ideally becoming a part of the community's cultural landscape.-Transportation to and from rehearsals/performances to be provided as needed. Rehearsals weekly.-Each student (20-30 initially) will receive an instrument to take home for practice between rehearsals.-Instruments of the highest quality, hand made in Guinea, West Africa by drum makers who are compensated accordingly; not factory produced instruments.-Performances will be given at all represented school districts as well as public presentations.Fortunately, SpecDrum has a home! The Kranzburg Arts Foundation is supporting this endeavor by offering a space for practice and performance in the new .ZACH Performing Arts Incubator and the Kranzburg Arts Center, both of which are in the Grand Center District of St. Louis. That leaves the purchasing of instruments as the second major requirement.The majority of the funds from this campaign will go towards the purchasing of fifty to sixty instruments (an average cost of $500 each). Also covered in this campaign are protective cases for the instruments, transportation costs, costuming, marketing, guest clinicians from around the world, and operational costs for 1-2 years minimum.I am happy to offer you something in return for your donation.

Watching the smiles on the little children's faces as they left the therapy center with their new blanket and knowing how much of a positive  effect it would have on each of those little children started this whole process.  I now have reached out and decided to make blankets for other people across the country  who can not afford to buy the expensive weighted blankets that are being sold online.  The amount of outpouring of love and comments I have received  are a blessing in themselves however I cannot afford to continue to make these without some donations from people that would be willing to help this great cause!

I am president of theYpsilanti Thrift Shop and I am writing this Go Fund Me pageontheir behalf. We need$24,000to replace our roof. Let me tell you about our organization and how we came to be in this fix.The Ypsilanti Thrift Shop has been a charitable organization in Ypsilanti since 1942. We accept donations and have a store where we sell the things we have been given. Our store operates 6 days a week and is totally staffed with volunteers. In fact, our organization is and has always been 100% volunteer. We have over 100 members who work one or two 4 hour shifts a month. Our goal is to help the poor in our community. Last year we gave away over 70% of what we took in sales. Each month, we give to Meals on Wheels, theHope Clinic, Friends in Deed and The Salvation Army. Any money left after our monthly expenses is dispersed to individuals in the community who go through their social worker to reach us. The money is often usedfor someone's security deposit, an unexpected car repair, funeral expenses, or keeping utilities from being shut off. There is a tremendous need in our community and we are happy that we can help. In 1972, our organization was fortunate to be able to buy the building that we are currently in.This has been beneficial in that we do not have to pay rent. We set aside a savingaccount with $10,000. to cover any building repairs. In retrospect, we should have been putting more into this fund. Our building is over a hundred years old. It is brick,and we had been looking into getting the brick repaired when the roof started to leak. This brings us to where we are today. We need to do brick repair and replace the roof.  Asof our board of directors meeting on July 15, 2016, we decided to temporarily stopgiving money to all of the charities and individuals that I mentioned above.  This was a hard decision to make because the need is so great. We will resume giving once we have our roof money. We are a small business. Saving all the money that we make, it will still take us months before we have the total amount for the roof. One of our members is writing a grant request, but this takes time and we need this roof done before winter. I have talked with banks about a loan and that has not worked out. We have talked with different organizations in the city and have not found any that can help. Times are tough all over.  We even have a ""Donate to our Roof"" container on our counter in the store. Any amount that you can donate to our roof fund will be greatly appreciated. Please help us get back to where we can help our community again. We are a 5013c charitable organization and will send you a receipt for tax purposes if you request it. Our web site is www. http://thriftshopofypsi.org/ Visit our website and look at the pictures of our shop. Our store is located at 14 South Washington Street, Ypsilanti, Mi 48197.

In the morning hours of December 14th, 2015 Danny, our friend, colleague, and member of Tower Ladder 34 lost his life in a line of duty death fighting a warehouse fire on the southeast side of Chicago. Beyond being a courageous fireman, Danwas a selfless manthat was endeared by anyone who came to know him. Hisquick wit and dry humor provided constant comic relief at the firehouse. He was also known and admired for his dedication and love for his wife Julie and three children, Amanda, Andrew, and Nick. Sadly, this is the second time our firehouse has experienced such a huge loss. On December 22, 2010, Corey Ankum, also a member of Tower Ladder 34, lost his life fighting a fire just a few short blocks from the firehouse he servedDue to the generous donations of our friends in the community, we were able to memorialize Coreys sacrifice through the bronzing of his helmet that is displayed with his boots and fire coat in Engine 72's quarters.It is our mission to honor Danny with a similar memorial.  We are seeking donations to meet our $12,000 goal in order tobronzeDanshelmet, bunker pants, and fire boots that will be ondisplay inthe Fallen Firefighter Memorial Hallway at the Quinn Fire Academy. In addition,a second bronzed helmet and Dan's fire gear will be memorialized next to Corey's at Engine 72.  These memorials at the fire academy and in our firehouse help us keep our fallen brothers alive in our hearts and their families in our thoughts.Any funds received that exceed the payment for the bronzing of items will be donated directly to Dan's family.

We spoke with the mother and found out that she was homeless and had been sleeping under the bridge of I4 for a few weeks while their father went out daily looking for work. As a coping mechanism she told her sweet children that they were on an extended camping trip in hopes of protecting them from the realization that they were homeless.  We took them back to our office and began to call around to shelters and there was absolutely no space available. A few small donations were made and we put up the rest of the funds from our own pockets to put the family up in a hotel for a week. And provided food and hygienne products to them through Attorney Johnson's charitable organization BIG SIS, Inc.  ( www.bigsis.org) Additionally, Attorney Collins got them some clean and dry clothes and a few toys for the kids. The father desperately wants to work and provide for his family.  Through the assistance of friends we were able to secure employment for the father. But we need your help!!! Stable permanent living arrangements still need to be worked out for after this week at the hotel is over. Right now they are safe, have a place to sleep, food in their bellies and dad now has a job. And the family was shown love and given hope. We are now raising funds in hopes of putting them into an apartment , paying their security deposit and rent for a few months and obtaining furniture for them, as this is a family that has lost everything. We are also assisting with getting the children enrolled in school/childcare and prenatal care for the mother as she prepares to give birth. Please make a donation to assist with this effort.

Local public health agencies are overwhelmed. Prisons are overflowing. There is a critical shortage of treatment beds. Crimes such as personal property theft, home invasions, bank robberies, vandalizing vacant buildings, and prostitution are all on the rise, as people scramble to feed their habit. Where does it stop? EMS personnel are well-trained in the administering of naloxone, but then the addict is right back on the street looking for more dope. It is a cycle of hopelessness and despair. There is only so much a treatment center can do for the addict in 30 days. Peer groups have great success, but you have to address basic needs like food, shelter, and medical/psychological problems first to get the addict ready for peer counseling. Every organization out there from the law enforcement agencies to public health to treatment centers to peer groups is addressing a part of the problem. But the problem is getting worse, not better. Its time to think O.U.T.side the box.Project O.U.T.Project O.U.T. Inc. is a long-term, inter-disciplinary approach to providing real help for area addicts who are committed to lasting change. Participation in the program can be anywhere from 90 days to 2 years, and it is designed to equip the participant with a variety of sober living skills. Addiction is a physical disease, to be sure. We will partner with licensed healthcare agencies to assist with a safe medical detox. But addiction is not just a medical sickness. It is also a spiritual and mental condition. Treatment must address the whole person: body, mind, and spirit.Project O.U.T. is modeled after the very successful TROSA program in North Carolina, a program which provides long term residential treatment, mentoring, vocational training, education, and job readiness counseling in a therapeutic community setting. Today, TROSA treats about 500 recovering addicts each day at absolutely no cost to the participant. The participants, once trained, are employed in TROSA-operated for-profit businesses that fund the TROSA treatment programs. Its genius! We want to bring that success story to the Eastern Shore, but we desperately need your help.Early SuccessesPROJECT O.U.T. is the brainchild of retired Food Technologist with the U.S. Dept. of AgricultureRobert J. Williams of Delmar, MD. Having worked in prison ministry and mentoring, Robert saw a need for a different type of treatment center. Last year, he gathered some like-minded colleagues and headed south to North Carolina to meet with the TROSA leadership to learn how they got started. What they saw at TROSA reaffirmed their belief that recovery is possible, that addicts who really want to make a change can live sober, productive, and meaningful lives. Lives with dignity. We sought 501(c) (3) status from the IRS and from the MD Office of taxation and Assessments. In 2015, we achieved that goal. We are now an officially registered charity and your donations are tax-deductible.Project O.U.T. has also contacted members of the Salisbury business community for help. We have the support of the following businesses (and want you to support them right back!): Community Foundation of the Eastern Shore Game Face Grooming Greater Salisbury Committee Long and Foster Real Estate Pohanka Automotive Group Salisbury Area Chamber of Commerce Salisbury University Perdue School of Business Schmidt Bakery Telamon Corporation Telewire Inc.We have created our mission statement and by-laws. We are in the process of putting together our Administrative Board and Advisory Board, and someone very generous has contacted us about a possible land/building donation. This is still in process but it represents a huge donation possibility and gives us the jump start we need.Now we begin our fundraising efforts in earnest, and we are hoping you can help us.How You Can HelpPlease prayerfully consider donating to Project O.U.T. by making a cash donation to this Go Fund Me page. Your donation is tax-deductible and will have a direct impact on the quality of life here on the Eastern Shore. This program can literally pull people out of despair and physical brokenness. It can restore families. It can create jobs. It can reduce poverty and crime.But we need to think in new ways to realize this dream.We need a long-term residential treatment facility in this area and a program that follows participants from detox, to treatment, to job training, to transitional housing, to permanent housing and permanent employment.Think O.U.T.side the box and show your support for Project O.U.T. today.

To date 65 million refugees have been forced to leave their lands, homes, cultures, comforts, friends, jobs, schools, and sometimes even their family members. A very small percentage of those 65 million have been relocated to the United States, and an even smaller percentage have been relocated to Northern California.While the idea of a refugee coming from a 3rd world country to beautiful Northern California may seem very fortunate, the reality is that once a refugee arrives here, it is extremely difficult to flourish. Many noble organizations currently exist to provide basic needs and guidance, but because of the sheer volume of those needs very few are able to fully address the long-term goal of assimilation. Furthermore, almost every organization I've met and researched is primarily geared towards adults. For these reasons, I've decided to launch a non-profit organization supporting refugee youth called At Home Humanitarian.At Home Humanitarian goals:1) Help refugee youth, and their families, feel at home in their communities.2) Provide non-refugee Bay Area youth and families an alternative humanitarian experience at home vs. abroad.3) Guide refugee youth through becoming self-sufficient and preparing for a college education.4) Foster friendships, learning, tolerance, and healing among all participants.To reach these goals, I'm in the process of organizing and funding a 1-week summer retreat for refugee youth and permanent Bay Area residents (could be you!) to come together.The purpose of the retreat will be to build lasting relationships among all participants as well as provide a place of healing, learning, discovery, and experiencing the great outdoors. Post-retreat, each refugee will be assigned an At Home Ambassador (from attending non-refugee participants) who will continue to support their new friends through monthly meetups and outings.There are a few other really exciting and beneficial aspects to this program such as quarterly community reunions and extracurricular grants, but I'll let you read up about all that here . In the meantime, funds to launch (retreat center costs, marketing, and achieving NPO status) are essential. I'm already working with a couple NPO's that would nominate deserving and motivated youth.If you are not able to donate funds at this time, I will also absolutely accept emotional support. Which includes, but is not limited to: encouraging words, insights, high fives, posting this to all your social media accounts, and mass emails to all your friends, family members, coworkers, Google/Yahoo! groups, and mysterious email addresses in your contacts, of people you can't quite remember (sorry if thats how I have your address).I'm hoping to reach my goal of $30K by January 1, 2017. Can you help make this happen?Maya Angelou said it best when she said, The ache for home lives in all of us, a safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned."" Please help me help those who ache, more than most of us ever have or will, feel At Home.Much love,KatherineObligatory clause: At Home Humanitarian is not yet an NPO and as such any donations given at this point will not be tax-deductible. Rest assured, however, that all donations will go directly to this project and nothing else. A million thank yous for trusting me with this!Also noteworthy: At Home is just starting within the Bay Area. If all goes well, I hope to replicate the program in other states/cities of need, so your donations may eventually help out in your home state :) I'm looking at you, Utah. For now, if you're a Bay Area resident, and are interested in attending this first retreat, please let me know!Still reading? Here's a quick recap:1) Refugee youth need your help.2) Lets give them the same opportunities weve been afforded.3) Donations will help fund the first ever At Home retreat and mentorship program, based in Northern California.4) Donations may also go toward providing extracurricular grants for activities of the refugee's choice (i.e. school soccer team, band, art lessons, etc.)5) Have any insights, special skills, or know of a great location the retreat could be held (I have a couple possibilities but am open to ideas)?

Click Donate Now to give what you can)!Hi,My name is Christian DiRado-Owens and I started Binghamton Food Rescue along with my dedicated team of volunteers consisting of Gil Choi, Brianna Barnett, Corrine Spencer, Eliana Epstein, Arianna Stenta, Maggie Cubic, and Cristina Quinn. We started Binghamton Food Rescue because theres a big problem in our food system -- we throw out huge quantities of food that could otherwise be used to combat food insecurity and hunger.According to the Food and Health Network of South Central New York (FaHN), 12.9% of all residents and 23.8% of children in Broome County do not have reliable access to healthy, nutritious food. These children are more likely to develop life-long health problems like asthma and anemia, as well as speech or motor skills impairments and other non-communicable diseases. Nutrition is essential for all individuals to build healthy, happy, and independent lives. Taking into consideration the FAOs estimate that we throw out 30-40% of all food that passes through our food system, there is a huge gap between the food that we produce and the food insecurity communities experience due to barriers in accessing nutritious food.Binghamton Food Rescue is fighting to change that. In just 45 days, we rescued 5,658.6 pounds of healthy food that would otherwise have been discarded and gave it to people who needed it right here in the Greater Binghamton Area. Our mission is to increase access to nutrition while mitigating waste and promoting a just, sustainable food culture in our hometown.There's a lot more food-waste that could be used to feed food-insecure communities struggling with hunger and malnutrition, but we need your help to make that happen.Heres what 100% of your donations will go to:Equipment  Refrigerators, coolers, rescue bins, bicycles, bike trailers. The stuff that helps us get food from donors and bring it to people in need.Community Outreach  reaching new volunteers, partners, and donors who will help us secure and transport food.Acquiring non-profit status  This will allow us to apply for grants and encourage large retailers and other organizations to donate more of their food waste, drastically expanding our food donor base.

Earth Rebirth is a nonprofit focused on empowering people to take food, energy and water into their own hands.The last year has been filled with heartwarming experiences, empowering events, and countless individuals in the community who are passionate to build a world where we can take care of each other. While Earth Rebirth has anticipated a fall fundraiser, we did not anticipate the unfortunate events that would lead the community topush us to launch this effort so suddenly. Yet here we are. So to start, the goal of this campaign is set at $2,000. Every dollar will count and will help tremendously whether we raise 100% of the goal or not.Before explaining the incident mentioned above, I want to reiterate that Earth Rebirthis passionately dedicated to our goals. I (Andrew) have promised for some time now that I will not receive any pay until we have a garden at EVERY school in Norman that contributes to the cafeteria. We have 12 gardens (out of 24 schools), 2 serving the cafeteria. We hope that those who decide to give to this campaign do so NOTjust out of sympathy for what we have gone through but because you have pride and confidence in what we do and can accomplish as an organization. These funds will go to support the medical expenses of Chad Sartain from his hospital trip during the encounter, dental expense from a chipped tooth (and hopefully not worse than that) as well as replace damages and donations lost during the event.Expenses are still being calculated as we go so please be patient with any funding goal changes at this point.On August 26th, 2016, the nightbefore our one year celebration gathering, an incident occurred in which several individuals believed to be from outside of Norman stole the event donation jar from our lobby at the end of a music performance. The amount was unknown in the jars and while expected to be modest, was the jar with most of the night's donations. When the individuals were approached and in possession of the jar, the subjects assaulted Andrew Sartain (ER President) and his younger brother. (Full story in Updates). Chad (who came to Andrew's defense against 8-10 people) sustained injuries to his face and was taken to the hospital to receive stitches in his chin and examine his face to ensure no broken bones or vision damage from his eye. Though the injuries look pretty bad, no broken bones and surgery is not needed.The outpour of support has been heartwarming, while the event still challenges our mindset and emotions. I want to note that the costs of Chad's hospital bills have not been settled yet and he will return for a follow up and removing stitches so we will try to set amounts in the wishlist as we know more.This is a time where we as young individuals must decide if we are on the right track. We chose this career because we want to empower people. To watch your younger brother go through such an experience on your behalf is one thing, but to take place at our business makes the emotions that much worse. We are so grateful for what we have experienced in the last year as we try and create a uique community centerfor Norman. We believe Norman supports that vision.We want to build a community center thatchanges how we view resources. Changes how we work together to use resources. Creates sustainable jobs. Jobs that focus on improving the community, educating your family and lowering your cost to live. People are overhwhelmed with the tasks at hand. We believe that if people have a platform, a place to go - they can and WILL solve their own problems and the problems of their community together. We have so many projects we have yet to get to and we know with all our heart they can drastically improve the community. Community gardens, green roofs, solar initiatives, new product innovations, workshops on demand, innovation station, school garden vendor permits and don't forget the ideas focused on empowering entrepreneurs.The last year has been a tremendous challenge for our organization, one we feel we have succeeded at. And while it is far from over, we know we are not alone. We know that Norman is an incredible community. And we hope the Earth Rebirth Center empowers peoplefor decades in downtown. And we know Earth Rebirth will continue to succeed. But we love Norman and we believe with you behind us, the stars are the limit.

Originally settled by German immigrants from the Rhine River Wine District in the early 1800s, the settlers started Camp Springs rich and multi-generational history of agriculture and wineries that exist today. This unique historic community has many stone masonry properties listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places. The buildings were primarily built from rubble limestone from the creek and surrounding valley areas. At different times in history the properties have served the region as a stage coach stop, taverns, inns, and a grocery store, to name a few. Started in the early 1800s the area remains vibrant in agricultural production today, participating and producing a full range of agriculture products. This unique and proud community continues to serve as a place of welcome for tens of thousands of people each year that visit during special events, purchase agricultural products and services, and use its scenic routes for bike riders and leisure drives. Why Are We Raising Money:Camp Springs way of life and continued historical value is in grave danger of complete erosion or extinction due to an uninformed and destructive local government decision to place a raw sewer pipeline along the Four Mile Creek without community support. This forced decision is causing the residents, many who have been on their properties for generations, to defend their rights through expensive legal proceedings and threat of imminent domain. How Will The Money Be Used:We are being forced to take extraordinary defensive efforts due to the actions of Judge Executive, Steve Pendery and the Sanitation District (SD1). The monies will be used to cover necessary legal cost to preserve and protect Camp Springs. The attorneys supporting the community are committed to assist so much so, they have significantly discounted their rates. Also the community has formed a legal alliance under the name Preserve and Protect Camp Springs against this and other assaults that could cause significant harm. When Do We Need The Money:The community is in need of immediate support to prepare and maintain a sound legal approach demonstrating the environmental impact on Camp Springs and the larger community, lack of sound judgment in the decision, lack of benefit to the larger community, and other relevant issues.Why This Means So Much To The Community:In 2008, the Northern Kentucky Sanitation District #1 in isolation began plans to address sewer overflows in Silver Grove, Kentucky, a neighboring community. While this significantly impacted property owners in Camp Springs, members of the community first learned of the proposed plans in 2010, and there were no public hearing until 2013. The community believes the design they have chosen is not the best option for multiple reasons, chief among which is the destruction of a historic and agricultural community. The pressurized raw sewer pipeline is proposed to run from Silver Grove through Camp Springs Valley along Owl Creek and Four Mile Creek. Some of the major concerns about the project identified by property owners: Decisions were made without timely public input Decision were made with no regard to long-term effects on farming and agri-tourism business to property owners. There will be Damage to historic buildings Great potential for sewer fumes due to the valley Erosion due to loss of trees and theLoss of trees will diminish the look and feel of our historic communityThe community is in support of progress for a cleaner environment yet better options are available to the sanitation districts (SD1) which have largely being ignored. Additionally there is an enormous cost to this project, which will ultimately fall to the taxpayers and with a clear lack of multi-tier benefit. We believe there are better, less costly options with greater community benefit.How Thankful Will We Be:Gratitude for your contributions will be felt by past, current, and future generations that live and visit this cherished historic and agricultural land called Camp Springs.There was a time when meadow, grove and stream, The earth and every common sight  To me did seem  Apparelld in celestial light, The glory and the freshness of a dream.It is not now as it had been of yore; Turn wheresoer I may, By night or day, the things which I have seen I now can see no more.""- William WordsworthThank You - The Community of Camp Springs.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Juvenile Life transition Project,$155,"$2,500",Charity," August 8, 2016",3,1,PORTLAND,OR,594000,3,1,"                            Marvin Young                                                                                                                   PORTLAND, OR                                                        I have been blessed enough to overcome a troubling past that has been a trail throughout the juvenile youth authority onto three adult prison terms. I am now sharing my experiences with adult individuals currently involved within the criminal justice system in an attempt to create opportunities towards them helping themselves overcome A&D addictions and criminal thinking patterns. I believe that the youth today if presented the opportunities that are presented to these individuals with whom I work with prior to their following of my own path could reduce recidivism within the corrections system and become productive citizens within society. I am now a 43 year old husband and father. I was born and raised here in Portland Oregon and began my association with street gangs in 1986. In 1988 I officially became a member. With the election of President Obama I began to really look into my life and then began holding myself accountable for the path that I had traveled. In 2012 I began searching for a way to uplift the young men and women of my community to redeem themselves from the misguidance of my own Era and the Eras that followed it. I sat for months questioning what I believed had been absent during my time housed in both foster homes and group homes . The answers led to my hope of creating a program. My program plan is to provide safe and stable housing for children 9-17 years of age involved in the family Court system as I had been. I am looking to begin this program with a 4-5 bedroom rental property housing two children per room. I hope to purchase a 12 passenger van, have a full time Cook for 5 days a week as well as a part time relief Cook on weekends, I'm looking to assemble a full time staff of 6 and a residential clinician for the children's 1 on 1 weekly progression. Outside of the housing, the counseling, and staff engagement I hope to have each child engaged with their families and building a support system for themselves. Confidence, dreams, and goals I believe should be supported in our youth.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Support College Hill  Co-op!,"$2,980","$30,000",Charity," March 17, 2016",41,6,GREENSBORO,NC,573000,1,8,"                            Jaimee Buccola                                                                                        on behalf of College CooperativeGREENSBORO, NC                                                        College Hill Childcare Co-operative was originally formed in 1981 by parents who were excited to take childcare into their own hands. Starting in homes in the College Hill neighborhood, ""Co-op"" resided in a couple of locations before settling down in the Lindley Park neighborhood in 2004. Here, our children learn through play, and benefit from having parents in the classroom with our amazing, committed teachers. Our community is a tight-knit one; as a co-operative, each family has a voice in maintaining the business. We also play together, hosting our birthday parties and other celebrations with each other, in our home away from home. We are invested in our children, and in keeping this beautiful model successful. Our Co-op has rented space in our current location from a larger daycare provider, who has made the decision to sell the building. This decision leaves 30 days for our Co-op to find a new home. As working parents, we are also now balancing the responsibility of finding a new space that meets building and childcare regulations. Potential spaces require upgrades to accomodate these regulations, and as a non-profit, our Co-op is finding it difficult to fund upgrades, and still be able to actually open for business once it's complete. All money raised will go toward the following: 1) Moving costs: Our parents and teachers are committed to handling as much as we can, but will likely need to utilize the help of a moving company, truck, and lots of coffee. We will also need to store the contents of our daycare until a new space is located.2) Upgrades to a new center. 3) Costs associated with ""starting over again."" Deposits for utilities, insurances, etc. 4) Ensuring we are able to pay our teachers, who have committed to stick through this with all of us. Our Co-op family has stuck together, some of us for many years, through the ups and downs that have come with running a business and raising our kids under one roof. We want to keep this model successful, for our children, and future generations. We thank you, our teachers thank you, and most importantly, our children thank you.**Co-op is a non-profit 501(c)(3) and your donation is tax deductible!

My name is Jamal Grant and I am a recent college graduate and a Mechanical/Aerospace systems engineer based in Boston. Over the last several years , I have gained immense interest in helping others in need. One issue that has become dear to me is the Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) academic achievement gap that is of epidemic proportions in the United States today. In my research on this issue, I have found that at the root of this achievement gap are factors that are both systematic (i.e. under-resourced schools, lack of exposure to STEM and discontinuous access to resources) and social (i.e. poverty, discouraged students, lack of awareness of resources). For these reasons, I have founded an organization called The NET Mentoring group that aims to uniquely tackle the STEM achievement gap by addressing both the systematic and social barriers, simultaneously.The NET Mentoring Group will provide three services that will help us build a pipeline to successful careers, particularly in STEM. The NET will offer: A program that builds students understanding , interest and competency in STEM through programming, tutoring services and exposure to STEM careers. A program that provides students with the guidance, support and knowledge necessary to build the characteristics of mental resiliency, resourcefulness and self-appreciation. We hope to equip students with the tools to reach success despite overwhelming circumstances. The NET website will serve as a one-stop-shop for resources/organizations in Boston where students, parents and teachers (even those not directly involved in The NETs mentoring programs) can go to find resources and ultimately map out a career plan. The website will be particularly powerful in maximizing the collective efforts of the many great resources in the Boston area.New Development: The NET has recently received IRS Federal tax-exempt status and is an offical 501(c)(3). This means that all contributions (past and present) are tax-deductible!Any and all contributions will go toward: STEM materials, food, books and maintenance of our website.Whether you are a friend, colleague or just someone looking to help change the world, your contribution is much appreciated!

His rescuer brought him to usatTWRC Wildlife Center (TWRC), knowingwe have the expertiseand the people to care for theinfant,nurse him to healthand, when he is old enough, release him in the wild to lead the kind of life squirrels are meant to have. Would you help us save babies like this squirrel, and help us care for other wild beings unable tosurvive without our care?TWRC Wildlife Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, founded in 1979, that serves the Greater HoustonArea with the very best in emergency-medical and rehabilitative services for wildlife. Last year we helped care for nearly 5000 wild animals brought to us by the public. We work with veterinarians and trained volunteers to provide services such as anesthesia, X-rays, pain control, wound treatment and administering medications to treat ill and injured wildlife. We have onsite-care programs to provide temporary care until our home-based rehabilitators can take the orphaned and injured animals for further rehabilitation and release. We also provide educational services to the community in the form of wildlife camps and outreach. Our Center provides a place for the public to bring rescued wildlife for care and a hotline to call for advice with any wildlife concerns. Our organization also provides free veterinary-medical services and discounted animal-care supplies for our members, who volunteer as permitted home-based rehabilitators; helping defray the large out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our rehabilitators.In 2014 our operational expenses, including leasing our location, utilities, maintenance of our X-ray machine and other medical equipment, as well as food and supplies for the onsite-care programs, exceeded donations received by about $40,000 and, unless this shortfall can be made up in 2015, some services will have to be cut back or discontinued.TWRC Wildlife Center receives no financial assistance from Federal, State or Local Governmental Agencies; relying solely on tax-deductible donations from private and corporate donors and charitable-giving foundations. With our busiest season beginning, we do not want to turn away any animals in need, or be forced to cut back our community outreach or onsite volunteer opportunities. Please help us continue our mission:To promote environmental conservation through public education and rehabilitation of Texas wildlife! www.twrcwildlifecenter.org+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"RecoveryRockFest 2016,"$2,980","$5,000",Charity," June 14, 2016",32,3,WILMINGTON,NC,467000,1,49,"                            Nyla Cione                                                                                                                   WILMINGTON, NC                                                        Hi Folks!Welcome to the 2016 RecoveryRockFest, nonprofit fundraising page. www.recoveryrockfest.comReal life stories AND real hope!

In 1915, after fires destroyed previous buildings on the site, village philanthropists agreed to erect a structure that would stand the test of time, and in June 1917 The Sherburne Inn held its grand opening.Constructed of brick and poured concrete, The Inn served its patrons well for more than eight decades, with comfortable accommodations, good spirits, and fine food. Located centrally on Sherburne's anchor corner, The Inn was a downtown gathering spot for businesses, neighbors, and families to celebrate life's traditions.In 1990, The Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of Sherburne's historic district. This designation was well deserved for ahotel and restaurantthat once welcomed such renowned individuals as Duke Ellington, Duncan Hines, Bobby Rydell, Jim Braddock, Minnesota Fats, Peter Falk, Johnny Cash, Carl Yastrzemski, and The Ink Spots.In fact, the Inn was awarded the Duncan Hines SilverAnniversaryService Award in 1961,and was featured in a bookauthored by Duncan Hines, Adventures in Good Eating (Mr. Hines ate atThe Inn in the 1930s).All this to say, The Sherburne Inn is not just a building. It is a focal point of our traditions and our rural culture, a vital and important piece of central New York history and, indeed, of Americana itself.In October 2012, The Sherburne Inn -- which had stood empty and abandoned since 2002 -- was threatened with demolition, to be replaced by an all-night convenience shop and gas station. Once again, village philanthropists stepped forward to preserve not just an historic corner, but a way of life in this small community.Save The Sherburne Inn Restoration Project (SSIRP), formed with nine board members in 2012, was incorporated in January 2013 andpurchased thebuilding three months later. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the organization is eligible for grant awards, and spent several years fundraising, planning, and establishing a solid infrastructure for the restoration and re-opening of this historically-significant building. ""Infrastructure"" included hiring such professional consultants as preservation architects Crawford & Stearns and Rich & Gardner Construction Company. As of July 2015, when construction began, SSIRP had committed funds of nearly $1.3 million toward its $3 million goal, including two $500,000 economic development grants from New York State,a $50,000 grant from the Howard K. Finch Memorial Fund, and a $25,000 matching grant from NBT bank of Sherburne. In November 2015, we received another commitment of a $25,000 matching grant, this one from the Chobani Foundation.We still need another $1.7 million to complete the job.When reopened, The Inn (as it is known locally) will feature:-a farm-to-table restaurant, supporting local farmers and producers and offering healthy and delicious seasonal fare-a street-level bar, for after-work and after-dinner drinks-a lower-level pub, for live music and gathering of friends around the fireplace -event space,for wedding receptions, class reunions, family get-togethers, birthdays, retirement dinners, school proms, school dances, and theme parties-meeting space, for service organizations, senior citizen classes,and corporate gatherings-office space, to enhance our business district-retail space, with shops, a salon, and a fitness center-residence rooms, for the long-term residence needs of business professionals; and-hotel guest rooms: beautifully appointed and unique, answering acall forsleeping rooms in our countyAppreciating the efforts being made by local volunteers to bring this project to completion -- and even more, appreciating the importance of this building to the community --the localfinancial institution, NBT Bank of Sherburne, has taken on the role of lead corporate donor and has awarded SSIRP a $25,000 matching grant. In order to receive these funds, SSIRP must match the grant dollar for dollar, with matching fundsaccepted onlyfrom individuals and businesses (not fromother grants). NBT Bank is committed to supporting the local communities we serve,"" said NBT Bank Territory Manager Thomas Sutton in July 2015. ""We are pleased to partner with Save the Sherburne Inn Restoration Project to help them reach their goal of restoring the historic Sherburne Inn. The Inn is a vital part of Sherburnes history and is important to the communitys future. We are delighted to take on the role of lead corporate donor to help move this project forward. We hope our commitment inspires others to donate to this cause.Chobani expressed similar sentiments:Giving back to the communities in which we live and work is one of Chobanis founding values, Jeff Genung, senior manager of corporate communications at Chobani said on Monday. Save the Sherburne Inn Restoration Project represents the perfect opportunity to support an effort that aligns with our core beliefs  a grassroots movement to restore purpose to something others once thought had outlived its usefulness. Much like our first factory in South Edmeston, The Sherburne Inn has been rescued from the wrecking ball and will soon be alive again with activity and vitality. Chobani is proud to help usher in a second lease on life for this important and historic part of the Sherburne community.That is what this GoFundMe campaign is all about: matching our NBT and Chobani grants.Since the beginning, SSIRP has depended upon those in Sherburne and in surrounding communities who share our vision, and we look forward to welcoming all of you for dinner, drinks, business meetings, and special events when the lights come back on at The Sherburne Inn.

I live in Columbia, MO with my parents Kathy and Rodney, Sr. I started this campaign because the house that my parents are living in is uninhabitable by modern standards. For example, for heat we use an old-fashioned fireplace which I collect wood for every summer for use during the winter. The fireplace unfortunately leaks smoke into the house and, with winter coming soon, we face a choice between the lesser of two evils: go without heat or risk inhaling smoke. The electrical wiring is also in disrepair, to the point where we are forced to use extension cords throughout the house to power our lives. Also, the foundation is falling apart, resulting in cracks throughout the house and the baseboards falling apart. The ceiling leaks as well in multiple areas throughout the house when it rains or snows. Needless to say, the living conditions leave much to be desired. At this point, you might be wondering how we got here. To make a long story short, my father suffered severe neck and back injuries on the job when he fell off of a ladder in his 40's. At that point, I was 12. Regrettably, 14 years passed before my father every received compensation for his work-related injuries. As a result of the often drawn out, expensive, and adversarial legal system that families like mine are forced to navigate through (on top of the physically disabling injury, might I add), my family's finances took a major hit. My mother responded by picking up a second FULL TIME job and I followed suit, contributing what I was able to. Nonetheless, times remain tough.Most recently, another financial obstacle presented itself: my family is being forced to connect to Columbia's public sewer system even though we have our own private septic system (more info here:  http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/columbia_infrastructure/sewer/homeowners-upset-over-sewer-compliance-cost/article_a9f04645-ddf0-5dfc-9468-6ee6b7c607e9.html)This connection could cost upwards of $10,000.00 and, if we are unable to pay we risk losing our home, where we've lived for literally as long as I can remember.I share this information in hopes of inducing you to either share this post or to consider donating (or both!). Even if you could contribute $5, please know that every bit helps out in an urgent situation. My family is like most others that you know and love; we work hard, we help who we can when we can, and we continue to stay positive in the face of adversity.We are not looking for a hand OUT, but rather a hand UP. Thanks for reading and I pray that you will consider how you might be able to help.Bottom line: my parents are good people and deserve to live in decent conditions but the hardships they deal with on a day to day basis as described above are unimaginable for the average American in the Midwest.I hope to do better by them and, with your help, I can make my dream a reality!+ Read More"Asylum for Central American Women,"$3,390","$20,000",Charity," September 13, 2016",27,12,BOSTON,MA,67000,,,"                            Will Rico                                                            for IRISH INTERNATIONAL IMMIGRANT CENTER INCBOSTON, MA                                                        Imagine living in the grip of constant fear.Gang violence and drug cartels surround you, day in and day out. You are afraid for your life and the lives of your children so you summon all your courage and flee to an unknown land, taking only what you can carry.This is the plight of hundreds of innocent women and their children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala whose only crime was being born in the wrong place.Over 80 women and their children are living here in Massachusetts and urgently need our help.Let's help resettle these families and welcome them to Massachusetts. Your tax deductible donation funds a bilingual case manager, specialized in trauma, who will help them get the support they need to build happy, healthy and productive lives.Without your support, these women and children may not be able to pursue their asylum cases and may be sent back to the violence they have fled.Who Created This Campaign & WhyThis campaign was created by Bev Freeman and Will Rico, two members of the Needham Area Immigration Justice Task Force.Message from Will: I visited Karnes prison, in Karnes City, TX to meet with women and children who crossed the border seeking asylum. I will never forget their stories or faces. Who could forget meeting a four year old girl who fled horrific violence in Guatemala only to spend 1/4 of her life in prison?I felt the powerlessness of these women and children and it angered me. I wrote letters and met with an aide to one of our senators, but I can't say it accomplished much.Then, we realized that there is something we can do for those women and children who, if released, make their way to Massachusetts. We could give them the support they need to create a life and a better chance at winning their asylum cases.Bev did the due diligence and selected the Irish International Immigrant Center as our partner and we couldn't be happier with the choice.To put this plan into action, we ask for your financial generosity and generosity of spirit. Please give power to these women and children who have been so brave and strong throughout their ordeals, but who are at terrible risk if we don't support them now.With love, peace and our deepest appreciation,Will Rico & Bev Freeman                    + Read More"Golden Boy benefit for Parkinson's,"$6,506","$50,000",Charity," July 13, 2016",37,2,NEW YORK,NY,59000,1,,"                            Alex Montaldo                                                                                                                   NEW YORK, NY                                                        A VERY SPECIAL PRODUCTIONWe are very excited to invite you to a very special event.StoPD (Support and Training to Overcome Parkinson's Disease) presents 'Golden Boy', written by Clifford Odets and directed by Aaron Latham. This will be a full theatrical production in collaboration with our sponsors Gleason's Gym, Shetler Studios, The Dulanski Group and Energy and Lighting Systems, Ltd. Performed at Gleason's Gym, the world famous boxing mecca that contributed to inspiring Odets back in 1937, this play is going to entertain you, move you and most importantly show you how much stronger than Parkinson's we/you are!This revival of Odets masterpiece will be directed by our very own Aaron Latham, Parkinson's warrior, journalist, playwright and author of such movies as 'Urban Cowboy' and 'The Program'. This production is a tribute to the Parkinson's community and a testament to its strength and potential. Our 'Golden Boy' will feature professional actors who are living with Parkinson's in some of the main roles. Furthermore, many of our production and creative team members have Parkinson's and contributed decisively to build this project from the ground up.Lastly, our Alex Montaldo, co-founder of stoPD, will be playing the title character of Joe Bonaparte.All the proceeds will go into funding stoPD new programs in New York and Los Angeles and the Michael J Fox Foundation.We believe that the most effective way of battling Parkinson's is improving the quality of life of those who are living with it in the present while striving for a cure. A CLASSIC PLAY IN A CLASSIC SETTINGStoPD (Support and Training to Overcome Parkinson's disease) is an organization devoted to bettering the quality of life of people with Parkinson's and their families. We are currently developing various exercise and art programs specifically designed for Parkinson's. Our first program was boxing. In 2014, we literally put on boxing gloves to fight back against Parkinson's disease, and kept boxing ever since.We punch the heavy bag, the speed bag, various rubber dummies, and our instructor. And it does help a lot. But to keep doing what we are doing we have to raise some money. So we went looking for some kind of fundraiser that would involve boxing. We settled on doing a boxing play. By mounting a play, with Parkinson's sufferers acting in a few roles, working as stage hands, sewing costumes, painting on makeup, and even directing the show, we would prove that there is life after this affliction. But what boxing play should we use? We wanted a classic proved by time. The best of these had to be Golden Boy. Where would we put on Golden Boy? The answer seemed to be right in front of us. After all, we work out three times a week in the most famous and most historic boxing gym in the world. And we could have it for free. Staging shows in real places  so called site-specific productions -- are becoming more and more popular. In New York City, an opera with a herd of sheep was recently produced in an armory. We decided to join the trend. Odets himself was aware of Gleasons Gym and visited it soon after it opened in 1937, the same year Golden Boy opened. It has an aura and a layout that has allowed it to be used as a movie set and performance space many times over the years. ""We've done 26 full-length movies here, and four of them won Academy Awards,"" says gym owner Bruce Silverglade.One of the biggest movies made at Gleasons was Raging Bull (1980) starring Robert De Niro who played legendary world champion Jake LaMotta. They chose Gleasons because it really was where the legendary fighter learned to fight. It looked real because it was real. De Niro, who learned to box at Gleasons, won the Academy Award as best actor. ""I fought hundreds and hundreds of rounds in Gleason's Gym and that's where I really developed,"" he told Reuters in a recent interview. ""I was the only main event, the main fighter that was training there, then they all started to come there."". Among those who followed Jake to Gleasons were Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Michael Spinks, Roberto Duran, and Larry Holmes. And right behind fighters came the movie people. The next big boxing picture shot at Gleasons was Million Dollar Baby (2004) starring Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank. The gym was not only her set but also her coach. Hector Roca made a fighter of her and will be training our lead Alex Montaldo.                                          Aaron Latham'Golden Boy', directed by Aaron Latham, will entertain you and move you, while bringing awarness about Parkinson's disease.Play your part and make a donation to support Parkinson's research and a better quality of life for patients and their families.                    + Read More"UWC USA for Cancer ,"$1,208","$1,500",Charity," September 13, 2016",33,11,MONTEZUMA,NM,235000,,,"                            Nora Vn                                                                                                                   MONTEZUMA, NM                                                        Hi everyone, we need your help!

Au cours des sessions 3, 4 et 5, les tudiantes sont places en stages dans lune des 13 maisons de naissances au Qubec, allant de Gatineau  Rimouski!

La session 7 est un stage en milieu hospitalier. Les sessions 8 et 9 sont les derniers stages et se ralisent dans une maison de naissance diffrente de la premire srie de stages.En rsum, les tudiantes sages-femmes sont donc pour la plupart sans domicile fixe durant 4 ans!

Chaque don compte! Donnez gnreusement!Student midwives in Quebec have a crazy project To own and manage a collective house, in order to meet the unique and specific needs of midwives in training. Is it possible? We have the audacity to think that it is, especially with your support. We know, and have met, hundreds of people, both in Quebec and elsewhere, who support our idea: families, midwives, birth attendants, doulas, health care professionals, etc. We are now, more than ever, in need of your financial support in order to kick start this ambitious yet realistic project.Who are we?Student midwives in Quebec.To be more specific, we are a committee of 16 student midwives enrolled in a bachelors of midwifery practice (a midwifery education program) at lUniversit du Qubec  Trois-Rivires (UQTR). The group is representative of the 4 cohorts and the body of student midwives in Quebec, which totals about 80 students. We have founded a non profit organization called: l Auberge Autogr des tudiantes Sages-Femmes Qubcoises (AASFQ) through which we will manage this project.What will we do with $20 000?Create a student-run residence.As we all know, it costs more than $20 000 to buy a home. The money we wish to raise here will contribute to our ongoing fundraising efforts. Our objective of raising $20 000 represents about 10% of the total value of the project. The money raised through our Gofundme campaign will contribute mainly to a down payment on the residence, so that we can start welcoming students in September of 2016.What is the reality of being a student midwife in Quebec?The midwifery training program is a bachelor's degree that extends over 9 semester and 4 and a half years.The first two semesters (the first year) is held on campus in Trois-Rivires 3 days a week.For the 3rd, 4th,and 5th semesters students are on placements in one of the 13 birthing centers across Quebec, extending from Gatineau to Rimouski.Student must live within 30 minutes of the location of their placement which usually implies moving several times throughout the program.Before each placement students must return to Trois-Rivires for a week of intensives courses.The sixth semester in on campus at UQTR 2 days a week.The 7th semester is a placement in a hospital.The 8th and 9th semesters are the last placement, and internship, and are completed at a different birthing center than the first placements.Basically what this means is that many student midwives are without a fixed address and consistent home for the 4 years of their program. Others live on the road between their family, UQTR, and the location of the placements. The expenses related to the students stay in Trois-Rivires is added to the cost of living in various different places across Quebec. Even though students are resourceful, and able to juggle the logistics, it remains a complex and expensive feat.How is this project unique?It responds to a collective issue around individual housing challenges.Becoming owners and operators of our own residence will allow us to renovate the space, manage the residence for and by student and provide a sustainable solution to our housing issues. What will the residence look like?One large common living space for meetings and that could be use as a dorm for students who occasionnaly need a place to stay in Trois-Rivires5 to 8 closed rooms for students that are living full time in Trois-Rivires.A study room containing a library and reference books.A collective kitchen.Possibility of having a daycare service for students moms.Several parking spaces and collective bicycles.Who are our current partners?- The midwives association of Quebec (Regroupement les sages-femmes du Qubec)- The UQTR student union (Association gnrale tudiante de lUQTR)- The UQTR Midwife student union (Association des tudiantes sages-femmes du Qubec)- The UQTR foundation (Fondation de lUQTR)- The innovation and economic development group in Trois-Rivires (Innovation et dveloppement conomique Trois-Rivires) - The midwifery University program - Transport Petit- Mathilde Cinq-Mars, illustrator- Granby Zoo- Andranne Fortin, massage therapist - Olivier Turcotte alias Jos Violon, story-teller- KiNipi spa- Spa & Htel Le Finlandais- Loblaws- Polar Bear's Club- Abaka  Responsible clothing- Morgane coffee shop (Caf Morgane)- Charles Lavoie, artist- William Cyr-Lamy, Barborange (logo)- Bourassa Maill architectes- The sport event ""Une fille qui court""- Salon Orchide- La Meraki, boutique-atelier- lise Martineau, photographe- Benoit Scherer, artisteIn addition to your financial donations, all furniture and amenities are welcome to furnish the residence.

The country of Greece, and especially the island of Lesvos, have recently been flooded with refugees coming from many countries, such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. These men, women, and children are leaving everything and coming to escape war and persecution, in hopes of finding a peacefullife for themselves and their families. The issue now is that Lesvos cannot support these refugees with the basic necessities of life. Despite the economic crisis in Greece, the Greek people have tried to support the refugees as much as possible, with the limited resources that they have. For this reason, the island of Lesvos has been referenced as 'The Island of Solidarity', and its people have been nominated for The Nobel Peace Prize.The refugee crisis in Lesvos isnot an issue forGreece alone, but it is the responsibility ofevery one of usto support solving this humanitarian crisis.We have decided to launch a fundraiser to help provide basic needs to this community. The money we have collected, and will continue to collect, will go to a local non-governmental association that has been active in aiding these people. The name of the organization is 'Syniparxi'. You can learn more about this organization at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/514654685298655/.Translation is available directly on the page.This NGO is part of a greater alliance of local NGOs named, 'Village Altogether'. Your donation will go directly to the causewithout any overhead/administrative fees. Current projects include:- Providing blanets and water on the shores of Lesvos for immediate relief to newly arriving refugees- Making and delivering food to Kara Tepe refugee camp- Biweekly excursions for unaccompanied minors staying atMoria Refugee Camp.

For the English version continue reading below. Thank you!    :  http://justice4toveet.comfor more information please click on this link above)My name is Khaya Osher. My family and I are close friends of the family of Toveet Radcliffe who died on her base while serving in the IDF at 19 years old. The military is claiming that her death was a suicide, but overwhelming evidence has been gathered to prove otherwise (Please see the link above for videos demonstratingsome of this evidence including this one below).However her family does not have the money to pay for the court fees and lawyer to proceed with this case, so we are raising funds to pay for the evidence gathered, lawyer fees, court fees and fees of the experts who will be hired in the case to complete a new and separate investigation from what the military has done. (As of the beginning of July 2016, we have raised enough money for part of the lawyer's retainer fees as well as forensics experts for the case. The case is moving forward but we need continued support to keep things moving in the right direction. Please consider donating what you can to help. Thank you!)If we can get 1000 people to donate $25 each we will be able to make sure her family gets the support they need to proceed with her case and also that the case gets the media coverage that it deserves. The family deserves answers to their questions. For more information about this situation you can read the following article quoted below:The family of Toveet Radcliffesays it is unsatisfied with the outcome of an Israeli army investigation into the young soldiers death, and will appeal the Military Advocate Generals decision to close the inquiry into her untimely demise. Toveets family members, especially her mother Khydijah, remain unconvinced by the IDFs claims regarding the circumstances and cause of her death.Last week, nearly a full year after Toveets passing, the Israeli Air Force submitted its official report to the Radcliffe family, which concluded that no other person had been involved in the nineteen-year-olds death. Examination of the aggregate of evidence leads to the conclusion that there is no documented proof of the involvement of others in the death of the Deceased, the IDF report stated. In ruling out murder or other foul play, the report suggested Toveet committed suicide.The news came as a crushing blow to her family and friends in the African Hebrew community in Dimona, Israel. The community was initially established in 1969 by African-Americans who immigrated to Israel after embracing Hebraic spiritual practices in the United States. The first wave of African Hebrews was treated as all other dark-skinned Jewish immigrants: sent to small towns, like Dimona, in Israels periphery and given furnished apartments and work permits.Toveet was the first member of this community, as well as the first African-American to die while serving in the Israeli army. Incredibly, she was also the great-great-grand-niece of African American heroine and abolitionist, Harriet Tubman.African Hebrews Trade Service for CitizenshipIn Israel, only Jews are legally required to serve in the armed forces. While Toveet was not Jewish, serving in the army could still have had its appeal for her. Military service can significantly improve ones economic prospects, as a number of professions are effectively unavailable to those who have not served in the army. These circumstances have an oversized effect on low-income families like Toveets.But, economics is not the only reason why someone like Toveet might decide to serve in the military. As the child of African Hebrew Israelites, she had another powerful incentive to serve: the promise that she, as well as her mother, could apply for full-fledged Israeli citizenship upon her discharge.Shortly after African Hebrews began immigrating to Israel, in the early 1970s, authorities realized that their Afro-centric spiritual practices were markedly different from both Occidental and Oriental Orthodox Judaism, which are the only state-approved streams of the faith. Because they were no longer considered Jewish, the Israeli government spent the next few decades attempting to expel all African Hebrews from the country.Ultimately, the Israeli government relented and agreed to permit the community, which numbered only a few thousand members, to remain in the country, but only as temporary residents. There was one loophole, however. African Hebrews could obtain full citizenship if they or at least one of their children completed their army service.Operating Patriot Missiles Far from the FrontlineAt the time of her death, Toveet was responsible for the operation of American-manufactured Patriot surface-to-air missiles at Palmachim, an Israeli Air Force base on the Mediterranean coast about half an hour south of Tel Aviv. Sometime between 10:00 PM and midnight on February 21, 2015, Toveet died on that base.In the early hours of February 22, 2015, army representatives came to the Radcliffe home in Dimona to break the tragic news of her death. Toveets mother Khydijah recalled those critical moments:I asked how many people died. I thought that some terrorists went up there to on their base and started shooting people.Or, I thought that she had died in a bus blow up, a bus crash or something.They said that no, she was on the base; she was on her own.They said that she had died by herself.I said, By herself? How? They said she was in her room.She wouldnttell me how at first, she said that she was in her room.We found her dead in her room by herself. I asked if it was food poisoning She said no, that she was shot.I asked if she was shot, how?What do you mean that she was shot?The soldiers left the Radcliffe home in the early hours of the morning. Later that same week, another contingent of IDF troops visited the Radcliffe family with a different story about how Toveet had died. This time, they claimed Toveets limp body was discovered in a small guard booth on the base. When they came a few days later, thats when they said she was found on patrol, Khydijah recalls.The IDF Story Has Changed over TimeThe specific location of Toveets body is not the only part of the IDFs story that has changed over time. Khydijah says IDF soldiers first told her Toveet died from two bullets to the head. Later, the story was revised; the official IDF report released last week states that Toveet died as a result of a single bullet that pierced her brain.These contradictions, among others, have eaten away at Khydijahs confidence in the IDF. Her suspicions started to grow when Toveets friends told her IDF investigators were questioning them about Toveets mental state, suggesting she may have been morose because of her familys financial situation and capable of self-harm.Everybody loved her.Everyone that she met, she always touched their soul and their spirit.She was very happy, Khydijah said.Of course all teenagers go through their hormonal depressions, but she was very strong-spirited, she had a lot of plans and she loved living life. She loved life to the fullest and she had a lot of plans of things that she wanted to do.Khydijah insists that Toveet would never have willingly ended her own life. She wanted to travel when she got out of the military.She wanted to take [her siblings] M and S [names redacted] to New York, says Khydijah, noting that Toveet was in touch with her cousins in the States. They made plans to travel and go to a few places in America.So, all of these plans, I know that she was not planning on hurting herself.Physically Impossible Gunshot TrajectoryToveets family and friends are most skeptical about the IDFs claims regarding the method the young soldier allegedly used to kill herself. The thing that hurts me more is that I dont know what happened to her, that hurts more, Khydijah says.The IDF report posits that Toveet held the barrel of her M-16 rifle up to the front of her forehead with her left hand, and that she held the rest of the rifle up in the air with her right hand at least level with her head, if not higher, while simultaneously pulling the trigger with that same hand.Now, it is perfectly possible for a person to aim the barrel of an M-16 rifle at ones own head and pull the trigger. The easiest way to do this would be to place the butt of the gun on the ground and hold the barrel up to ones chin. Alternatively, one could insert the barrel into ones own mouth. It is even theoretically possible for a person to hold the barrel up to her own temple, and shoot herself in the side of the head.The IDFs version of Toveets suicide would, however, be a far more challenging thing to accomplish for a young woman measuring 5 feet 8 inches  Toveets height as recorded by the army autopsy. It would have been physically impossible, however, for a young woman measuring 5 feet 3 inches  Toveets actual stature.With a barrel of an M-16 flush with her forehead and the body of the gun extending forward either level or sloping upwards, Toveets arms would have been too short to reach the trigger, about twenty-one inches away.If Toveet had insisted on shooting herself in this odd way, she could have theoretically held a thick stick or other hard object in her hand and used it to depress the trigger. The IDF report does not, however, mention any object found at the scene that fits this description.If, as the IDF pathologist proposed, Toveet held the gun up to her own forehead with one of her hands, that hand might be expected to have traces of powder particles and soot. The pathologist did not, however, report finding any such chemical byproducts on Toveets hands.Toveets Family Seeks AnswersEven if Toveet had been a Jewish Israeli citizen, her family would have likely faced challenges in holding the Israeli army to task and receiving answers to their questions. But because Toveets family members are not Israeli citizens, and do not vote in federal elections, they have no elected officials to turn to for help.Without disposable income to pay the fees for a lawyer, Khydijah has had no choice but to confront Toveets army commanders herself. I didnt bite my tongue.I told the commanders and I told her friends.I said that somebody on the base with my daughter hurt my daughter, I said that she did not do that to herself.I know my child, and there is no secret to how I feel, Khydijah recalls.I feel that whatever happened that it had to be a big person that arranged this, to do this, to cover something like this up.I wouldnt be saying this if they hadnt said that my daughter killed herself. I dont want you all to tarnish my daughters character, Khydijah says.Khydijahs decision to be outspoken about her daughters death was not lightly taken. She remains fearful that her confrontational stance toward the army could prompt officials to deny the rights of Toveets two brothers and sister, who Khydijah continues to raise, as a single parent, on her meager disability pension.The IDF RespondsAttempts were made to obtain a comment about this story from the IDF. On January 31, 2016, an email was sent to the IDF asking the following questions:A. As part of the IDF investigation into the death of Toveet Radcliffe, did the IDF utilize the services of a scene expert? If the IDF did in fact utilize the services of a scene expert, what did the scene expert conclude was the firing angle of the rifle used to kill Toveet Radcliffe? And how did the scene expert explain it would have been physically possible (not to mention logically sensible) for Toveet Radcliffe to have fired a bullet from that firing angle?B. The IDF autopsy report mentions that the IDF pathologist found blackish residues that settle with other gunshot byproducts, primarily propellant power particles and soot on the head of Toveet Radcliffe. It does not mention finding any of these residues on either of Toveets hands. Is the lack of residue on either of Toveets hands consistent with the supposition that one of Toveets hands  the left one, in the opinion of the pathologist  held the barrel of the rifle up to her forehead?C. How does the IDF account for the discrepancies in the accounts of the death of Toveet Radcliffe given to her mother Khydijah? If the official IDF report of last week declared that Toveet was found dead in a guard booth and that just one bullet was shot through her head, then why was Khydijah told right after Toveets death that Toveet was found dead in her assigned bed, and that not one but two bullets were shot through her head?On February 2, 2016, the IDF responded as follows:The Israel Defense Forces empathizes with the sorrow of the bereaved family and will continue to accompany them. Regarding the circumstances of the death of Toveet Radcliffe of blessed memory, a thorough and comprehensive investigation was carried out. After closely examining the investigation materials, the Military Attorney General gave their opinion. All of the investigation materials have been made available to the family, including the opinion. If the family has questions regarding the information that has been transferred to them, or has requests for additional information, they will be answered in full, directly to the family.Khydijah saidshe has yet to receive any investigation materials from the army, other than the pathologist report and the military attorney generals opinion                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Baton Rouge Food Bank Fund,"$1,075","$2,000",Charity," August 20, 2016",22,1,MILTON,FL,144000,1,1,"                            Charlotte Payne                                                                                                                   MILTON, FL                                                        We are raising funds for victims of the flood.

At the time, I had no idea what I was going to do. After owning my first 5 baby goats and some brief exposure to rescue, I knew I wanted to work in farm animal rescue. Leaving a great job in the city to pursue my philanthropic endeavors was scary, but I've never been happier. Over the last year and a half, I have aquired 15 goats and a few other farm animal family members. The last 9 goats were either sick, neglected, abused or deformed and all had special needs. 8 of them were babies. I feel a special calling to baby goats with special needs. I want to take the worst cases... the ones I know will not survive without me. Many baby goats with special needs are born on meat or dairy farms and are euthanized because it is simply too costly and time consuming to care for them. I want to give as many of those babies as possible a chance. I also want to continue to document their journeysof rehabilitation andhealing to show everyone that they are worth saving. They have just as much of a right to live as anyone else. I am in the process of moving to a new home with more land to accomodate my rescue. I am building a barn and fencing in a large wooded area where I plan to create an Enchanted Goat Forest for all of the rescue goats to enjoy. There will be treehouses, bouncy bridges, platforms and toys throughout the trees. I will have a special needs baby area that is fun but safe for the new babies andgoats with long term disabilities. I recently set up Goats of Anarchy, Inc. and I have officially filed for my 501c3. I am now able to take tax-deductible donations! The non-profit status will be retroactive for this year! This is probably the most expensive time period for the GOA Rescue because we are moving and building our new rescue barn and facility. I am still a few thousand short to cover fencing and construction materials and my vet bills have been extremely high due to surgeries this month. Please consider donating toward thecare of our current and future baby goats. This is a forever home and our baby goats will live out the rest of their lives with us.

I never spent a day deployed in combat, but I have had many friends who have, some of which who have been severely impacted and one who never made it back. I recently reconnected with one of my brothers, Brian Romans from 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion (1st LAR Bn). After a few deployments Brian was medically retired with PTSD from the USMC. He has started a 501(c)(3)) charity named Romans Warrior foundation (RWF)  http://www.romanswarriorfoundation.com/ RWF supports Veterans, First Responders and Gold Star Families. Within in 20 minutes of reconnecting, it was a no brainer that I had to do something to help my brother. I have ridden my bike and ran all over gods creation, even stayed up for 24 hours humping a ruck sack to raise money for various charitable causes. Well, now I have an opportunity to help one of my own. My wife and I decided to ride our bike's (bicycle) from the Marine Corps Museum in Quantico Virginia to the Marine Corps Base Camp LeJeune, North Carolina (342 miles) to raise awareness for Veterans causes and raise funding for RWF The ultimate goal of RWF is to buy a lodge where we can send families to at no cost to them. The ride will start September 16th at 0600 at the Marine Corps Museum. The ride will end around 1600 on September18th at Camp Lejeune. I am hoping to end at 2nd LAR.....HINT, HINT (let's make that happen fellas).It will be farthest either of us have ridden in consecutive days, because we all have to keep pushing ourselves. We accomplished many physically and mentally challenging events in my life, but this will likely be one of the most memorable. All the veterans out there struggling need to keep fighting and I am hoping to give them some inspiration. My super awesome, bad ass wife and I will be our own support crew / convoy commander, carrying anything we may need along the way in our C2 vehicle (AKA: GMC Truck). She did not even blink an eye when I asked her about supporting this event. I will be stopping at night. Locations to be posted later. We will be tracking our progress along the route real time via live GPS. You can log in and check my progress, catch up say hello, ride along for awhile, shoot the shit, challenge me to a race, waive some flags, or whatever motivates you. The louder you cheer the faster we will ride. If you are at my end of day checkpoint beer is always welcome. So that is my story. Honest, sincere and blunt. I am helping a brother, because that is what Marines do, we do not have to be told, or asked, we just do it, because you fight for the guys next to you.

Taking an opportunity to teach, I drove past the building where I can usually find him, and there he was, huddled between the pillars again, all of his belongings around him and under him. I slowed down and explained ""there's where he sleeps, every night, just right there on the ground,"" and Domenic let out an involuntary ""aww"". I continued to explain how he goes from one shelter to another where he may find a meal, and sometimes a bathroom to try and clean up. ""Doesn't he have money?"" Domenic asked, and I explained that he gets only $780 from the government each month, and he has to use that all month long to take care of the basics of living. ""Can't he use that money for a house?"" he asked, and I explained that even the most inexpensive flophouse hotel would cost him $30 per day, which would leave him with no money for anything else in his life - no food, water, clothes, etc. - and he would have to rely on handouts and hand ups just to barely survive. It became more difficult for him to understand as I talked about how $30 a day might seem like a lot of money to a 12 year old, but that there are people out there who are working two and three jobs, earning $100 per day who still are barely scraping by. He was quiet for the rest of the ride home, and I thought that's where it would end for him, a sad lesson about the poor in America.The following morning, as we were taking care of breakfast, he asked ""Daddy, do we still have those old LEGOs you said I needed to give away so that I could get some new sets for my birthday?"" I answered ""Yes, they're still out on the porch so we can get them to Cradles to Crayons. Why?"" He responded ""I'd really like to sell them - how much could I get for them?"" I told him that they probably wouldn't sell for too much, and asked him why he wanted to sell them instead of donating them. His answer took me close to tears:""I want to take the money and give it all to that man on the ground. It'll do him a lot more good than if I just give them away. No one should have to sleep on the ground.""I told him that was a great idea, and that I'm sure he would appreciate it, but that it probably wouldn't be as much help as he thought. Then, as children sometimes do, he took the chance to teach me, with a sentiment I had explained to him a long time before.""You always say that one thin dime can't do any damage, but if I stack up 1000 dimes, I can smash a window or break bones, and that means change starts with one and the more you add to it, the more damage you can do, right? Hey, guess what? I have a cool idea ... what if I actually DID stack up a thousand dimes? Or more even? That would help, right? We could call it 'Dom's Dimes'! That would be awesome, right? Can I do that? How would I do that?""Yes. Yes, you can. Yes, we can.So, weare creating a charitable enterprise to assist the homeless and calling it ""DOM'S DIMES"". While in person we are collecting dimes from people, the larger idea is for us to begin the process of collecting contributions of all kinds. The symbolism of the dime is important - one dime is hardly anything, but thousands combined can put a serious dent in an all too large problem in this community and this country.If you have questions about how to give, just message or post here,or visit our Facebook page at  www.facebook.com/domsdimes10.

Riding requires total focus, situational awareness, keeps your head on a swivel. When we ride, many of the things that weigh so heavily on our minds slip away for a moment, permitting us to concentrate on the riding. After the ride is over, we may find the clarity to focus on other challenges and sometimes find pathways to solutions.Every day, twenty-two Veterans kill themselves. Many Vets need something to hang on to, a group of fellow warriors with whom they can relate, a reason to stick around. Camaraderie is critical to the mental health of Vets. Introducing Vets to motorcycling, and CVMA, is one way to establish a long-lasting relationship with a healthy sport and like-minded fellow vets.Since World War II, Veterans have gravitated towards motorcycling as a means to foster camaraderie and experience the freedom of the open road. Motorcyclists around the world recognize the therapeutic value of riding  operation of a motorcycle requires a singular focus, thereby blocking out almost everything else while riding.We have developed this program to increase a sense of personal value and decrease suicides by locating serviceable starter motorcycles to donate to veterans, facilitate training opportunities, providing protective clothing and insurance for one year. If, at the end of the year, the Veteran has become proficient in basic motorcycle operation, participated in group activities with fellow Veteran-motorcyclists and decided to stick around for themselves, their families and their comrades, title to the motorcycle will pass to them.We are looking for suitable candidates for our program and used-but-serviceable motorcycles as well as money.If you know of a Veteran who would benefit from this program, or of a motorcycle, sitting alone and unloved, please let us know.All donations are tax deductible.Thanks for reading this and please consider supporting our program.                                                                                            + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Cancer Support Community/V/V/SB,"$3,185","$500,000",Charity," July 26, 2016",26,2,WESTLAKE VILLAGE,CA,381000,,3,"                            Csc Valleyvsb                                                                                                                   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CA                                ""My family gave me the reason to fight cancer, my doctors gave me the ability to beat it, and Cancer Support Community gave me the hope to get through it."" ---Dale, Survivor of esophageal cancerProviding Free Support for Anyone Affected by Cancer Help us achieve our fundraising goal of 2.5 million dollars to keep Hope Alive for Another 25!

There's a home he found that he needs funds to rent and work on it, so that the children he helps could have a place to live.My names are Turyatunga Felex. I am 23 years old from Uganda Africa. I was born in a polygamous family where my daddy had over 14 children and 4 wives.  I was 4 years old when my dad abandoned us and left us alone with our mother, with no one to help. Our mother had no money to take me to school and to feed us. Our Dad would come home for only mistreating us and fighting with our mother.  Everyday life was a mess. Our mother tried her level best and made me study and completed primary school and all in my pain. At school I could study for one week and the school directors could send me back to home for fees and with nowhere to get it I would have to spend some weeks home looking for fees myself but all in pain and when I was completing my primary six level our mother also left us alone because of my dad afflictions toward her. I lost everything and everyone at that moment I was left homeless. I had to look for where to get survival from. I went to the streets of Kampala where I start life from. When on street life was not easy at all. I had nowhere to stay, I had nothing to eat and with nothing to put on. I could move into hotel pits to get what to eat but all in vain it was a hell. While on street God was merciful to me and saved me from the pits when I accepted Jesus as my personal savior, from then on I started believing God and I start hoping in him that one day my life will change.  I started sleeping in church but with nothing to eat. From there God was merciful to me and brought one who was merciful to me sponsoring me in school again he paid for only one term, because I was bright the school gave me bursary till I finished high school. After high school I had no one to take me to the university so I went to church again and I start ministering. I also sleep in church when every one had left. I loved helping others whom I met on the streets. I could go there and preach to them. God taught me many things. I learnt his word, I joined a missions team called gospel tour ministry., and we started moving to the villages helping those in need and the poor as we pray and preach to them. I am setting up an orphanage home to help kids who are on the street, who are in diaspora like I was in. Those who lost parental love and care so that they can have the care and love lost from their parents. I sponsor them in schools as well.

By morning, the 150 year old sanctuary lay in ashes. It was only thanks to the heroic efforts of the Englewood fire department as well as firefighters from surrounding towns that the adjacent building, which houses our beloved Pre-School and Kindergarten, was saved. Our relief, however, was short lived. The extent of the smoke damage sustained by our entire building - from the library, to the classrooms, to the gym - has proven to be beyond remediation. The good news is that the school remains structurally sound and we will be able to welcome our students back before the end of the school year. The heartbreaking news is that everything within those walls has to be discarded. We have lost all our art supplies and alphabet blocks, furniture and play fruit, Legos and Lincoln Logs, our computers. We have lost every single book in our library.While The Church's insurance will reimburse the cost of the most basic needs of our school, we cannot hope to reestablish the depth of our offerings and curriculum without your help.

This is Megan of Banding Together. I am so excited to present you with our 1st Go Fund Me online fundraiser! As many of you know, Banding Togethers mission is to spread awareness about the realness of sex trafficking right here in Oregon and provide financial support for local survivors of sexual exploitation. Similar to our past fundraisers, this one is directed at providing support for a specific area of need. For more information on our efforts to #endit and #dosomething check out our Facebook page.  www.facebook.com/BandingTogetherEventsEarlier this year I had the pleasure of meeting local survivor, Andrea. Former victim turned survivor, she now advocates on many platforms to take a stand against sex trafficking. Among these platforms she sits on the board of directors for Deceptions, a youth directed curriculum series that educates on the dangers of sex trafficking. This year, she has appeared in several local news stories sharing her personal story of survival of being trafficked. She has also worked on an upcoming project through the NoVo foundation highlighting survivors stories. I am honored to call her a friend.The road for a survivor is a tough one and Andrea feels fortunate to be apart of an awesome support group called ""Thrivers"". The group consists of 10 young women who are all survivors of sexual exploitation. Every couple weeks they meet at a beautiful ranch property outside the city to learn new skills, ride horses, tend a garden, bond new friendships, explore arts and crafts, live in the moment and be empowered.Recently, Andrea came to me with a desire to provide her fellow Thrivers with self-defense tools. She herself, was gifted several Damsel in Defense tools that have empowered her, helped to ease anxiety and created a sense of true protection. Andreas hope was that Damsel in Defense could donate enough products to empower each woman in her group. Unfortunately, being new to the Damsel in Defense mission, I personally do not have the means to donate enough product to equip each and every one of them. However, as Banding Togethers Creator/Director I do have the means and resources to reach people who have giving hearts. THATS WHERE YOU COME IN!Everyone deserves the right to protect themselves, please consider a donation today!Our goal is to reach $1,100 in just 10 days. This will cover all fees and provides all 10 ""Thrivers""with one of each of the following tools: Stun Gun, Pepper Spray, Kubotan, Keychain Alarm and Door Alarm! Although we will not be sharing additional names, each and every one of these young women has her own story of survival, fights her own battles daily, strives to overcome personal struggles and would benefit in more ways that words can describe from your donations!I'll never forget the day that I found out the man who trafficked me was about to be released from prison. I didn't feel ready; my house wasn't safe, my job didn't have security cameras, and I never took that self defense class I had planned to take. After expressing my fears and concerns a friend and advocate gave me a stun gun, door alarm, and pepper spray from Damsel. I felt SO empowered. My trafficker showed up at my gym, AND my job. But I had a plan for if he came near me. I felt safe, empowered, and ready to protect myself! Almost a year later, my home and job are much more protected in other ways, but I feel safe walking from my car to the front door every single day because of my stun gun and pepper spray. I feel safe when I have to stay at a hotel because of my door stop! And I feel empowered and encouraged by the strong women that surround me.  -Andrea BensonThank you in advance for each and every ounce of support you have shown and continue to show for our #dosomething efforts!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Storytelling for Border Convergence,$580,$900,Charity," September 23, 2016",7,2,LEXINGTON,KY,26000,,,"                            Steve Pavey                                                                                                                   LEXINGTON, KY                                                        Im heading out for a three-week solidarity road trip to the US/Mexico Border Convergence from October 7-10.

It looked like a pretty mild colic, but we had our vet out and he was given fluids orally to help with mild dehydration. On Friday, it looked like he was recovering but at 2:30 pm he started acting painful again. Under our vets recommendation we brought Cool Man to A&M for IV fluids. We truely hoped that this would be an easy resolution. But that is not to be. Cool Man's impaction is far worse than we had thought. He will be staying at A&M to receive more fluids via IVand orally until they feel that he is no longer impacted.

First off I will explain as briefly as possible what I am trying to do. In just Miami Dade animal shelter they put down more than 10, 000 animals a year... this is horrifying. And many of these dogs are perfectly fine. And by perfectly fine... I mean little fuzzy angels from Heaven. Ok...this is where it needs more detail.    I grew up in a home surrounded by dogs. My mom tried to save every stray she could and rehome them. So needless to say my affection grew as I grew up. Well fast forward a few years. I deployed as a Marine during 2003 for the invasion into Iraq. Shortly after coming home I had trouble and some dark days. Luckily for me I wasnt alone. I had a Chihuahua named Titus and he was my best bud.  But between work and school I was gone a lot and didnt like leaving him alone. I decided he needed a buddy. I looked high and low at shelters for the perfect dog. My girlfriend at the time found a little puppy in Gainesville Florida. Apparently someone found a black lab walking on the side of the highway. She was picked up and taken home. The person who found her happened to be a vet and took her home and got her healthy. Shortly after she gave birth to 4 Australian cattle dog/lab mixes.  We ended up taking one home. She was the goofy runt chasing her tail in circles instead of playing with the other dogs. So fast track a little bit.... we named her Kansas and she came to live with Titus and I. Well this girl is amazing. I can fake it with the best of them pretending not to be sad. But she could see right through it and would cover me with kisses and never leave my side when I was down. On my darkest days she got me through. I can honestly say I am alive now because of her. And now I am married with a son. I wouldnt be here and neither would my son have come into this world if it wasnt for her.  Since then I have rescued and brought home more than a dozen dogs. Getting them healthy and rehoming them. Unfortunately I live in a townhouse and space is limited. Not to mention half the time the dogs I bring home end up getting my own dogs sick.     One of the dogs I brought home I affectionately names Chaos. Because well.... everything that could go wrong did go wrong. I didnt know there were even that many types of worms that dogs could have!!!  He happened to come into our life the same time I broke my ankle. It was bad, 2 surgeries and months of bed rest. Well little Chaos was there next to me the entire time. After that.... there was no way I was giving him up. I am so glad I kept him. He is the best big brother to my son. He never ever lets him out of his sight. Doesnt matter who is holding him, where he is, or what time it is. A 3 am feeding... Chaos is there... a 2 pm bath... Chaos is there.  I honestly feel safer having Chaos at home when I am working long shifts at the hospital.  He keeps my family safe.   So here is why I am on here... I need space and a building to do what my heart desires. I have lost way, way, way too many brothers from the Military to the darkness within. I want to save them. And dogs can help. Even an untrained dog(normal pet) helps kids with special needs and adults with ptsd through. There are 1000 studies out there.  Well I want to save the dogs and use them to help save people. I luckily have friends who are professional dog trainers and I am not half bad myself. I want to pull the working breeds out of the high kill shelters and work with them and be able to provide a companion matched toveterans with PTSD or to kids with special needs.  I am here because of a 4 legged angel and I want others to be here as well. This last week I lost a friend from elementary and middle school. He served in the Marines as well. I didnt know him when he was in but we caught up years later. He decided this week to give up his fight. He leaves a devastated girlfriend and her daughter behind. I want to stop seeing that happen. The VA wont recognize dogs as treatment for PTSD. They think that they can throw enough medication at a person to numb them and send them home. And you all see the statistics... how many people commit suicide every day. Obviously their way doesnt work. This is my life long goal. I dont care if it takes forever to do this... I will do this.  And the reason I am asking for so much money is because I want to do this for real. I want a couple acres and a legitimate building to house and train these dogs in. If I could have afforded this alone I would have a long long time ago. And sadly around me land isnt too cheap(south Florida). So if you can donate even a single dollar... please do. Until I can do this for real I am still going to bring home every stray and dog in need I can and do what I can no matter how little. I just hope one day I can save them all. I know, I know. I cant. But that wont stop me from trying.  If you made it through all of this... Thank youJoshua+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"Ryan Smith Foundation Snowdon Shove,,,Charity," June 3, 2016",73,3,Bracebridge Ward,ENG,238000,1,6,"                            Jeannie Bee                                                                                                                   Bracebridge Ward, ENG                                On 22nd July 2013, Ryan Smith suffered severe brain injuries in a cycling accident. He was struck by a van on a narrow road in Lincolnshire. This accident could not have been avoided, however, Ryans brain injuries could have been lessened if he had been wearing his helmet. Ryan didnt want to mess up his hair. As a result of this fateful day Ryan is now confined to a wheelchair and is still receiving therapy for his injuries. He now requires constant care from his family, friends and carers.To raise awareness of Ryan's plight, Mark, Ryan's dad set up the Ryan Smith Foundation in order to educate and protect those cycling. Monies raised will be used to fund the Foundation's extensive education program, which has already included visiting over 100 schools across the country to raise awareness of the importance in wearing a cycle helmet. The education team work with children to raise awareness, and supply helmets to as many people as they can. Kids need lids!The Foundation also supports other families suffering the same fate, financially supporting them, offering a listening ear, and support when needed. This includes regular contact, sharing experiences and helping one another.Monies raised also go towards helping Ryan himself in order to provide him with everything he needs to improve and recover. To date, the Foundation have secured him a specialised bicycle, hydrotherapy pool and equipment. As time goes by Ryan, will continue to need more support, so we raise monies to help him as much as we can.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help Save Baby's Leg!! ,"$3,380","$3,000",Charity," July 16, 2013",56,38,EAST ROCKAWAY,NY,235000,,11,"                            Kimberly Dana                                                            for FUR BABIES RESCUE AND REFERRAL INCEAST ROCKAWAY, NY                                                        Baby is a 2 yr old female 60 lb lab mix.

We have a number of deep concerns about this contract. * What are the financial risks to the FPB, its customers, and the KyMEAs other members from committing to a ten year contract for coal power (a contract that will run through 2029)? In this time of dynamic change in the energy sector and with a host of significant environmental regulations coming to bear upon coal power plants, we question the wisdom of making such long-term commitments to coal power. *Are there provisions within the contract that could become barriers to energy efficiency programs and renewable energy development? Energy efficiency and renewable energy offer many benefits to Frankfort and the KyMEAs other member communities. As energy efficiency is already the least-cost energy resource and the cost of renewables has been declining consistently for decades, we fear that this contract will lock the FPB into a power supply that undercuts their ability to pursue better, less costly options.As the KyMEA is a new statewide agency with municipal-utility members from across the state, we believe this research has statewide significance. Nine municipal utilities are All-Requirements members of the KyMEA and have signed the same contract. We hope that the results of our research will be to the benefit of each of these members and their communities, in addition to the Frankfort Plant Board.The funding we seek will enable us to hire consultants to analyze the contract and offer us their assessment and recommendations. The results of their analysis will guide our next steps as we work to move Frankfort towards a more sustainable energy system.EnvisionFranklinCounty promotes a healthy, beautiful, and thriving community and encourages development that results in good relationships among people, the land and future generations.The Kentucky Conservation Foundation is the educational sponsor for the work of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, one of thelongest-running conservation advocacy organizations in Kentucky.KCF supports powerful and innovative programs to build capacity in Kentucky for communities building a cleaner and more sustainable future.Donations may be mailed to: Kentucky Conservation Foundation, PO Box 1152, Frankfort, KY 40602.Please make checks payable to Kentucky Conservation Foundation and note the contribution is to support the EnvisionFranklinCounty project.

We are Theresa and Joseph, and Our Lady of Pompei Church always has been part of our life. And our pastor, Fr. Lou, who has been at Pompei his entire 50 years of priesthood, has been part of our life too.One church. One priest. Many generations. Let us explain. Fr. Lou married Joseph'sparents, gave usall oursacraments, including marriage, and baptized our children. Our story is not unlike others in our parish. Built by Italian-American immigrants, the church property extends an entireblock consisting of the church, the convent, the gymnasium, and the school. For 92 years, the church has been an anchor for Highlandtown. Our Lady of Pompei and Fr. Lou have been part of many generations of families! We want to continue that tradition.Once a thriving congregation with a parish school, like many city churches, people started to disappear over the years. Children of parishioners moved away, urbanflight in the 1990s left empty pews, and in the 2012the school was moved to another location.Now our church is in a rebuilding phase. Like the early years of ministering to Italian immigrants, Our Lady of Pompei continues to embrace immigrants settling in Highlandtown today, the Sunday School enrollment increases each year, and we are hoping to reach younger adults living in the area. Our outlook for Pompei is positive. But it needsa financial jump start to helpprovide a permanent place for faith formation, outreach, and church and community activities. The biggest financial burden was the empty school building, which has beensold. Subsequently, our soup kitchen has been closed until we can relocate/build a kitchen in a new area.The funds from the sale of the school are building are accessible as needed. And the primary use of those funds, are for normal, ongoing expenses. We still rely on loans or generosity of supporters to help with our bigger plans of rehabilitating our buildings for community use. As parishioners, we had the idea to create thisonline campaign tostrengthen Pompei's' financial health and boost its rebuilding efforts.  All donations collected will be given to Our Lady of Pompei to benefit the Building Fund, which helps defray the cost of the repair and remodeling work needed. Joinour endeavor to rebuildOur Lady of Pompei for future generations. Every donation will help. and will be greatly appreciated. No donation is too small. If you live in the area, consider the gift of continual support - join the church, attend weekly Mass, and get involved!Check out our church's Facebook page and website. www.facebook.com/PompeiBaltimore www.olpmd.orgOn the 1st of each month, GoFundMe will cut a check directly to Our Lady of Pompei. A brief history of Our Lady of PompeiIn 1923, the Vincentian fathers founded Our Lady of Pompei as a mission to the Italian immigrant community of Highlandtown.  The church was built by the hard, dedicated workof Italian immigrants. In the early 1990s, the Vincentian Fathers left and Fr. Lou decided to remain under the Archdiocese of Baltimore. One parishioner recounts, If he didnt stay when the Vincentian priests left, I dont think we would have had a parish"". In 2014, Fr. Lou celebrated his 50th anniversary of priesthood spent entirely at Our Lady of Pompei! Fr. Lou has provided so much for the church and the community!About Joseph & TheresaJoseph and Theresa continue to be active in their parish. Joseph is an usher, Theresa, sings in the choir, and both are members of the Parish Council.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Philippines Social Entrepreneurship,"$1,365","$2,500",Charity," June 6, 2016",16,3,PALO ALTO,CA,247000,,2,"                            Shayna Hofmann                                                                                                                   PALO ALTO, CA                                                        We are a group of students associated with Foothill College in Los Altos, California.

Our goal is to raise $2,500 that will be used to create a composting system designed to help reduce the amount of foliage on the property while the organic substances produced will be used as fertilizer for Calintaan's mango orchard. This project implemented along with the two additional projects will be collectively used to provide an exceptional educational experience and provide Calintaan with the financial means to continue to advance as an institution while also serving the greater local community. Your donation will be greatly appreciated and will improve the livelihoods of countless youth attending Calintaan National High School. Our team believes in the value of partial solutions and by working one-on-one with Calintaan National High School and the surrounding community we can address social and economic issues while preserving the dynamic in the community. Incorporating educational institutions, social entrepreneurs, and surrounding villages to become collectively self-sustaining, we can provide the foundation for a better brighter future.

We are a group of high school teenagers from Atlanta, Georgia. Four years ago, one of our families adopted a little girl from Xinyang Childrens Welfare Institute in China. Through recent contact with the orphanage, they found out that the orphanage is short ofsome much-needed supplies. This inspired our charity project, Bring Smiles To Orphans (BSTO). With the help of our parents, we created a nonprofit organization called Hearts2Hearts Childrens Foundation, whose mission is to raise funds and awareness for Chinese orphansin a more systematic and consistent way,and BSTO isour first kickoff project! What is Bring Smiles To Orphans?Xinyang Childrens Welfare Institute is located at the mid-south in Henan, an inland province in China. The institute has 160+ children and most of them are handicapped in some way. Our projects purpose is to support these unfortunate kids in any way we can. The orphanage is in need of the following items: Paper diapersBaby formula Winter jackets and winter accessories  Shoes Blankets/comfortersOur goal is to raise $4,000 to purchase these items. We plan to visit the Xinyang Orphanage and hand-deliver them over this winter break. This trip will be completely self-funded, so all funds raised will go towards buying the supplies. While we are there, we will also volunteer at the orphanage and playing with the children. We look forward to kicking off 2017 with these precious children and seeing big smiles on their little faces!Mother Theresa once said, The needs are great, and none of us, including me, ever do great things. But we can all do small things, with great love, and together we can do something wonderful. We cannot accomplish our goal without your help and support. Together we can do something extraordinary! Every bit raised will go to serving these children and will make a positive impact on their lives, from much needed baby supplies to warm winter clothes to lots of colorful toys and books.

We are a group of high school teenagers from Atlanta, Georgia. Four years ago, one of our families adopted a little girl from Xinyang Childrens Welfare Institute in China. Through recent contact with the orphanage, they found out that the orphanage is short ofsome much-needed supplies. This inspired our charity project, Bring Smiles To Orphans (BSTO). With the help of our parents, we created a nonprofit organization called Hearts2Hearts Childrens Foundation, whose mission is to raise funds and awareness for Chinese orphansin a more systematic and consistent way,and BSTO isour first kickoff project! What is Bring Smiles To Orphans?Xinyang Childrens Welfare Institute is located at the mid-south in Henan, an inland province in China. The institute has 160+ children and most of them are handicapped in some way. Our projects purpose is to support these unfortunate kids in any way we can. The orphanage is in need of the following items: Paper diapersBaby formula Winter jackets and winter accessories  Shoes Blankets/comfortersOur goal is to raise $4,000 to purchase these items. We plan to visit the Xinyang Orphanage and hand-deliver them over this winter break. This trip will be completely self-funded, so all funds raised will go towards buying the supplies. While we are there, we will also volunteer at the orphanage and playing with the children. We look forward to kicking off 2017 with these precious children and seeing big smiles on their little faces!Mother Theresa once said, The needs are great, and none of us, including me, ever do great things. But we can all do small things, with great love, and together we can do something wonderful. We cannot accomplish our goal without your help and support. Together we can do something extraordinary! Every bit raised will go to serving these children and will make a positive impact on their lives, from much needed baby supplies to warm winter clothes to lots of colorful toys and books.

In the Oakland/Genesse County, MI area we are organizing a supply run to deliver out to North Dakota to those that are currently offering themselves in service to protect our water. An urgent call to support the Standing Rock pipeline protest camps in Cannonball, North Dakota. This Standing Rock Sioux reservation with support from other nations has successfully halted construction of the 3.7 billion dollar Dakota Access Pipeline LLC project. The proposed pipeline is 1,170 miles long and would deliver 570,000 barrels of Bakken crude oil per day. This pipeline would extend through 4 states (North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois) and 50 counties, crossing under the Missouri River twice, and over connected waterways 7 times. A broken oil pipeline would be disastrous for the water supply for Stand https://www.facebook.com/events/108794959581902/ing Rock Reservation. It would also be hazardous for the entire downstream Missouri River ecosystem that could threaten water supplies of other first nations reservations, farming communities, and many native plant and animal species. Clean water for over 10 million people would be at risk. Sadly, there have already been numerous pipeline ruptures in the last few years, this link offers more information into the magnitude and frequency of these disasters...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pipeline_accidents_in_the_United_States_in_the_21st_century The first nation communities are not just standing up for the water in their area, they are standing up for it for the world. They are there to protect the waters for the next generation, which includes your children and grandchildren. More people are arriving at Standing Rock every day, and they are committed to staying for as long as it takes. A medicine woman once said that there will come a day when the price of water is higher than the price of oil, it saddens me to feel the imminence of this truth, yet let us not allow the weight of the world to get us down, let us instead do what we can to heal it. Our goal is to have the truck rented, loaded with supplies and on the road to North Dakota by Sept 27th, which is a week today. This means that action needs to happen NOW, and this is where you come in :-) How you can help: * If you are local to the area, we are looking for donations of the following items: Generators, camping gear, tents, sleeping bags, sweatshirts and sweatpants (M,L,XL), gloves, socks, lanterns, batteries, tarps, tables, chairs, canopies, propane, solar showers, cots, ropes, towels, wood 2x4s, plywood, nails, hammers, axes, chainsaws and equipment, food compost bins, big tent for kids, hand crank washing machine, school supplies, kids chairs for school, carpeting for school, chalk board, medical supplies, non-perishable food, water. * You can share this information as far and wide as possible, if each person that this was sent to forwarded this message to even 10 other people it would have a huge impact. * You can direct people to, and invite them to the facebook group here..  https://www.facebook.com/events/108794959581902/ *Speak to your friends/family etc....so many of us have so much stuff in the attic or garage that is sat collecting dust, why not put it to good use? *DONATE! The estimated costs to get the truck out there with rental and gas are approximately $2000, Any extra money raised goes towards buying extra supplies, food water etc. The goal s to raise $5000 in the next week.

He had made it over 700 miles, from MA to the woods of Wendell, NC. His ride taught us to make the most out of our lives. And on Sept. 19 the ride continues with his son Ryan, pedaling alongside his wife Amy as they head down the East Coast.

As you can see in the picture, the current volleyball court needs improvement. The length and width of the court sand is about 10 feet too short on each side, which could cause injuries. And, if someone passes the ball incorrectly, it could go over the edge of the creek wall and into the water below. Once the court is up to playing standards, kids in the neighborhood will have access to the great outdoor sport of beach volleyball. There might be the nextKerri Walsh Jennings /April Ross orPhil Dalhausser /Nick Lucena team out there just waiting for the chance to try out the sport. Kids 12 and older are usually inside playing video games or watching TV. Easy access to an outdoor court would give them a chance to work on their skills and learn by watching others in the community play. Coaches can be brought in to teach skills and strategiesPlano is home to many club-level volleyball teams and many of these young people are interested in playing sand volleyball. Beach Volleyball is the fastest growing sport in NCAA history with 60 teams currently and growing every year. Few kids in the area have access to a decent outdoor court and my plan can help them learn and get exercise by playing a great sport that doesn't have a lot of injuries.I would also like to get a sponsor like Wilson to provide volleyballs to each kid that comes out to a clinic to practice with at their home. The Texas Pool Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so all of the contributions to this fund are tax deductible.

I currently work at Devereux Georgia in the capacity of Case Coordinator in the Foster Care Specialty Unit. Devereux Georgia provides new hopes, new dreams, and new choices for children adolescents and young adults struggling with emotional and behavioral health challenges. Devereux Georgia is part of The Devereux Foundation, which has been providing treatment, education and vocational services for more than 100 years. , Because of this experience, my compassion led me to start a non-profit called MeMe's House, named after my grandmother. MeMe's House mission is to teach young men how to understand, function and excel in today's society by receiving a culmination of skills, experiences and opportunities. Our vision aims to guide male youth towards a new perspective regarding manhood, social responsibility and personal development. I love helping young men follow their dreams and aspirations. My goal is to incorporate Meme's House mission in Atlanta Public Schools. The purpose of this account is to help fund Meme's House. Your donations will go towards interactive websites, social media, books, guest speakers, field trips, games, fine arts, inclusion activities and projects, transportation and more. I would like to THANK YOU in advance for not only donating to a wonderful cause to help our young men of the future, but also taking the time to read about my dream. Thank you again and have a great day. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Power to the Period - San Antonio,$425,"$1,000",Charity," September 19, 2016",10,6,SAN ANTONIO,TX,56000,,1,"                            Sydney Wright                                                                                                                   SAN ANTONIO, TX                                According to the 2015 Point In Time homelessness count, approximately 2,891 people are living without a home or are on the streets in San Antonio any given day. Many in this situation have extremely limited access to period products (pads, tampons, liners, etc.) each month. In fact, period products are some of the most needed items in homeless shelters across the country.This San Antonio reigional Power to the Period campaign was developed by apassionate Trinity University grad named Sydney Wright in an effort to find a way of engaging our city to collectively help a women's issue that is often not discussed. 100% of the proceeds on this page will be used to purchase a variety of period productsto be donated to a local San Antonio homeless shelter on Sept. 30th.Our local shelter affiliated with Power to the Period is:San Antonio Rescue Mission907 E Quincy Ave, San Antonio, TX 78212(if we go beyond our goal, we will spreadthe products amongst another local shelter of choice as well)There are only 6-DAYS left in the campaign (donating on Sept. 30th), so let's make an impact!As a part of the national Power to the Period campaign by DoSomething.org and U by Kotex, we will demonstrate that San Antonio cares about our homeless population, and that we are an active part of the FIRST EVER national period product drive. Watch the national campaign PSAhere.Together, our efforts help ensure that people in shelters have consistent access to the items they need.*** Note: There is also a chance that if our city was able to donate the most products out of the national campaign, we could be in the running for a $5,000 scholarship. We decided against officially shooting for this or promoting it as a driving factor because other participants have been collecting items for weeks already. But, if we were to win the competition, we would then work with several area organizations and school districts to gift this scholarship to a selected local homeless or low-income Senior in high schoolto attendcollege upon graduation. ***                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"supplying relief to Haiti,"$3,073","$250,000",Charity," June 21, 2016",67,3,PHILADELPHIA,PA,194000,,8,"                            Angelina St Jean-Prunier                                                                                                                   PHILADELPHIA, PA                                                        My name is Angelina. My husband and I were born in Haiti. We have seven beautiful children. I came to America in 1985. I went to Haiti for the first time in 2006 because I was invited to a wedding. My experience there was very choking especially in the country part of Provot Grand Cayes, Anse-a-beau, Haiti. I found that one of my nieces I met for the first time was very sick. She had an ear infection. She had a thick liquid coming down from her ears with a foul smell. Her little was over two years old but didn't even crawl yet because of malnutrition. And than I saw other children as well as adults who were also in terrible conditions. At that very moment I realized how blessed I was to have been in America. Since then I tried so hard to help as much as I can providing food, shelter, school supplies, clothing, paying school fees, etc. But I come to the point of realizing that this is much bigger than I am able to handle on my own. I'm asking your help in various areas.1. Build the road2. Build a clinic or a hospital 3. Build schools 4. Dig a wellIn March 2015 I lost my uncle because there wasn't any hospital near and there aren't any roads to get him to one. Shortly after a 27 years male (Junior) died. His diagnosis, a belly ache. They could not get him to a hospital fast enough. As a result he lost his life. Others have died in their beds for numerous reasons. Children are being stayed home because parents cannot afford to send them to school. And school is so far away that parents can't afford shelter out of that town. The distance to get water is miles and miles away. Imagine if you weren't so blessed to be where you are right now. Perhaps you were one of those people in that little town of Provot Grand Cayes. And you were in desperate need of having one, two, maybe a handful of people who cared enough. Oh the difference that would make. All it takes is a decision. Putting your life in another person shoe just once.So I ask you to please help me in this journey to help make a difference in the lives of those unfortunate people of Provot Grand Cayes, Anse-a-veau, Haiti.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"iJog Page Academy - Newport Mesa ,$545,"$5,000",Charity," September 6, 2016",13,19,COSTA MESA,CA,22000,,,"                            James Darin                                                                                                                   COSTA MESA, CA                                PAGE ACADEMY - NEWPORT MESA CAMPUS6th Annual iJog for TechnologyDear Page Families, Friends & Alumni, We are so excited for our sixth annual iJog for Technology fun run!

The third floor of our facility is the vocational floor where members can register for cooking classes, woodworking, or they can learn to sew. Not only are we a walk-in facility, but we also have an after school program and a pre-school program where licensed Early Education & Care teachers are able to provide a safe environment where children can grow and learn. We believe that a good Boys and Girls club provides life-enhancing programs with character development experiences, and faculty that can form caring relationships with our youth. Lastly, we believe that a good club can provide hope and opportunity to each child that walks through our doors. The club serves over 1,000 members of Berkshire County, and your donation will contribute greatly to their future.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help Big Brothers Big Sisters LA ,"$1,359",$12.50,Charity," September 19, 2016",16,5,LOS ANGELES,CA,48000,,1,"                            Sabin Lomac                                                                                                                   LOS ANGELES, CA                                Cousins For A Cause was founded in 2014 when Jim and I realized it was essential for us to give back to the community that has been so good to us. We areexclusively partnered with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles and our mission is to gain more exposure, donations, and volunteers for this amazing foundation. What do we need: Donations. 100% of your donation to Cousins For A Cause will be given to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. Your money will go towards creating more stories like mine; imagine if someone didnt put that ad in the Pennysaver, how different my life would likely be. If not you, who? If not now, when?Let me start from the beginning where my desire to help others was born...I was raised in a single parent home in Southern Maine. While there was a great deal of love in our home, money was scarce and I lacked a male role model. I was a smart, athletic kid at risk of going down the wrong path. I had a rebellious side, I would act out and charm my way out of sticky situations. This behavior eventually landed me in jail where I was faced with the decision of choosing which path I really wanted to take. Around this time (age 14) I had been matched with a Big Brother from the Big Brothers Big Sisters foundation in Portland Maine. My mother knew I needed guidance and after waiting two years on a waitlist, I was matched. His name was Stephen Lacovara, he was 22, and after reading an ad in the local Pennysaver, he decided to volunteer.  For the first time in my life, I had a man in my life that I could confide in, trust, and ask those tough and embarrassing questions. He came to each of my games, which made me feel so good. We talked about girls, school, the trouble I would get in, my goals, my home life, and soon it felt like he was my actual brother, not someone that was matched to me.Long story short, I was the best man in his wedding, he named his son after me, and today (20+ years later) we are closer than ever. Because of his decision to volunteer, my life was forever changed. While I could never repay him for his love and guidance, I can only pay it forward.Both Jim and I are Big Brothers here in LA and we have tons of our friends involved in the program too. I am now a board member for the LA chapter and in 2016 I was awardedthe National Big Brother of the year. Thank you for your generousity, your willingness to help children in our community makes all the differencein their lives.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Help Me Interview a WWII Vet Daily,"$3,070",$18.50,Charity," May 26, 2016",45,4,AGOURA HILLS,CA,166000,,,"                            Rishi Sharma                                                                                                                   AGOURA HILLS, CA                                                        Hello!   My name is Rishi Sharma, I am 18 years old and I run 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called Heroes of the Second World War (heroesofthesecondworldwar.org ) .       My biggest heroes are the combat veterans of World War Two and I am on a mission to try and meet and in-depth film interview as many of these men before it is too late so that I can gain their knowledge and wisdom and also an appreciation for how good I have it. These men are my kindred spirits as they are the only people who I truly enjoy talking to and learning from hours on end. I want them to know how grateful I am for they had to endure and I am trying to be an outlet for them to express their recollections and thoughts of their war days in a censor free environment. The interviews are filmed but there is absolutely no commercial aspect this as I give full rights to the veteran and I burn the DVDs for them. I have been trying very hard to do an interview a day and meeting as many as I can too so that I can absorb as much knowledge and wisdom before it is too late. Because they are dying at such a rapid pace, I have decided to defer school completely after my graduation from HS this past June.                    + Read More"Consciousness in Action,$310,"$10,000",Charity," August 29, 2016",5,27,BRONX,NY,124000,,1,"                            Edward-Yemil Rosario                                                                                                                   BRONX, NY                                                        Hola Everybody, Here I am back again. As some of you know, I have had a challenging time attempting to secure employment in the nonprofit/ industrial complex for the past year. It seems that I am stuck at a Catch-22 that finds me as too qualified for frontline positions, but not qualified enough for management. At least that's been my perception.I was able to find work for about three months, but I was doing the kind of work I felt was reifying the injustices I am dead set at stopping. The work was soul-sucking and each day I went to work, the more hypocritical I felt doing that work. I tried really hard, but some things I could not do. For example, I refused to act as a correctional officer or ""punisher"" in my dealings with incarcerated people. I knew that I would not last, but I tried really hard under unsupportive and demoralizing conditions to stick it through until I was able to find something else. Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, I was terminated.Recently, some friends suggested that I should explore ways to work for myself and in that way, I could perform the types of actions that more closely look like criminal justice reform/ revolution and that is when it hit meI am looking for funds to help the work I am basically doing for free. Essentially, I want to do the following:1. Concentrate on writing for and upgrading my blog.I feel that true social justice reform is in part a form of intellectual engagement in which we try to change the collective mindset that supports the status quo. What this means for me, is countering the punishment paradigm that is at the heart of our current criminal justice crisis.2. Work at assisting in and becoming part of social justice campaigns.Thinking is a form of action, but critical thinking is a subversive action. Action, especially action seeking to lessen (and in some cases, do away with) our pathological dependence on incarceration, is crucial at this moment of our shared history. I have been a part of groups that have created several social justice campaigns. I would use any funds I can get to help assist in some of the campaigns. The closure of Rikers Island and the Beyond Attica campaign, a campaign seeking the closure of the notorious prison as well as calling for the building of society instead of prisons, come to mind. Addressing the plight of the elderly and bringing attention to the destruction of public education in favor of building prisons is what I am most passionate about.In fact, calling myself the Peoples Scholar/ Activist is not merely an affectation. More than anything else, I would like to be a part of something that is a direct response to the people who are most impacted by social policies. Whenever I write, or whenever I am at a campaign meeting, I am thinking of my people. I am thinking, for example, of that mother of two whose husband is being brutalized at Clinton Correctional Facility. I think of the mother of the adolescent whose son or daughter in isolated confinement.I want to amplify those voices through my writing and actions, but this is often difficult within certain organizations. I am not expecting to raise all the funds through the people, but I hope it can be a beginning. I also hope to go to funders who often are reluctant to fund individuals or revolutionary causes.I am also looking to see if I could offer the means wherein people could donate a small sum on a monthly basis, so that burden will be not as onerous.All I can say is that if you want to donate to a cause that is revolutionary in scope but grounded in practicality that you will consider my idea.More on a project plan, complete with outcomes and goals will be forthcoming on my blog.May this find you happy and in good health ,-- EddiePS: You can sample some of my writing at the following link: https://translucence.wordpress.com/+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"PARDONED PETS ANIMAL RESCUE,$630,"$2,285",Charity," February 9, 2016",14,7,ASHLAND,VA,120000,,5,"                            Kathy Ashworth                                                                                                                   ASHLAND, VA                                WE ARE THE VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS.Pardoned Pets Animal Rescue is a small not for profit group of people who rescue the unwanted, abandoned or abused animals in VA and surrounding states.

As of November 2012, there are 58 cases of child abuse and neglect involving 102 kids (slightly more girls than boys) in Boulder County. Royal Family KIDS works with the Colorado Department of Human Services to take these kids to camp and make lasting positive memories.Royal Family KIDS Camp is a one week overnight camp designed for foster children ages 7  11. RFK campers feel loved, safe, special  and this week of positive memories can last a lifetime. These children enjoy just being kids with their summer days filled with fun activities that include; swimming, sports, games, arts and crafts, woodworking, and an Everyones Birthday Party. Everything at Camp teaches kids that they are and can be winners! Life may have taught them that they are unloved and unlucky, but we teach them that they can succeed. The Everyone's Birthday Partyis one great way we show unconditional love and support to these kids. For many of these children, their week at RFK is the first time ever in their lives to feel security, warmth and unconditional love from dedicated adult caregivers. Oftentimes, these children have never had a day all about themselves let alone a day celebrated with cake. Camp provides this event centered on celebrating everyone and making it clear that each child is special, is unique, and is loved.As a volunteer and leader planning this birthday party, I am asking for help to making it a celebration to remember. I want to be able to decorate and plan this event worthy of the great kids attending. I truly believe these children deserve the world and every chance at a lovingly fulfilled life. Please help me make a first step towards showing these children love and support by donating today!All proceeds will go towards paying for the party! I will be gathering decorations, cupcakes in all varying flavors, games, face-painting materials, and so much more.

We are located in Gray Court, SC, in Laurens County. We are the only State Recognized Cherokee Tribe in South Carolina, with a membership of 550. We own approximately six acres of land located at 3688 Warrior Creek Church Road; we named our tribal grounds, Warrior Creek. Our Tribe purchased this property in 2004.  We are the descendents of the Lower Towns of the Cherokee Nation which once occupied seven states of this country. Some of our tribal members can trace their lineage back to Chief Doublehead, Chief Attakullakulla (Little Carpenter), and Chief White Path who were great leaders of the Cherokee Nation in the 18th and 19th centuries. Our people are proficient in Cherokee traditions and crafts. Our people include flute makers and flute players, drums, dancers, craftspeople making jewelry, pipes, baskets, napping arrowpoints, and tools. We enjoy all of the culture our Grandmothers and Grandfathers passed down to us. We are a proud people teaching our youth all that we have been taught.  We are a 501(c)3 organization. We receive no federal or statefunds; we are totally sufficient. We operate a small craft shop selling the handmade crafts of our people. Along with donations from tribal members, this helps to pay the bills and to maintain our tribal grounds.We have several programs going on for our tribal members: Cherokee language, craft-making, and basket weaving. We have a school program where we teach our history and culture to students who are studying Native Americans in their classrooms. We bring the history of the Cherokees to life! The students visit a Living Village to see animal skintanning, pre-Columbus housing, a burn-out canoe, animal trapping, and listen to story telling. We built this program on the state standards for Social Studies on Native Americans. Since our program is an outdoor program, when it rains we must reschedule. We do not have a building large enough to take our program inside. Sometimes the schools can't reschedule; so they must miss the Cherokee experience.  We are asking for funds for a building large enough for up to 400 school children to see and hear our enlightening and interactive program. We have smaller versions of our housing; animal skins; hunting tools; lots of artifacts and craft items; musical instruments; and a movie clip showing our Living Village and grounds. Our story teller can relay her stories inside. It is possible to bring our history and Living Village inside so the students will not be disappointed but totally engaged.  This building would be a 40 ft x 80 ft x 12 ft metal building with bathrooms and kitchens. We can also use this building for our Pow Wow if rain threatens.Our Pow Wow is another opportunity for our people and other Native people to share their culture and heritage withthe public. The current building that we have meetings in and houses our tribal office is in dire need of repair; so we could this new building for those purposes. Down the road we envision holding language classes, basket weaving classes, dance classes in it for our people and the outside community. We are often asked from the public about classes, but we don't have the room to do that.   With your help our people will better be able to serve our school children who are only taught from books. These children will see and hear Cherokees teaching their history and their culture. This program helps to spread our story truthfully from people who have lived the Cherokee Way. Your donation will not only insure the sharing our our heritage and culture, it will bring a better understanding of the real history of a proud people. Our people will be so indebted to you forallowing us to do what we all love; and all the children and the adults we serve will be most appreciative because we will be able to reach more people.As the Cherokee people say ""Wado"" (Thank you)                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Shave My Head 4 Sheaves For Christ,"$3,635","$5,000",Charity," September 18, 2016",24,6,FRANKLIN,KY,86000,,,"                            Jerry West                                                                                                                   FRANKLIN, KY                                                        I'm Jerry West - Youth President for the Kentucky District U.P.C.I.

They took out a full-page ad in the Jackson Daily News to publish a ""Statement of Belief and Intention,"" which centered around the basic tenet: ""We believe in the essential worth and dignity of every human being."" They spoke out in spite of anticipated personal and professional risk against discrimination and in favor of equal access to employment, facilities, and opportunity.Here we are, over 40 years later, and our state has just legalized discrimination with the passage of HB1523.

Sometimes that simply is not the case. We all have a story. We all have been in tight binds, we have all struggled. Not everyone is homeless by choice. Some have lost a job, and couldnt rebound fast enough. Yes, there are some who have ran into a situation in life and couldnt find their way back. There are so many different reasons, why, how, etc. But who are we to JUDGE OTHERS? It is not our job to throw stones. Our job is to love all, help where we can, and simply Pay It Forward. My family does this to give back. They believe in this just as much as I do. I was really close to being homeless a few times, but with kids. That was so long ago, its easy to forget where I started. We started this when my kids and I had a fire, we lost our home and didnt have anything left. We were in a motel for weeks. Someone I worked with gave us a home without anything to get in. We showed our thankfulness that year by making 25 pb&j sandwiches and passing them out to people under the overpass near where we lived. Thats how this Random Act Of Kindness started for us.I know its early, but it's that time of the year when I set out to fundraise for Our Annual Thanksgiving Food and Clothing drive. This is the 4th event for my family and I to host. We do this because we know what struggle is. We know what it feels like to want more, WE have been there!! We do it because we understand. I am really going to press hard this year to make it to the $1100 dollar goal. Last year 2015 We fed 300 people and gave out 288 bags of Essentials. 2014 we fed 2 Women/Children/ and Family shelters combined. That was right here in the middle of San Jose. Due to our own circumstances, we skipped 2013, but in 2012 we fed 101 people and gave out 88 bags of needed essentials in St. James Park. This year 2016 I will be spreading holiday cheer in a few homeless encampment sections through out San Jose. I want to make 500 plates and as many Essential Bags as I can make after the food inventory for dinner has been met. Donations needed:If you dont want to give money, I understand. Maybe you want to make a donation another way, heres how you can help meIt has to go with my meal plan. Bags of Pasta..Bags of Bread, Cans of Pasta Sauce, Ground meat or Turkey.

Through the Day Program, veterans are transported from shelters across the Pittsburgh region to the Veterans Place facility on Washington Boulevard where they are provided meals, clothing, case management, health-related referrals, employment assistance and other services designed to address the root issues that cause homelessness. Veterans Place operates the only drop-in day program for homeless vets in the region and serves an average of 16 vets a day. The Transitional Housing Program can accommodate 48 homeless veterans for up to a 24-month stay in one of the 13 townhouses on Washington Boulevard.

Len observed that this economically depressed area of Arkansas was missing a Christian radio voice and was called to make it happen. He studied all aspects of broadcasting including receiving his technical certification from the Society of Broadcast Engineers and developed a plan to get the station built and launched. Community interest is strong and enthusiastic, but finances are short of what is needed. Unlike large commercial radio stations, which can cost millions of dollars to launch, Len has worked with experienced broadcasters and other professionals to develop the plan to launch KPGC for $25,000.KPGC 95.1 is an FM radio station being built in Norman, Arkansas. The station will be non-commercial, non-profit and educational. The board of the 501(c)(3) non-profit, His Will, Inc., will oversee operations. KPGC is part of a ""new breed"" of Low Power FM (LPFM) station intended to allow communities to have their own station. Coverage will reach several communities and the rural areas between them. The goals of KPGC will be to provide support and encouragement that can lead to economic growth in the surrounding areas. The station will project a positive message of hope and restoration through music and a variety of informative, educational and Biblically-based programs. Len has been developing the plans for KPGC for three years with the help of experienced broadcasters and other professionals. He completed a business plan, and the station is ready to be built. On 1/24/2017, the construction permit from the FCC will expire. If the station is not On-The-Air by that date, the project will end. In an effort to move forward, the plan has been divided into two parts. Phase 1 is conservatively designed to get the station On-The-Air as quickly and as inexpensively as possible by putting together a small studio in Len's home. Initially, the programming will come from Life Talk Radio, but local shows will be produced as soon as possible. The plans for Phase 1 enable the coverage area to remain as strong as originally planned, with the broadcast originating on a hill from the top of the city's water tower.Phase 2 will come later with plans for a studio and upgraded equipment. Standby generators will provide a stable signal during power outages. An economically equipped station building will facilitate the production of local and live broadcasts.Some equipment donations have been helpful, but most of the equipment needed to put the station On-The-Air is yet to be purchased. This includes the construction of a transmitter building, the purchase of the FM broadcast transmitter, transmission cable and broadcast antenna, Emergency Alert System (EAS), audio switcher and related broadcast interfaces and equipment. Phase 1 funding must also cover the first year of liability insurance and music royalty fees that require up front payment.Our goal is to raise the essential $18,000 of the $25,000 initial budget by the end of this campaign on November 30, 2016. With this $18,000, we can put the station On-The-Air before the January deadline, preserving our license while we pursue other fundraising efforts to support the continuing operation and further development of KPGC.The launch of KPGC, Powerful Life Radio, will be the fulfillment of the dream Len has worked for and helped finance with his 401k over the last 3 years. Not only will he be extremely thankful and appreciative to see it happen, but it will be encouraging to listeners in communities all over the area.

He has no family. He can't speak and is in a wheelchair most of the time.He was recently hit by a car while crossing the street in his wheelchair. His leg was very badly broken and he had to have surgery to fix the break. He is in a nursing facility right now but will need a home when he is released. I have been trying to get financial help for him through numerous governmental and religious organizations and haven't had any success. He can't even get section 8 housing because they give that to families with children. He receives money from the government but not nearly enough to live on. He ends up staying in seedy motels or sleeps on the street when his govt funds run out. He is a person that we would expect for the govt to take care of but unfortunately they don't. The govt failed him. Let's not fail him too. Please let's all help to take care of him.

Cowan (Sanders) founded Mothers Helping Mothers, Inc. in 2007 to help end the cycle of teen pregnancy and homelessness. The Lima, Ohio native was a teen mother herself and knows well the plight of teen mothers who lack support and the tools or resources to maintain a level of self esteem and drive to thrive. After seeing a teen mother with no place to go, Dr. Cowan began Mothers Helping Mothers Inc to help support teen mothers in Central Ohio. MHM has been able to identify and address gaps in services available to teen mothers, including the need for food, clothing, housing, daycare and educational resources.Dr. Cowan turned her situation around and began specializing in being a childcare provider in 2000. Taking this expertise and recognizing a need in her community and a valuable part of Mothers Helping Mothers Inc. programs, she started Helping Hands Learning Academy now known as Cozy Corner Home of Care & Love is able to make available job opportunities for the mothers enrolled in MHM programs, empowering them to complete their education and learn job skills. She currently has three mothers working in the learning center with future expansion plans which will depend on the completion of her Haven of Hope dorm facility they are trying to have build, which will provide additional housing for homeless mothers. Right now they are open a home on the East side of Columbus that will take two moms and two babies off the streets, but that will only help a few teen homeless moms. They have waiting list as well. So the need is there!!!Launching a daycare takes time and patience. Dr. Cowan states. We do take Title 20 vouchers provided by the state yet what the community needs to be aware of is the 30 day delay in payment which puts a strain on cash flow for incidentals and payroll. This is where the situation has escalated. Her landlord, although very generous up until this month, is demanding rental payments for a not yet profitable or financial stable business. They need your help, with a building that would be thiers it would be a blessing for the work they do and take a financial load off as far as rent goes.MHM is calling the community support to rally to her rescue by donating as little as $25 to the Mothers Helping Mothers non-profit.

I just survived my 4th and most dangerous heart surgery. I'm also a Comedian and I'm using my ability to speak to large masses to do good for people who suffer from this condition. Those affected with TOF undergo open heart surgery 3-5 times during their life (on average), in order to prolong their lifespan. This seems excessive and gives need for medical research and leaves room for vast medical improvement. In addition all the surgeries lead to insane medical costs leaving patients and their families buried financially.Also, being that our condition is a rareity, there needs to be a push for more Doctors who specialize in ""Adult Congenital Cardiology"" / Defects/ Surgery.  Below is a graph of what we face today...At this point, people's health and lives are being compromised. Generally, and until recently, Pediatric Cardiologists cared for TOF patients because they didn't live that long. So...the transition from a kid to an adult into Cardiology is basically hitting a wall. Cardiologists aren't specialized in congenital defects, they've seen little to no TOF patients and they have VERY minimal experience at treating a TOF patient if any.The ' Tetralogy of Fallot Foundation Inc.' is a foundation centered around our condition, aimed at helping those affected by the condition, and sparking change within specialized medicine.The story I just told is just a small part of the overall picture. The doctors, the bills, the red tape, the surgery, the recovery, the negative mental effects that haunt lifelong patients, the reality of being born with a condition and needing multiple surgeries so you are always broke and can never finance or rent anything...like shelter...The list goes on.This is an unbelievably complex and burdening condition to have and I feel our plight can be eased but this condition needs a voice. So I opended up the'Tetralogy of Fallot Foundation Inc.' so I could help others...And today I'm asking you to help donate to the cause. In addition, I have a documentary (link provided) that is premeiring in Florida on July 6th 2016. That is our official launch date as the foundation and all the proceeds go directly to the foundation. Since I'm a Comic it's called 'Living to be Funny'...which is just that, Im trying to survive to help others be happy. Also, this whole project/film was made to help others affected by TOF so they don't feel alone, they can laugh, they can relate, they feel understood...the list goes on. This documentary is really for others.So, please donate and help me launch this foundation so that I can help those affected with this condition. When you give, you can all be updated by going to our website www.survivetof.org and see our progress. I humbly thank you for your time...And know you are giving to one who lives with the condition...And chooses to help others.I love you all- Jay RiskPositive Disclaimer: The 'Tetralogy of Fallot Foundation Inc."" is registered and complies with the Florida Deptartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services as a 501(C)(3) non-profit organization legally allowed to accept donations.Registration: #CH47705Below is posted happily in compliance, as we are a legit foundation now looking for help starting up.Thank you again for you help!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"The Motherly Love Project,$250,"$375,000",Charity," June 6, 2016",3,3,FAIRFIELD,AL,79000,,1,"                            Kendra Anuli Burrell                                                                                                                   FAIRFIELD, AL                                My name is Kendra Burrell.

I am currently a stay at home mom , a Doula, and a breast-feeding advocate. I put all my time into making sure that my children has a great foundation and that they understand the importance of self-Love, Family first and then, education. I want to give other children and their mothers the same opportunity I give my children every day, an opportunity to learn about the world around them. I thank GOD for the family he has blessed me with. My daughter Sophia is my greatest inspiration. She's taught me that children can do anything as long as they have a constant platform for learning.My purpose for writing this letter, I want to start a Women and Infants and Children Development Centers for Alabama residents. Motherly Loves mission is to support and empower 40 women of color (annually) to breast-feed by making sure they are supported and given positive reinforcement early on during the first 6 weeks of the postpartum period. We are dedicated to helping mothers of color transition into normalize attached, gentle parenting. We encourage mothers to connect to their divine motherly spirit so that mother and child can start their bonding process prenatal. We believe that; when a mother truly connects with her, divine motherly spirit she transcends the mind and allows infused knowledge from above to take root in her heart. We seek to nurture and support the mother so that she is readily available to nurture her newborn.Motherly Love is a place to feel the support of other women of color, from all walks of life! Our goal is to help women in the surrounding communities transition into motherhood and womanhood by empowering them and providing them with a safe place to learn new things, explore opportunities, get extra help and get them excited about their future. Motherly Love is an advocate for breastfeeding, healthy eating, social skills, exercising, and self-awareness. I believe every woman needs the support and inspiration from their sisters to help them unlock the best power their minds have to offer. I want to be that inspiration for the women that everyone says is broken.Motherly Love Women and Infants services is a not-for-profit community postpartum retreat, that seeks to create a supportive environment for new mothers by supporting and educating them during the first 6 weeks of the postpartum period. We are dedicated to helping mothers of color transition into normalize attached, gentle parenting. If mothers had more support during the critical stage of breastfeeding there could potentially be a way to establish a breastfeeding bond between the mother and her infant there by increasing the success rates of exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months and beyond. Mothers can enroll into the six week program prenatal while in the third trimester. Each mother entering prenatal will be offered the support of a Birth Doula. The mothers first day into the home will be the day she is discharged from the hospital. Motherly Love will pick up mother and child from the hospital, and will be taken the retreat to being her celebration to motherhood. Each mother will have an assigned peer counselor and the opportunity to have one on one time with a licensed Lactation Consultant and Pediatrician. Each guest will be presented with fresh flowers in her room. Each mother will have her choice of a nutritious breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner each day of her stay. Each mother will have clean linens, fresh towels and toiletries upon arrival. Each mother will be gifted a breastfeeding care package, for all of her breastfeeding needs. Each guest will coexist in a room fit for two nursing mothers. Mothers with small children under the age of three years will be permitted to bring him or her along. An in house preschool will convene in the home. All accommodations will be made to support mothers with smaller children. Motherly love offers women and childrens therapy and counseling. We are a resource and development center reaching and teaching new and expecting mothers and their young children from birth to three years old . We encourage expecting mothers to breast-feed by making sure they are educated and supported early on so they can make more decisions that are informed. My team and I are dedicated to working closely with the children and their mothers to offer Doula, prenatal, breastfeeding peer counselors, and postpartum support Services, Family planning, Parenting classes, and Preschool.Starting Motherly Love Women & Infant Services is my dream.

Breast-fed babies need to eat at least 1-1/2 to every three hours or more frequently depending on your baby demands. For the First 3 months, your milk supply is establishing itself; it is best for you to nurse your baby at all feedings. Having your baby in the room with you as much as possible lets you readily nurse your baby when he or she first becomes hungry.

Looking for a great cause? For the month of September i'm asking for help to raise money to purchase LifeStraws which will provide safe drinking water to a small primitive village in the United States. On October 2nd my mom and I will complete a rigorous ten mile hike to meet the Havasupai Tribe where we will hand deliver the LifeStraws to families in the village. We will camp for four days just outside of the village to really immerse ourselves in the culture, show the tribe how to use the straws, and test our ability to thrive in a primitive lifestyle! Updates and posts will be maintained regularly so you can enjoy this journey and experience with us. The Havasupai have faced a series of wildfires this past July. I am currently unaware of the current conditions of the village. Supplying the LifeStraws will ensure safe and readily accessible water for families who may have been effected. Providing extra straws will allow for an emergency supply for future use.For every $20 donated we will provide one LifeStraw supplying one person with clean drinking water for a year (approximately 264 gallons of safe drinking water). In return, LifeStraw also provides a child in a developing country with one year of clean drinking water. If the $1,000 goal is met we will provide 26,400 gallons of drinkable water to people around the world. That's 100 LifeStraws which is the equivalent of 100 years of safe, fresh water. Six to eight million people die annually from water-related diseases. In providing this device we reduce these numbers and also allow drinkable water to be immediately accessible; meaning, users do not have to burn fossil fuels to boil the water to remove contaminants thus reducing CO2 emissions. Please share with your friends, family, loved ones, coworkers, and units! I know this is extremely last minute and I apologize sincerely. I wasn't sure I would be able to hike with much more weight (currently at 30lbs without the straws). I was thinking about the weight today and realized it's not about the difficulty of the hike but rather something so much greater than myself - providing fresh drinkable water and life to someone in need. To learn more about the product and LifeStraw's campaign, click here: https://youtu.be/i82YD7uvi2sA many thanks to those of you who contribute or have contributed to this fund! Cheers to reducing our carbon footprint and to helping others! ***About the Havasupai Tribe*** Havasupai Indian Tribe, also referred to as the ""Havasu 'Baaja"" have lived in the canyon area just east of the Grand Canyon South Rim for over 1,000 years. Havasupai means ""people of the blue-green waters"" after the color of the water that flows from the Havasu Springs through Havasu Creek as it makes its way to a series of four gorgeous waterfalls of which ""Havasu Falls"" is the most notable. The Havasupai have been the traditional guardians of the Grand Canyon. Prior to the early 1800s before the Grand Canyon was proclaimed as a National Park, the Tribe roamed a vast area on the upper plateau. During the Fall and Winter months, tribal members would move families up to the plateaus subsisting on hunting and gathering what the earth provided. They would then move back down into the canyon and planted crops during the Spring and Summer months. Supai Village & Its People Recorded members of the Tribe numbers about 650 making it one of the smallest Indian Tribes in the nation. About 450 members live at Supai Village at the base of Havasu Canyon. Children are schooled 11 months per year and upon completion of 8th grade studies, they are typically sent to government sponsored boarding high schools. Most of them return to Supai upon high school graduation. Traveling down to Havasu Falls can only be done by foot, horse or helicopter. Still, more than 12,000 visitors come to see the amazing high waterfalls. This land is sometimes called the ""Shangri-la of the Grand Canyon"" because of its towering cliffs, spectacular waterfalls and calming pools of water. The Havasupai speak a form of Yuman, which was derived from Hokan languages. These languages use prefixes, suffixes and compound words to form longer words made up of several elements. A complete sentence or phrase may be expressed by one word. The women of the tribe are still practicing basket weaving, using cottonwood and willow coils. Basket and other ther native crafts are sold on the reservation and surrounding areas. Visitors are asked to preserve the magnificence of the Havasupai homeland and respect their natural resources which contribute to their spiritual direction. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"Be The Change. ,$110,"$1,000",Charity," April 11, 2016",4,5,GREENVILLE,NC,52000,,6,"                            Taylor Tate                                                                                                                   GREENVILLE, NC                                                        Hi I am Taylor Tate, an individual aspiring to shine light on child hunger and food insecurity.

Thank you for helping Wintergreen launch another decade of encouraging creativity and the arts in Aroostook County!More about Wintergreen's1,000 Peace Cranes for The County Project:On June 4, 2016, during our Community Support Day, Wintergreen launched the year of 1,000 Peace Cranes for The County Project. The Peace Crane is developed from an ancient art of paper folding called origami. The tradition of gifting 1,000 origami peace cranes is rooted in a Japanese legend of peace and good luck. Throughout the year, Wintergreen students and volunteers are making 1,000 origami peace cranes to be sponsored and displayed at our Center. At the end of the year, each peace crane will be released throughout Aroostook County as a gesture of our gratitude to our donors and as a way of extending creativity, good will, and hope to all.                    + Read More"Help Start Twisted Beard Charities,$450,"$2,500",Charity," September 9, 2016",9,16,SIOUX FALLS,SD,49000,,,"                            James Scarson                                                                                                                   SIOUX FALLS, SD                                                        The idea of Twisted Beard Charities was born out of a desire to use our passions and talents to make a difference in the lives of the people in our communities, nation, and eventually the world.

Aaron Mankin is a true American hero. He was severely wounded while serving overseas in the US Marine Corps during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. The injuries he suffered during that attack have required him to undergo over 70 surgeries. Throughout it all, Aarons remarkable positive attitude and devotion to helping others truly make him an extraordinary inspiration to those who have had the pleasure to meet him and hear his story. He has a very deep passion for assisting other combat veterans and their families. Aaron is an Arkansas native who now resides in Rogers, AR with his two young children, Madeline and Hunter. As a single father, he juggles the challenges of raising a family with his obligations as a motivational speaker and veteran advocate. While he has spoken at events across the nation, his first priority is helping veterans closer to his home in Arkansas. Awaken Faith Foundation learned of an urgent need for reliable transportation which would facilitate his efforts to continue participating in events throughout the area. As such, the foundation procured a Jeep Grand Cherokee in order to meet that need.To date, charitable contributions have offset half the cost of the vehicle. We are asking for your help to assist us in raising the other half. Any funds collected beyond this goal will be given directly to Aaron. These donations will undoubtedly greatly help Aaron and his family. In addition, they will aid numerous others who will benefit from his involvement in events and organizations that reach out to others in need.Please consider helping us make a difference in the life of a wounded combat veteran and real American hero.Thank you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_l_Llrvm6k + Read More"Preschool & Temple need a boiler,"$3,742","$70,000",Charity," January 10, 2016",26,8,SAN LEANDRO,CA,46000,,1,"                            ilisa kessler                                                                                        on behalf of Temple Beth SholomSAN LEANDRO, CA                                We are a congregation that teaches tzedakah ""charity"". We have always been in the position to give, but now find ourselves asking to receive. Temple Beth Sholom has been serving the Bay Area since 1886, when a small group of committed Jews came across the Bay to form the San Leandro Hebrew Congregation. Almost 120 years later, Temple Beth Sholom continues to commit itself to Judaism, the Jewish People, and the Jewish heritage. It holds a vibrant, diverse and warm environment, which continues to grow and evolve for modern day needs and sensibilities.We also have a thriving multi-culturalpreschool. All kids are welcome and weare proud of the diversity of our preschool kids and teachers. At Beth Sholom Preschool, children learn lifelong skills: to like themselves, to explore and to discover the world around them, to solve problems, to make friends and to develop social skills.We are asking the greater community to help us fix our boiler so we can heat our building again. Our congregation is only 100 families and we alone can not raise all of the funds to replace the boiler. There is a limited amount of heat and during the school day, the children and teachers are too cold. The sanctuary is also cold for our aging congregation that comes to worship. With winter just starting we are at a critical time to get the boiler fixed. This boiler is from the 50's.We are ready to hire a contractor to get this done, but need the money. Any amount of Tzedakah is welcome and appreciated. Thank you from our warm hearts.You can learn about our synagogue here:  www.tbssanleandro.orgYou can learn more about our preschool here: http://www.bethsholompreschool.org+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"
