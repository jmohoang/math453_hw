                        Hello loves, my name is Adwoa Kyei and I am competing in the 2016 Miss Ghana Tourism USA pageant.This pageant aims to promote Ghana as a tourist destination for those living abroad through representation of its ten regions by contestants. The historic significance, tradition, and beauty of each region are put on display in an effort to show what Ghana has to offer.Being born and raised in Accra, the rich culture and heritage have been engrained in me and I have developed a deep love for the area. The central region has led me to becoming the God fearing woman I am today, therefore, I am proud to represent the region and share its importance with the rest of the world.My overall aim is to become an advocate for the sanitization of Ghana, leading to healthier living conditions for all of its citizens. General clean-up and efforts placed towards the environmental sustainability of the country would greatly improve the health and safety of the people, and assure a bright future for Ghana. Your contributions would serve wholly in allowing me to reach my full potential and accomplishing my goals.Come support me as I venture to make our homeland Ghana a better place. God bless you all

Hello! My name is Eleanor Doran and I have been acceptedas a state finalistfor the Miss Massachusetts USA Pageant 2016. I have started this GoFundMe in hopes of raising enough money to attend thepageant in November.

A little about me: I'm a new graduate of the University of Vermont where I studied Elementary Education and Communication Sciences and Disorders with minors in Special Education and Theatre. I loved my program and I love the school where I'm working now. My goal in the future is to be a special educator. I enjoy reading and writing but will also pass the time with video games or movies. You can find me at several conventions in the North East such as Anime Boston, Boston Comicon, Conneticon, etc. in cosplay. In general no one expected me to enter this competition but I did and I'll need your help to get to it. If you can please donate, I apreciate every penny.

About the pageant: The money donated will be used to cover the costs of the pageant weekend, such as meals, prizes and production costs. Any money I earn above the 1,295 required will be used to help me purchase items required for the event such as: shoes, a bathing suit, a ball gown and makeup. I need to submit the money by 7/15/16 but am hoping to finish my fundraising well before that.

It would mean a great deal to me if you contribute to my cause. Although I've never been in a pageant before, I am hoping to make the most of this one. It truly is a life changing event and if I am crowned Miss Massachusetts I will move on to compete at the Miss USA pageant in 2017, something I've never dreamed of!

There are many great funds on this website, and many people deserving of the money. Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to those who contribute, any amount helps!*This photo was taken by my friend.

PORTLAND, ME                                





                        Hi friends!I have been fortunate enough to be selected again to compete this coming November for the prestigious title of Miss Maine USA 2017.As you may or may not know, I am a 25 year old licensed cosmetologist pursuing my passions in the beauty industry in downtown Portland. I am very lucky thatI have found my calling within my career. I absolutely love to make people feel beautiful! Helping others feel good about themselves both internally and externally is my main priority. I'm fortunate that between my job and advocating for mental health, I am able to do just that. My dreams have come to life through following my heart, which has lead to other roads and opportunities allowing me to focus on a subject that is very important to me.I have struggled with my anxiety and depression my entire life. I always felt isolated and misunderstood until I took it upon myself to get help, which allowed me to learn and understand myself and specifically how I tick. In the last year I have been diagnosed as bipolar ll. Though terrifying at first, this diagnosis has lead to a complete change in my entire perspective on life. I can say with 100% confidence, that I am now happier and healthier than ever and have finally found ways to survive and cope which I never could have fathomed before. To wake up gracious and thankful to be alive everyday is such a blessing that I will never take for granted again.I feel there is a huge negative stigma surrounding mental health, and people of all ages are terrified to even breach the topic. With this platform I am hoping to bring awareness and understanding to all mental illnesses, to abolish the taboo and to show others that you CAN balance it all. I have learned how to take care of myself both mentally and physically while also balancing my dream job and a personal life. To make a difference in just one person's life would mean the world to me. I'm very thankful to have the chance to make my voice heard and to talk about my passions openly and comfortably. Im thrilled to have to chance to combine my love of both inner and outer beauty. Pageantry has taught me that life truly is all about the path we chose to take. It's about being the happiest version of you, and learning how to do just that. It's taking care of yourself physically and mentally to present the healthiest and happiest version of you. For me, I will use this opportunity to be a voice for others struggling with mental health and to be a role model for men and women everywhere. Happiness is a journey and I'm really proud of mine! If you have the means, please donate! Any amount, no mater how small will assist me in getting back up on that stage again! MISS MAINE USA 2017 HERE WE COME!!! THANK YOU! Xoxo

2017 MISS CALIFORNIA USA,$545 ,"$3,500 ",Competitions," July 24, 2016",14,2,LOS ANGELES,CA,3300,,8,"

LOS ANGELES, CA                                




WHO AM IA native of Seattle, WA, but currently a resident of The City of Angels, I AM A PHENOMENAL EXTRA ORDINARY WOMAN representing MISS HEART OF HOLLYWOOD USA competing for the title of 2017 MISS CALIFORNIA USA.Raised in a co-parenting household with parents who had two totally different parenting styles, the journey was ""like a box of chocolate"". However, the one thing that was evident was that their sacrifices were and still remain great as they continue to develop and encourage me to be a STRONG BLACK WOMAN who understands and respects that ALL LIVES MATTER!I Love MUSIC! Music soothes the soul and thanks to my father, my introduction to music started well before I entered the world. I was introduced to the melodic tunes of Jazz Great Myles Davis in utero and emerged as a small child with a great ear, voice, and interest in music. By age 5, I performed my rendition of Beyonces Listen in an elementary school talent show and thereafter continued to cultivate my craft by performing for various audiences in my community and beyond leading me to pursue a career in music now as a young adult. I aim to be the type of artist that creates music that transcends time with timeless elements like the contributions of artist I admire such as Aaliyah, Janet Jackson, Etta James and Beyonce who have music that will continue to inspire the world for years to come. Having a heart to serve, thanks to my mother, at the early age of 12, I experienced one of the most sacred forms of serving; washing the feet of the homeless on Skid Row in Los Angeles for the non-profit organization The ASHE Foundation. The foundation collects and distributes shoes and clothing to women and children of African countries who have been displaced due to War, Poverty and AIDS. Through my volunteer efforts with The ASHE Foundation, we have raised over $450k in-kind donations since its inception. 

When I am not serving my community, recording or blazing the stage with a performance, I am ripping the runway for a cause as a fashion model for Spanish designer Ricardo Soltero, Ankara Festival, fashion coordinator Parris Harris or Twin of a Kind/Pretty Girl Retreat (empowering young girls thru fashion)When I am not recording or performing, I am engulfed in my college studies at Santa Monica Community College. An early high school graduate, I ended my high school year in the top 10% of my class and VP of the National Honor Society. Now a sophomore at SMC, I have received numerous scholarships for my high academic achievements including a scholarship from the Black Collegians at SMC. Furthermore, I was awarded the opportunity to attend UCLA STP (Summer Transfer Program). This program is designed to help student of color successfully transfer into top schools like UCLA and USC. It is my plan to transfer as a Communication/Business major to UCLA or USC. WHAT AM I RAISING MONEY FORI am excited to announce that I have been accepted and am now officially part of a select group of exceptional young women chosen to participate in the 2017 Miss California USA or Miss California Teen USA Pageant. My involvement also provides me the chance to be awarded the crown, receive scholarships and go on to represent California at the national MISS USA PAGEANT or MISS TEEN USA PAGEANT. Current 2016 MISS USA is the PHENOMENAL EXTRA ORDINARY WOMAN DESHAUNA BARBER from Washington D.C. I am so excited to be apart of this experience and I know that I will represent my community, friends and family with beauty, style, intelligence and uniqueness that has been instilled in me by my parents.  HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USEDThere is a contestant entry fee of $1,550, which includes everything I will need during pageant weekend (Dec. 2-4 in Long Beach, CA). From the time I check in all my meals, my hotel room, rehearsals, production fees, hair and makeup stylists for touch ups for the finals show, on staff medics, chaperones, up until my departure. However, I am responsible for my own costs traveling to and from the host city where the pageant will be held and all wardrobe (gown included) and pre-preparations. The entry fee also includes my photo taken for the program book, entry for me and my family to scheduled sessions with industry professionals and sponsors at our official orientation in October.HOW SOON DO I NEED THE FUNDS$500 of the contestant entry fee is due immediately with the balance due by September 23.I am fully invested in giving back to the community through my performing gifts and as the next MISS CALIFORNIA USA. I plan to use my musical career and the title of MISS CALIFORNIA USA as means to give back in a larger context. Through music I will spread messages of encouragement for people who come from at-risk communities to inspire hope and change, while through my philanthropic actions I plan to contribute to worthy causes and act as a liaison to further their missions. Your support in the journey would mean the world to me and help me achieve the financial obligation by the designated deadline.Thank you for your prayers and continuous support!

                        Hi! I am Regan - the quirky kid you know from school or community events. I want to invite you to help me compete for Nebraska Teen USA 2017 in January. I personally use the statement Break the Status Quo to describe the way I approach life. I like to be independent and always work to let my personality shine through. Teens work too hard to be like everyone else and to fit in but I think we all need to believe in ourselves and celebrate our individual gifts. I do a number of different things that help me be a role model of individuality for others in our school and our community. I am a drummer who marches to my own beat and a dancer who enjoys both hip-hop and ballet. I have worked really hard to be the ADHD student on the honor roll and a leader in the classroom.  Because I dont worry as much about where I fit in, I can be nice to everyone. I have a lot of patience since I have struggled in school at times and I have been helping others whenever I can. I enjoy church activities listening to music and I have danced for 14 years. I think that I can continue to Break the Status Quo and that this philosophy will help me to be successful in school and in life.I am really excited to tell you that I get the chance in January to Break the Status Quo as the short-haired, quirky teen at Nebraska Teen USA 2017. I have been accepted to be a finalist and will be competing as Miss Saline County Teen! This is the first step in a journey that could see me servingas Miss Teen USA 2017 - part of the Miss USA and Miss Universe systems. I want to be a part of this amazing program because of the opportunities it would provide to me including scholarships, workshops, and travel. It would also give me the chance to help others celebrate their own unique gifts as a role model. I want YOU to be a part of this so that I can share this journey with my friends and family and with the community that I call home. I need to raise $1500 to cover the balance of my sponsorship fees and help offset my training and transportation to the competition. Be a part of #TeamRegan - every gift will mean so much to me.  My sponsorship information is due to Nebraska Teen USA by the end of Septemberso jump on board quick if you want a chance to be listed in the program as a sponsor. If you can't donate now - thank you for taking the time to read more about me and try to Break the Status Quo in your own world.

                        Hello!My name is Jaiden Rose and I was just chosen to compete in the Miss Kansas Teen USA pageant.I'm not your typical pageant girl. In fact, I've only been in two all-natural pageants when I was littleso this is all new for me. Also new for me this year? High school. I've been unable to attend school the past two years as I've battled chronic illness(I have chronic migraines, POTS and was recently diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) . That's why I wanted to enter- to prove to other chronically ill kids that they can do anything they want when they put their minds to it.I am a dancer, dreamer and believer of big things. I'm also a fighter. Once told I'd wind up in a wheelchair because I have POTS, I've worked hard to make sure it doesn't happen. I'd love to be chosen as this year's Miss Kansas Teen USA to bring awareness to invisibleand rare illnesses. And, to prove that chronic illness doesn't define me. I'd also like to give back to my community.Currently, I'm looking for monetary support to help me on this journey. Themoney will be used to help cover my entry fees, coaching, personal training, wardrobe, accessories and travel expenses. The funds that are left over after all expenses are paid, will be donated to the I Love Children's Mercy Fund to help my local children's hospital.I've worked hard to raise money for them in the past and I'm passionate about helping others.I can't begin to tell you how much a donation would mean to me. No amount is too small and every donation will be acknowledged on social media and in my mom's blog. If you're interested to become a sponsor, please contact my parents through the link below.Lastly, I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't a fighter, but I also wouldn't be here without all the support I've had from others throughout the years. I'm looking forward to representing all of you in November!Jaiden Rose BuckertMiss Prairie Fire 2017

                        Hello everyone,My name is Carly Meek and I am participating in the 2017 Miss Montana USA pageant. This is a first for me, and I never really considered pageantry seriously until I watchedthisvideo. I am participating in the pageant under the title Miss Downtown Missoula USA on September 3rd and 4th of 2016. This is the last year that I am eligible to participate and I am so excited about it. I am asking for your help to raise money for my sponsorship. This includes the fees associated with all paperwork, production of the pageant, my sash and the required swimsuit, the hotel accomodations and food for the weekendof the pageant, as well as travel expenses should I happen to win the pageant and proceed to Miss USA.With pageantry comes a stigma that the women who participate are all attention-seeking debutantes, but I want to break that stigma. I chose to participate because I want to inspire other women and young girls (or anyone, really) by demonstrating that physical beauty isn't what matters. Having ambitions and the courage to do whatever it takes to get there.... having confidence and self-respect..... stepping outside one's comfort zone every once in a while..... These are things that matter. Life isn't just going to fall into your lap. It's survival. It's cutthroat. And you must transcend every challenging second of it. My ambition is to become a medical doctor. I want to not just treat patients, but empower them; educate them. I want to be a revolutionary doctor. Now let's get real. This pageant isn't going to make me a doctor. That's what medical school is for. The pageant is an opportunity to inspire others and raise awareness about things that I care about. Namely, domestic violence, drug addiction, and equality issues. But you'll hear more about this later in my interview. Let's get back to the point. I have set a goal to raise $1000 by Sunday, August 14th, 2016. Any and all contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for those who wish to support me financially. Your moral support and time you took to read this mean a great deal to me as well!

                        Hello!My name is Alexandra Marguerite Curd and I am truly blessed to be the reigning Miss Black Ohio USA 2016! I could not be more excited for the marvelous opportunities ahead of me in the coming months and I am planning some incredibly exciting things for my reign!My platform, Redefining Justice: Reformation of the American Criminal Justice System, is one that touches me as a social scientist, as an African American woman, and as an American citizen.'The Land of the Free' has the largest imprisoned population in the world (743 per 100,000), far exceeding the incarceration rate of the country that comes in second (Russia, with 577 per 100, 000). According to Michelle Alexander in her critically acclaimed book 'The New Jim Crow', there are more African Americans represented in the criminal justice system today (including prison, parole and probation) than were held in bondage in 1850. Men and Women of color are incredibly over-represented in this system, seemingly due to the fact that areas where POC dwell are often over-policed and greatly lacking in resources and opportunity. Criminal justice reform is not only my platform, but I also aspire to have a career in criminal justice, hoping to do what I can to redefine what justice looks like in this country.As with any good thing, this road won't be easy (or free!), so any support you can offer me will be greatly appreciated! Any donation, no matter how large or small, can and will be utilized! All donations will be used for:-Fees and dues associated with pageant-Travel expenses during my reign andHotel expenses during Pageant Week-Hair and Makeup-Professional Photos-Pageant wardrobe which includes: Evening Gowns, Fitness wear, and outfits for other portions of the pageant.-Wardrobe for apperances including: Suits, dresses, shoes and other accessoriesIf you own or work for a company that is interested in supporting me by purchasing an ad in the lovely Black Royalty magazine, feel free to send me an email.Also, if you would like to donate any products or any of the items listed above that would be wonderful as well!Thank you so much in advance for your support in this wonderful journey!Alexandra Marguerite CurdMiss Black Ohio USA 2016missblackohio2016@gmail.comFacebook: Miss Black Ohio 2016

I have been taking voice lessons for over seven years, have released two albums of original music, and have been acting since I was in elementary school.Recently, I was given the incredible oppurtunity to take a trip to Los Angeles this January to attend IMTA (The International Models and Talent Association). This competition brings in talent scouts and agents from all around the globe to watch young artists perform. Even those who don't win a particular category still may be contacted by these agents and offered jobs in the industry. This competition has lauched the careers of Elijah Wood, Ashton Kutcher, and many others. You can read more about it here: https://www.imta.com/It is a huge honor to be asked to attend this competition, and it is very exciting to think how this may affect my career. However, it does not come cheap. I need to pay for hair, makeup, wardrobe, training sessions, hotel and airfare... not to mention the costs of the competition itself.Even the smallest donation will help- it would mean the world to me, and it could truly change my life.

                        Hi everyone! My name is Alana Andersen,I am a 19 year old student at Drexel University competing for the title of Miss Pennsylvania USA 2017 in December. When I was 12 years old I was diagnosed with slight scoliosis that after several years of unsuccessful treatment and therapy, turned into severe scoliosis. Once I was 16, I received spinal fusion surgery in order to correct the curvature of my spine. The spinal fusion surgery gave me confidence, and allowed me to live a pain free, happy life.I plan on raising awareness about scoliosis in using the deformity and its complications as my platform for the pageant. I want to provide the state of Pennsylvania with knowledge and insight on scoliosis and its statistics as well as treatments, in hopes of one day informing the entire country. Sharing my experience with the disease while competing in a beauty pageant, will hopefully provide hope and inspiration to adolescents and teenagers struggling with scoliosis, just as I did. In order to prepare for and enter the pageant, quite a bit of money is required so that is why I created this page.I am currently an advocate, member, and speaker for Curvy Girls, a support group for young girls struggling with all stages of scoliosis as well as a member of the National Scoliosis Foundation. I will be donating 20% of whatever money is raised by December to the National Scoliosis Foundation. A huge thank you to everyone for reading my story and to those who donate, it is very much appreciated.

Being Miss Maryland will provide me with the resources, influence and platform to help our young girls on a larger scale. Seeing an African American, curly haired, Miss Maryland born and raised in Baltimore city, will serve as a reminder that where you are from doesn't determine where you are going. It will challenge ""beauty"" standards and young girls will be able to identify and accept the beauty, intelligence and confident that each one of them already possesses. 

I want our young girls to know that nothing is impossible ..... and becoming Miss Maryland is only the beginning.

                        Hello to all of our family and friends!Thank you for taking the time to read our story and learn a little bit about our little girl Yanelis.Yani is 6 years old this year and in the first grade. She had the opportunity to compete in her very first pageant in March 2016. We had never done anything like it before and I have always thought Yani would be really good at it. I figured, "" Hey I don't know how much it costs, but I don't care, my baby has the looks, the personality and the talent."" So I took a chance and entered her in the Miss American Co-ed Pageant.I got help from my fab friend Jaymie Alexander and her and I whipped up Yani's first pageant dress. I put together some outfits from her closet for her modeling competition and talent. Yani and I choreographed a dance routineand together we wrote her personal introduction (what she says to introduce herself to the crowd and the judges). I pulled together all of my resources and we made it happen.****By the way, this pageant requires the little ones to be all natural. No make-up at all. Yani rocked her beautiful curls and that toothless smile!***Needless to say, Yaniworkedthat entire pageantand ended up taking first place in the following categories: ""Best Hair"", Talent, Modeling & She won the crown and title of 2016 Miss Colorado American Princess. ""Yay Yani!"" We were so excited for her and are super proud!Yani being crownedmeant that she qualifies to go straight to the Nationals to respresent Colorado in the Princess division. Wewill be going to Walt Disney World in Orlando,Florida to support Yani as she competes for the National Title! ( Not bad for her first try and she earned it fair and square!) Yani was representing for all of the little afro-latina girls in Colorado. Heyyyy!Long story short! Shortly after our daughters very exciting victory, we experienced a financial hardship that really hit us hard. This bump in the road has been a small set back for our family and we have since then been able to bounce back onto our feet. In the midst of all of the stress and chaos, I had to put preparing for Yani's pageant on the back burner until things settled down and I could really focus on the pageant.We are now 60days away from National's and they take place the week of Thanksgiving, which means that prices for everything from the Disney hotel room to the flights are skyrocketted!We are asking for help from all of our family, friends and supporters to help us raise the money we need to send our princess to Florida! Anything helps and we are working tirelessly to make sure that she has everything that she needs to compete and for us all to be there to cheer her on!

Hey everyone! 


Kylie is the new American Coed's Miss Garden State Sweetheart 2016!! 


The Miss American Coed Pageants is a scholarship pageant system for girls and young women between the ages of 3-22. The pageant was founded in 1983. The events are family-oriented and age-appropriate. They encourage and reinforce the confidence and natural beauty that is within each and every girl. That's why you'll never find any make-up on a MAC Pageant participant under age 13. 


All of Kylie's hard work this year has paid off and she is now eligible to compete at nationals. Like most 10 year olds, she is most excited about going to Disney World. Will you please help her reach her goal? 


Her goal is to raise $3000 towards her competition fees, and traveling expenses. There are many ways to help and contribute, none of which are too big or too small. Nationals will be held in Orlando, Florida during the week of Thanksgiving. 


Kylie's aspires to become an actress, and being a queen is great exposure. ""If you want something you have never had, you must be willing to do something you have never done."" -Thomas Jefferson 


Nationals here we come!

                        On November 3rd, I achieved my life-long dream of becoming Miss Indiana USA 2014. As a victim of Child Abuse, I have made it my life mission to be the voice of children who are being abused every day; as Miss Indiana USA, I have already made significant strides in prevention and awareness! My next step is taking Child Abuse Awareness to the national level as I compete for Miss USA!Over the next couple of months I will be physically and mentally training, as well as, preparing my wardrobe for the nearly 2 1/2 weeks I will be spending with the 50 other contestants at the Miss USA pageant. While my State Pageant and the amazing State Pageant Sponsors are providing me with necessities to compete at the national level, I want to make sure I am as prepared as possible to bring the FIRST Miss USA title to Indiana! In addition to my preparations, I am continuing my work with Child Abuse Awareness and other non-profit organizations. This means spending from my personal limited resources; this is where I need your help! I would like to raise $8,000 to help cover the costs of additional physical and mental prep; and this would allow my family to attend the pageant in Baton Rouge to cheer me on as I fulfill my life-long dream! Most importantly, I would like to be able to continue traveling around Indiana to work with Child Abuse Awareness and Prevention.You see, I want to be prepared to win this for not only myself, but for Indiana and all of the loving people who have supported and believed in me throughout the state and even worldwide! I know I can win the Miss USA pageant with your help and hope to make history by being the first Miss USA of Native American decent and Indiana's first Miss USA!! Any amount of contribution would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me on my journey! I can't wait to make Indiana proud ""live"" on NBC on June 8th at the Miss USA Pageant!Feel free to follow my journey to Miss USA on my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/MekaylaDiehlforMissINUSA

                        Hello friends and family! I am excited to announce my participation in the Miss Oklahoma USA pageant again this December. I am your Miss Sooner State USA 2017! I've created this GoFundMe page to aid in my participation for the pageant. I am seeking sponsors who are willing to help me reach my goal of becoming Miss Oklahoma USA! In order to participate I need to raise $2000 in sponsorship fees and coaching! Any little bit helps! As many of you know, my youngest brother Turner was diagnosed with Autism at the age of 4. Autism awareness is a cause that is near and dear to my heart. Luckily Oklahoma passed legislation this year, HB 2962, for Autism Insurance Reform. This means the state of Oklahoma now mandates that Autism therapies, physical, occupational, speech or behavioral therapies etc., and other related expenses be covered by insurance companies up until the age of 9! I am proud to have been an advocate for this legislation and was able to make a difference for our children here in Oklahoma affected by Autism. If I do become Miss Oklahoma USA 2017 I would continue to be an advocate for Autism Awareness as well as other causes. As many of you know I've competed for the title of Miss Oklahoma USA for 3 years now and this December will be my fourth time competing! I continue to improve myself and my skills every year and am so excited to continue on this journey. Below are some links to learn more about Autism and ways that you can help as well as links to some other causes and events that I've been a part of this past year!  www.autismspeaks.org - for more information about Autism and ways to help nationally  www.autismoklahoma.org - for more information about volunteer events here in Oklahoma  www.warriorsforross.com or Ross-foundation.org - the charity organization sponsored by Vanbros for children battling cancer  www.missamazingpageant.com - a pageant for girls and women with disabilities, I had a BLAST last March volunteering for this organization, I highly recommend volunteering!

                        My name is Bitanya Tefera, and I am a first year student at Ohio University, studying Pre-Law with a minor in German. My goal this year is to succeed in school, but also to get involved. Therefore, I decided to be a part of the Blackburn Spencer Scholarship Pageant here at Ohio University. One of the responsibilities of being a contestent is to raise money, which will be dedicated to the scholarship. Raising this money will be for a good cause, and it will also help me win the pageant! The pageant is on October 8th, and every donation will be very much appreciated. Thank you so much!

Debaters (also referred to as Senators and Representatives) alternate delivering speeches for and against the topic in a group setting. An elected student serves as a presiding officer to ensure debate flows smoothly. Students are assessed on their research, argumentation, and delivery skills, as well as their knowledge and use of parliamentary procedure.What is NSDA ?The National Speech & Debate Association believes communication skills are essential for empowering youth to become engaged citizens, skilled professionals, and honorable leaders in our global society. We connect, support, and inspire a diverse community of honor society members committed to fostering excellence in young people through competitive speech and debate activities. What is Impact Through Debate ?Impact Through Debate is a non-profit organization that provides support to speech and debate programs at middle and high schools. We support nearly 100 students at numerous campuses. Our organization started in 2011 and began finding unique and creative solutions to provide the resources needed to develop and maintain programs at various locations. Our goal is to provide a range of resources to start, develop and build speech and debate programs. We believe that public speaking and debate education, and the benefits they provide, are critical to the improvement of schools, communities, and the lives of the students who participate. How can I help?Every donation helps--no matter how small. Y'all were so helpful last time--and this time our need is less. Why is your goal amount smaller than last time?1.

I was also offered a featured extra spot in Anchorman 2 and had a blast working with Will Ferrell! I enjoy charity work and havehelped raise money for Rady Children's Hospital as well as the Make-A-Wish Foundation. I am currently applying for an internship position with Best Buddies San Francisco, and am hopeful to obtain that goal of mine! This fundraising page is for you to help me achieve myultimate goal - to become the next Miss California USA. The pageant has many expenses and while I'm working to save money, it will not be enough.

If you do decide to help by donating to my goal, I will be sure to put you on my e-mailing list. I will also update you with my progress in the Miss California USA 2015pageant and any future endeavors.

                        On October 18th and 19th I have the incredible opportunity to run for Miss Washington USA and if I win I I get to go on and compete for Miss USA. This experience will teach me so many useful skills for my future and will give me a great chance to really grow into the confident and driven person I want and know I can be while also giving me great networking and scholarship opportunities. I haven't always been the type of person to have a whole lot of confidence to do the things I want to do and recently I've been making big life decisions to really turn my life around and give myself a real chance at a future. Between freshmen year of High School and now I've lost a lot of people in life and gone through a lot of life changes and at the time I didn't really know how to cope with those things. I would escape my problems through alcohol and I saw myself losing my future and all of the things I ever dreamed about. I've learned a lot over the past few months and I'm learning how to really grab onto the opportunities in front of me and how to better myself and really cope with my problems without escaping through a substance.Nobody's perfect, we all make mistakes and the best thing we can do is learn from those mistakes and move forward. When I had my interview for Miss Washington USA I made the decision to be honest about the type of person I used to be, knowing that it may jeopardize my chances at running. After admitting to my wrongs to some strangers I had just met there was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. It helped me put aside the things I had done and say ""Yes, that was who I was but it won't influence who I become"". After changing my life around I've been so much happier and have met so many incredible and supportive people. Yes, I do still make mistakes but I'm only human and I want to take this chance to really put myself out there and push myself to do something completely out of my comfort zone that can benefit me so greatly.Not only am I hoping to better myself but I'm also hoping that by me changing my life around I will have the ability to influence others who feel stuck or like they're slipping to know that it's never to early or late to stop the pattern. You CAN change. It just depends on how bad you really want it and what you're willing to do to get it.This is all new to me and I may not come out on top but I know it will be an amazing experience that will lead me to success.(I have 8 openings for business sponsors on the website under my bio and 8 openings that will be listed in the program book for the competition which will be for $200+ donations. This is also tax deductible so if you send me a message on facebook with your address I will be more than happy to send you the receipt!)Thank you so much for your support, it means a lot for you to encourage me in my growth and ambitions. Love,Kelsea

The sincerity, grace, dedication, leadership and strength that Miss Ghana USA exemplifies has inspired me to serve the world with my talents. Becoming Miss Ghana USA 2014 would mean far more than wearing a crown and a beautiful dress for an evening. It would mean using my voice, my passion, and the role to bring awareness to an important social and health issue. Pushing past my fear of judgement and self doubt, I entered the competition to raise awareness about maternal mortality, a health issue currently affecting Ghana. As Miss Ghana USA 2014, I would be using the blessings and gifts I have been given by God to defy negativity and turn my dream into a reality. I am excited to embark on a journey towards making a lasting and positive impact in our global community.Through this website, I am kindly asking for your monetary support; no matter how big or small the donation, I am forever thankful for all of the love and support on my journey!

                        Hello Everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read my page! I am raising money to pay formy last minute expenses before I compete in the Miss Nevada USA Pageant!Last year I had the opportunity to compete and placed in the top 5. Iam excited to get back out there, and hopefully attain my goal of being the next Miss Nevada USA!Here's a little more about my background in pageantry, as well as why I want to become the next Miss Nevada USA...I have always looked up to the women who competed in pageants. Unfortunately, their seemingly flawless appearance and performance made them unrealistic, and un-relatable role models for me. Growing up I was shy and wanted nothing to do with the attention that came along with makeup and sparkly dresses. My participation in pageantry was not inspired by a past similar to the kids on Toddlers and Tiaras. In fact it was the exact opposite.My spark for competing was ignited from remembering what it was like growing up not feeling beautiful. I always wished I had a role model that I could not only look up too, but also findsomeone I could see myself in.Now that I have been given the opportunity to compete in the MissNevada USA pageant I can be an example forgirls like me; girls who dont quite see how their quirks fit into society'sstereotypical image of beauty. Women in the spotlight do a disservice to young girls when they only show theperfected,""made-up"" versionof themselves to the world. I believe ""Imperfection is beauty.""As a titleholder, I think it's important to not only share your blessings and achievements, but also discussyour challenges, insecurties, and fears. I want torepresent a more relatable beauty for the youth of Nevada.Please help me on my journey tobecoming the next Miss Nevada USA!!

ESSEX JUNCTION, VT                                




Dear,Fellow friends, family, and community members
I am pleased to inform you that I,
Gina Bernasconi, have been chosen as a contestant to compete in the Miss
Vermont USA 2014 pageant.  I am a 19-year-old
Para educator at Founders Memorial School in Essex Junction, Vermont. I am
currently working towards my Bachelors Degree in Special Education. I volunteer
at Fletcher Allen Hospital on the pediatrics floor.  I also volunteer at The Sustainability
Academy in Burlington where I help educate refugees. I have recently completed
a 1200-hour Spa Therapy program and am now a certified Massage therapist. This
is my second year in the Miss Vermont USA pageant. With my past experience as a
burn victim my pursuit in life has changed tremendously. I am now an advocate
for those with disabilities, special needs, and all those whose lives have been
changed through trauma. I believe this opportunity to become Miss Vermont USA
will give me a chance to become a role model and reach out to those in need. 

In order to compete I must raise
$1,200 for fees and expenses. This includes: pageant entry fee, production
cost, hotel reservation, and meals throughout the weekend. The only way this is
possible is with your help. With every donation I am one step closer to competing in the Miss Vermont USA 2014 pageant and achieving my goal.

Any amount you choose to donate toward my journey to become
Miss Vermont USA 2014, will be most helpful, and greatly appreciated. I am
thankful for your dedication and encouragement. Without you this could not be
possible!

Sincerely,
Gina Marie Bernasconi

                        Hello everyone! It's pageant time again...I will be competing in the Miss Dallas USA 2014 pageant on April 27th, 2014 in Richardson, Texas at the Eisemann Center. As some of you may know I competed in this same pageant last year, and was in the Top 3 for Swimsuit and evening gown, along with being named 1st Runner-Up. Competing in pageants takes a lot of commitment and drive along with costing a lot of money.To even compete in the pageant we must pay $495 for an entry fee. We also must buy our own dress, swimsuit, opening number outfit, interview dress and headshots. While it does sound like a lot, I plan on finding ways to save any way I can. I am asking yall to please help me reach this goal of mine to have the honor of winning Miss Dallas USA 2014 and continuing on to Miss Texas USA in September! I am hopeing to raise around $2,000, so any donation helps.Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this pageant journey since I started 4 years ago. I am so thankful to have such positive family and friends pushing me the entire way! I pray I make yall proud this year at Miss Dallas USA 2014.

                        Thank you so much for visiting my sponsorship page! My name is Audrey Knox and I am competing in the Miss North Hollywood pageant in just a couple months. This brand new program is in its second year, and I am so excited to be a part of the Miss USA system. It's my third pageant, and my goal is to make this my best one yet, but I need your help.Competing in pageants has helped improve my interview skills, given me confidence on stage no matter what I'm wearing, and helped introduce me to an amazing community of warm, helpful, and beautiful women that couldn't be further from the stereotypical image that most people have of what pageant participants are like. Most importantly, however, it's given me a sense of community and social responsibility in a town where people can so easily get caught up in their own lives.The official charities of the Miss North Hollywood orangization are Operation: Blankets of Loveand The Susan G. Komen Foundationfor breast cancer awareness and research, but as a screenwriting major from Chapman University passionate about helping kids achieve their full potential, I am also taking on the local organizationReading Opens Mindsas my official charity in the hopes that my pageant efforts will not only help me grow as a person and a professional, but also help encourage child literacy and education.I also want to get more involved in the North Hollywood community. As a titleholder, I plan on taking on a project that I have been wanting to work on for years now: I've considered making a New Year's Resolution to only shop at local, small businesses, but I've never made the leap to this challenging commitment. If I win the Miss North Hollywood title, however, I pledge to spend my entire reign using my hard-earned money to support local businesses and stores and never shopping at national chains, in order to bring money and supportto the companies that have supported me.Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you want to get involved with the organization. There are plenty of advertising opportunities, and I am willing to work with you to help with whatever your goals or needs are. I truly believe that you will not regret your donation (of time or money). Also, I understand that not everyone has the funds to contribute a large amount, but even a few dollars will help me achieve my goals! For updates on my pageant journey, and photos/info about my sponsors and event results, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!I look forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your support.Have a great day!xoxo Audrey

                        Dear Friends and Family
As most of you know Maiya is a busy young lady
dancing and swimming while maintaining an A & B Middle School report
card.  Both extracurricular activities
have provided two very special opportunities to Maiya. 
As a member of Setting the Barre Dance Studio's Junior
Dance Company, Maiya will be performing in the Disney Dance Program in Walt Disney World for 2013!  This
is huge accomplishment for these young dancers and Maiya is extremely excited
about the opportunity.  The company will
perform in two fantastic venues. The first venue is at Disney's Hollywood
Studios theme park in an 1100 seat theater, the dancers will be performing
new and original routines choreographed by the Setting the Barre faculty. The
dancers will be showcased in a dance convention with other studios from across
the country! The dancers have been working on these pieces all year. The second
venue is just as spectacular as the first; the dancers will be performing in
the parade at the Magic Kingdom theme park!  Maiya has learned
choreography from designated Disney choreographers and will join dancers from
across the country as they lead off the parade and develop lifelong friendships!
This daily parade is viewed by tens of thousands of people and it is a
great honor that they were asked to participate!  In addition, Maiya will participate in a
dance workshop with Disney choreographers where
she will learn dance routines used in Disney's stage shows around the world and
learn what it is like to be a professional dancer.
The second
opportunity is traveling as a member of the North Shore Swim Club's 12 and under
team to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to the International Swimming Hall of Fame to participate
in the Fort Lauderdale International Championships.  This annual swim meet sanctioned by USA
Swimming brings swimmers together from around the world including from Barbados
and Mexico. Maiya has already qualified for six events; 50, 100, 200 and 400
Freestyle and 50, 100 Backstroke. 
Maiya has
worked hard practicing five times a week in the pool and three days a week in
the studio for a total of 11.5 hours a week plus weekend swim meets and extra
ballet rehearsals since the fall. We would like all of her hard work to pay off
with her participation in these opportunities.
We are
asking for donations of any amount to make these trips a reality for
Maiya.  Thank you in advance for your
donations. We appreciate your help and will keep you updated on her trips.
Thank you,Staci & Victor

It will help me build great confidence and grow comfortable being in front of many people. I would love to have a chance to compete for the title of Miss New Hampshire, unfortunately money is a tight subject for me.

Every cent helps and in return I will try my hardest to give back whatever I can when the time comes. xoxo.

When girls are young they dream about being Miss USA but it seems like just a dream. However my dream is coming true! I have been selected as a contestant in the Miss Colorado Teen USA! This is the state level of this prestigious pageant system! My entire growing up I have been volunteering in the community. I have done everything from cleaning up the community to raising money for the 9/11 tragedy. For the past five years I have been volunteering at the elementary school where my mother works where I worked with special needs children as well as tutored first graders in math. This is where I truly realized my calling. I want to make a difference in the world one child at a time. Right now I am in college working toward my degree in elementary education. I will then work toward getting my masters degree in Child Pyschology. I feel like this pageant is a great opportunity to inspire girls to never think you are not good enough because I was born three and half months early and was not expected to live past a year. But here I am, 18 years old, and making my dreams come true. I want to inspire children of all ages and if I win this title I think that it will open upso many doors andopportunities to make that difference and inspire more girls around the country! So help me make that difference by contributing to my entry fee andgivingmethe chance to compete! Thank you to everyone!

My friend, Heather talked me into doing the Ms. Wheelchair Wisconsin pageant with her to advocate for people with disabilities..My motto is ""Individualized care, not cookie cutter care!"" My platform topic is each disabled person has the right to make decisions regarding their wants and needs without the fear of being treated the same as every other disabled person. We are all individuals! The pageant is in Menomonie, WI which is about four hours away so I need help with travel expenses(gas, hotel, and food). If I were to win I would be able to attend the National Pageant representing Wisconsin. I would also be able to do advocacy appearances across the state. I am really looking forward to this experience and would appreciate any amount of help I can get. Thank you for your help!

TUSCALOOSA, AL                                




Hi, I am Jessica Edwards, the daughter of Xavier and Diana Edwards. I am from Tuscaloosa, Alabama and currently a third year student at Troy University at its main campus in Troy, Alabama. I am heavily involved on campus as well as in the community of Troy, Alabama, but I am not here to glorify myself nor my credentials. I am ultimately here to raise money for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals as well as bring awareness to my platform that I will be advocating for so that I may be eligible to compete for Miss Troy University. My platform is entitled: C.H.I.L.D (Community Healing to Inspire Love and Development). I am extremely passionate about my platform because it emphasizes the importance of unity within our communities so that we may properly educate, love, and allow our youth to grow. Society has somehow diminished the loving character of our nation and has allowed our youth to develop their selves in a community that strips them from the beauty of their innocence. I've grown to realize that there are many children who face struggles that have the ability to affect their learning, their life, and their hearts. We, the community, should be doing something to heal this scar of hopelessness. I am a firm believer that it takes a village to raise a child. Let's work towards loving ourselves so that we will be able to genuinely love one another. In return we will unite, no matter our ethnicity, and allow our children to develop into the individuals they want to become no matter their circumstances. This platform will allow children to dream beyond the statistics that they may feel they are born into. The core goal is to one day transform my platform into an organization. Although all children are welcomed to participate,C.H.I.L.D will target children growing up in an unfortunate/low-income household. The first step will be for it to be implemented into elementary, middle, and highschools in the Pike County area of Troy, Alabama, but I know that with many prayers, motivation, and your help, that it will one day be a nation wide, world-renownednon-profit organization.The Miss Troy Pageant will take place Saturday, October 22nd, 2016. I am asking that all funds be donated on or before Friday, October 14th, 2016.It was necessary for me to create this account not only because I am in need of personal financial assistance to compete in this competition, but because Miss Troy serves as a preliminary pageant for Miss America, which serves as a goodwill ambassador for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. I thank each and every one of you all for taking the time to visit my account and for your heartfelt donations. I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise money for such an amazing charity. I am also grateful to have the opportunity to learn more about myself as I step leap into this new journey. I do not take lightly the time, donations, or love from you all. Thank you, thank you, and thank you forever. ""Giving a lot is not what makes the amount enough, it's giving from the heart thatdoes.""

""Life is a succession of moments, to live each one is to succeed."" -Corita Kent. I found this quote as a senior in high school and for me it really resonated what my life is like with horses. Horses are my passion and my life, as well as the sport of Eventing. As long as I can remember, I've always had big dreams of riding around the amazing courses of Rolex, Badminton, Burghley, and most of all making a team and representing the United States of America. I've had some amazing moments which in turn have allowed me to succeed. I attained that life long goal of competing at the Rolex Kentucky CCI****, not only once but twice!! It still feels so surreal to even think it happened let alone that we did so well (top finishing rookie in 2015 placing 17th and in 2016 finishing in the top TEN placing 8th) To my amazement I then was named as an alternate for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Jinero, Brazil. While, I'm so proud of my horse and our accomplishments, there is a little part of me that is still dissapointed that we didn't make the team. But that is why I love Corita Kent's quote because it's always given me perspective, a way to stay positive, and a way to keep moving forward. In order to succeed and one day being named ON THE TEAM, I need to set my next goal. That next goal is the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials CCI**** in Lincolnshire, England during the first week of September 2016. Simply Priceless (aka 'Johnny') is a 15yo 16.3 dark brown/black off the track Australian Thoroughbred gelding. He is the epitome of the Three Day Event horse, athletic, brave, and has an amazing heart. While our partnership began in 2013, it has been a long three years of building a relationship. He was a horse that was so closed off and in a shell. It was very difficult to get him to connect to me. It's hard to explain, but with horses there is a connection of energy that you can tap into and communicate with them. So this took time. We had to work together on building the relationship of trust through consistancy in training. For us, the cross country has always been the best part, we both LOVE it. The dressage and showjumping on the other hand has been a work in progress and now I'm so proud of the horse Johnny has become. I know he can be competitive and beat the best of the best. The love I have for Johnny is unmeasurable, and to me he is certainly his name sake. He has helped me accomplish so many amazing goals and I feel as if we are just getting started.In 2015, we were named to the National High Performance Training List, and were awarded the USEF Land Rover grant to represent the USA in England at the 2015 Blenheim Palace CCI***International Horse Trials. This was an amazing opportunity, as traveling abroad with your horse is not a cheap endeavor, and by aqcuiring the grant I was able to do so. Not only did it feel incredible to represent the US (not on a formal team but still cool!), but it also allowed me to gain experience traveling abroad and competing against the best. International experience is vital if I am going to compete successfully on the world stage, and accomplish my life long goal of making the United States Equestrian team. Unfortunately, this year I was not able to attain a grant in order to attend Burghly Horse Trials CCI****, however, I am listed as first alternate should any of the other recipients decline. But time is running out and I can not depend on the ""possibility"" of the grant. It is a expensive venture- flights for horse and humans, veterinary care(making sure my horse is in top form), accomadations, and transportation will roughly be around $30,000 +. I have one third of that already due to the support of some amazing people. I am so thankful to my super supportive syndicate owners, Vicki and Steve Sukup, and Susan Day as well as all of my many sponsors for generously assisting me with the products and equipment that help me attain my life long goals, as well as to my family, friends, and many other supporters. Taking that into account, I am hoping to raise enough money that Johnny and I can attend Burghley. Not only attend but also be successful.  Competition at Burghley will not be possible without your help. Please donate in support of Johnny and me as we take this significant step towards a ""succession of moments"" and one day realizing our dream of joining Team USA.#GoJohnnyGo

                        Hi Everyone! Im originally from Dallas, Texas. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin where I studied Human Development & Family Sciences. Hook Em Horns! Like many graduates fresh out of college I wasnt sure what my next step would be. It wasnt after much deliberation that I decided to take a leap of faith and move to Houston, Texas and now I am in love with this city and my new job as a nursing assistant at Ben Taub Hospital.I must admit it wasnt easy to land my current job but my schooling and most importantly my perseverance were essential when I was job hunting. With that being said, I now hope to go return back to school to start Nursing school in the fall. I also decided to set another goal for myself which is compete in Miss Texas USA. At a very young age I would see pageants and I would think to myself that they all look the same. They are almost the same height and body type and that is something I want to change in the pageant world. If plus-sized models now are making coveted Sport Illustration covers why cant someone with a curvy and voluptuous figure compete AND win a Miss USA pageant? I want to set the stage for future young girls who want to compete in pageants that dont necessarily have the pageant look. Our Nation is filled with hundreds of beautiful, distinct and different young girls that are not being represented. That being said, I appreciate your time for reading this and your donations.

In August my hard work paid off whenI competed in the Tampa Pro Extravaganza and won 1st place in Figure Novice over 40, class E, two weeks later I qualified tocompete atMaster's Nationals 2016. I finishedthe season withthe goal of taking my body to new heights in the upcoming year.Training began again in Jan of this year andI was strictly focused on competing in Master's Nationals. My dream came true when i placed Top10 in Figure over 45 Class E.I am excited about my upcomingshow but competing can be very costly. Donated funds will help cover plane fare, competition entry fees, hotel accommodations, hair/make-up and transportation costs.Any and all dontations are greatlyappreciated!Thank you for the support...

                        I'm running a Half Marathon (13.1 miles) on July 4th,dedicated toJoe Danger. This is part of my personal contribution to the greater fundraising effort for Joe. I'm asking you to support me and support Joe - or even better, join us at the finish line!Just days before Joe got sick, we talked about training for our next Half Marathon together. Little did I know, we'd soon be embarking on a marathon for life  Joes life. Joe fell ill and was taken to the ER on March 6th and subsequently admitted into ICU where heslippedinto a deep coma for over 5 weeks. ThecauseofJoe's illness and coma wasamystery and required massive amounts of medications and steroids to reverse inflammation to hisbrain, which was causing severe brain damage.While the cause of illness still largely remains a mystery, doctors came to a consensus that Joe's immune system had overreacted, turned against his own bodyand began attacking his brain. The combination of medications and the severity of brain damage made Joes prognosis and recovery grim and unpredictable.We didnt give up. Ive been with Joe every day and every step of the way. I can't imagine not being right here with him. With an amazing support system around us, I took on each new day with a view of seeing progress; seeing recovery; getting Joe back.The hard work is paying off. At the time of thiswriting(5/13), Joe is on his 70th day of hospitalization, making asteady, butvery slow recovery. Although Joe has no use of his legs, hisarm movements are limited, he's weak overall and has a mountain of challenges still ahead  both physical and financial  Im happy and proud to say JOE IS BACK! I see Joes smile, personality, sense of humor, passion, tenacity, love and spirit. I see Joe.As a way to take care of myself during this ordeal, I put a focus on running several days a week. I thought it appropriate to run a Half Marathon in Joes honor and invite any and all to join me. You can run or walk, just forge ahead for Joe. Slow and steady wins the race! With some luck, Joe may just be at the finish line, cheering us on. You couldnt dream of a bigger fan.If youd like to register for this Half Marathon run/walk, or start your own fundraising campaign for Joe, please reach out to me for help getting started. The more people on Team Danger, the better! GO JOE GO!!!

We participate in four skill areas - interview, introduction, presentation in evening wear and talent. I won the Pennsylvania Miss Amazing in the Teen division. Now I qualify for the National Miss Amazing. The National Miss Amazing slogan is 'QUEEN TODAY, LEADERS TOMORROW'. The national Miss Amazing will offer me valuable opportunities to set higher expectations for me to become stronger and more determined. I have the honor of representing girls and women in my fine state of Pennsylvania. I am reaching out to you to see if you can help support me throughout this journey at the 2016 National Miss Amazing eventin June 2016 in Chicago . By supporting me you will provide me with the platform to show the world that I am an ambitious, capable and multi-faceted individual.

My name is Rohan Mallya, vice president of FRC Team 1257 Parallel Universe, my high school's (Union County Vocational-Technical Schools, New Jersey) robotics team. My team participates in the annual FIRST Robotics Competition, which is an amazing combination of robotics and sporting. For more information about what this is, you can check the website:  http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc

Here's the team's website to learn more about our team: http://team1257.org/ Being on the team has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. Not only have I learned various computer and engineering skills, but I've also gained experiences in business, teamwork, and communication. Being on the team has provided many real-life experiences; for example, the team must acquire its own funds through fundraising and getting sponsors.When I first joined the team, it was much smaller and less active. However, during my four years on it, it has met great competitive success and has been growing in size and productivity. For example, we've recently started conducting STEM outreach events to help spread interest in STEM education. At many of our competitions in the past few years, we've made it to the playoffs, made it to the finals, or even won.This year has been one of the best years yet. We won our first competition at the Mt. Olive district competition and made it to the finals at the Bridgewater-Raritan district competition. Achievements at each competition earnyou district points, and we accumulated enough points that we were invited to the MAR Regional Championships (4/14/16 - 4/16/16). There, though there was some tough competition, we actually won. Because of this amazing acheivement, we are invited to attend the FRC World Championship (4/27/16 - 4/30/16). However, with this success and growth, the costs of maintaining and running the team have been rising, most notably in transportation costs.While our school is ableto provide busing to competitions close to us, transportation to St. Louis for theWorld Championships ismuch more expensive. The cost of travel and lodging for the event is a barrier to participation for many of our team members, especially with less than a month to go before the competition begins. Although our school has given us a lotof support, they can't coverall of the costs for the team to travel such a far distance to St. Louis. We are considering the possibility that students and parents may have to pay full ticket costs in order to attend the World Championships. Many key members on the team will be unable to come if this is the case.Both the team and I would be incredibly gratefulif you could help us fund transportation to the World Championship. This way, we can continue to inspire my teammates now and in the future and have amazing experiences at the competitions.

Hello! I'm Alicia Dalton-Tingler. On April 9, 2016, I competed in Charleston, WV and won the title of Mrs. West Virginia America 2016.  Married female West Virginia residents age 18 or older competed in interview, opening number, swimsuit, evening gown, and on-stage question categories.  Judges representing the fields of beauty, fashion, business, media, and the arts were searching for a married woman who possessed beauty, poise, personality, and the ability to be articulate not only about her state, but also about her charity platform and herself.  This state-level pageant is the official preliminary to Mrs. America, the first and foremost pageant for married women in the country.  I will travel to Las Vegas, NV in late August to compete for the Mrs. America crown.  Fundraising efforts are underway to assist with expenses associated with this journey, starting with an online Facebook auction, t-shirt sale, and this GoFundMe.com initiative.I will spend the summer preparing for Nationals and the next year proudly representing my title throughout West Virginia.  I will make appearances promoting the Mrs. West Virginia America organization and myplatform of ""Giving-What-You-Can"" through the United Way.  Ihave volunteered with the United Way of Monongalia and Preston Counties for nearly a decade and found it to be the perfect platform to give back to mycommunity.  I am passionate about using my skills and strengths to benefit the counties where I live and work.  I am a Preston County resident who takes great pride in the strong sense of community found in the Mountain State.Please consider supporting meon myjourney to Mrs. America. All donations are greatly appreciated!To keep informed of upcoming fundraising events, follow meon Facebook at Alicia DT,  https://www.facebook.com/DTARDT.

SCOTT DEPOT, WV                                





                        MY JOURNEYIm Tracie Johns and this is my fitness journey:For as long as I can remember I wanted to be fit, thin and healthy. Ive struggled with weight ever since high school. With aspirations of changing the way I looked and gaining my ideal body I tried all the fad diets. Id stick it out a month or so only to fall back off track. After committing to my current routine for over a year, the most important lesson Ive learned is that maintaining a fit and healthy life is not something you obtain from going on a diet, but is an award only achieved through a complete lifestyle change.My transformation began with my eating choices and light exercise. When I started seeing some results they became my motivation and certainly increased my joy in the journey. My lifestyle went from going home after work, sitting on the couch in front of the TV unconsciously snacking, to leaving work, going straight to the gym, busting my butt, and giving it all I have. Ive since lost 85lbs and reduced my health risks considerably. Now that you see where I am, please allow me to share with you how it all beganMy husband and I desperately longed to give my daughter a sibling. We tried for many years but rested in the comfort that it just wasnt in Gods grand plan for our lives. With this disappointment I was also struggling with being overweight and having additional, female medical issues; furthermore, I also had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, fatigue, and I just felt plain miserable. Because of the above issues, my doctor decided I needed to have a hysterectomy. All my hopes and dreams of having another little girl or boy had come to a definite end. This was a huge wake-up call for me: I needed to put my health first.Needless to say my husband and I were devastated. Some days it is still really hard for me, but I put my faith in God and realize that the journey Im on is one crafted by Him, additional motivation to take my health seriously. With much reluctance, and a firm grasp on my faith, I agreed to the doctors suggestion. This hysterectomy, the crushing of my dreams, was actually a blessing in disguise. My surgery lasted a total of 9 hours, involving a hysterectomy and colectomy, and with additional complications, I almost didnt make it through. But, had I not had my hysterectomy, my colon issues may have never been discovered. If left alone it could have burst causing major infection and possibly killing me. In addition to that, if Id gotten pregnant it could have resulted in the death of me and/or my baby. I thank God everyday that I am alive. I thank Him that I was given another chance to turn my life of lethargy into one of zeal. After a long recovery, involving eating lots of calories to build my blood levels back up, I topped out at 253 lbs.Weighing 253lbs definitely takes a toll on your body. My blood pressure was staying around 149/95 (with blood pressure meds), heart palpitations and chest pains. I went to the ER twice, which resulted in GERD and making an appointment with a cardiologist who then scheduled a stress test and recommended I see a pulmonologist for systems of sleep apnea. My stress test came back okay, but with concern I was put on a second blood pressure medicine. After doing a home test for sleep apnea they discovered I stopped breathing during the night. I was advised, at the age of 40, to start sleeping with an oxygen tank, at least until an in-house test could make a confirmed diagnosis. I felt awful about myself, knowing that what Id allowed my health to come to was ridiculous. I said to myself, right then, If I can get out of this without having to sleep with a CPAP machine, I am definitely going to make some changes. The test came back okay! Praise God!! The results concluded I only needed to elevate my head a little while sleeping until I could get some weight off.My best friend, and long time nail tech, Casey Liptrap, had already started her fitness journey. I think at this point she had lost 40lbs and was doing great. She was eating healthy, exercising and working with a trainer, Justin Smith. I wanted to know everything! How she ate, what she ate, what she did at the gym. The answer to these questions, Ive found, is you have to want it!! Until you want it, you will not be dedicated. There were so many times Id said I wanted to lose weight and I was going to do it. Id try and quit. But not this timeI started in June of 2013. Eating better and exercising at home on my treadmill. I lost a little and felt better but I knew that I needed more. I ask for Justins information from my friend and got in touch with him ASAP. Justin immediately started me on a regimen with him. My efforts were doing a little, but through Justins knowledge I quickly learned that although my at-home cardio was okay, I needed to mix it up! Incorporate weights with cardio! After working out with Justin a few times I decided that a couple times a week just wasnt enough. I started training with him multiple times a week and in addition, I incorporated workouts he designed for me on the days I wasnt side by side with him--listening to him motivating me through PRs and the times when I just wanted to call it a day and move on to my post workout protein shake.SmithFit training is the best thing that has happened to me. Justin and Katie have been a foundation for my transformation. Through Justins training and Katies food tips, I have totally transformed my body. Not sure of my current size but I know I have cleaned out my closet and have gotten rid of all 2X, 1X, XL, 18, 16, 14, and 12,s. Ill remind you, my beginning weight was 253lbs. I am now 168lbs! 85lbs lost, to never be found again, and more to follow! Off scale victories include: losing one blood pressure medicine COMPLETELY; off of GERD medicine; only on a half dose of my final blood pressure medicine; I feel better, look better and am overwhelmingly excited by my progress. Im actually eager to look at myself in the mirror now. I get excited to put together stylish outfits, even wearing heels now! My self-confidence has been low for as long as I can remember, but each day I gain a newer and better respect for myself and my appearance. Ive fought for this. Day in and day out. Resisting cravings, killing cardio, lifting heavy, and staying motivated.Thank you SmithFit Training for helping me achieve my goals! I continue to work with Justin twice a week and do additional workouts either him or Katie create for me. Katie and I do post-workout cardio and stretching together and are always talking about food! If I ever have a question I know I can ask either of them, and if they happen to not know the answer, they do what they can to find it out for me. From the moment I first met with Justin I have listened to his guidance and followed through 100 percent! Weve both been dedicated to one another and Im thankful for all that the Smiths have done to guide me to where I am. Im Tracie Johns and I love being a part of the SmithFit family!Oh! And watch out 150Im coming for you!UPDATE 4/24/15: now 43, weighing 155, closing in on my goal of 150, off all my meds, size 6/8WHERE I AM GOING: training for my first figure/physique competition slated for Oct 31, 2015. So excited but terrified at the same time but I want no regrets!! Wish me luck!! https://www.facebook.com/events/657295624393242UPDATE: 7/12/15 made the paper!


 http://www.wvgazette.com/article/20150712/GZ05/150719880 Thanks to all that have supported me on my journey. I will need continued support now more than ever!!Being in a competition can get very expensive. NPC card, suit, shoes, jewelry, tanning, teeth whitening, training, meal prep and travel.

Jeannette's Journey 2 WBFF World's,"$1,280 ","$5,000 ",Competitions," July 12, 2016",20,2,ORLANDO,FL,460000,,,"

ORLANDO, FL                                




Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GoFundMe page and my journey to WBFF World's! We are at the 10 day countdown and I NEED you guys more than ever now!For those who don't know me...my name is Jeannette McCoy, I have been a personal trainer for over 15 years. I am currently a WBFF Diva Fitness Pro. This year, on August 27, 2016, I will compete in the 2016 WBFF World's Show. I am excited!!!I am entering into this competition with mixed emotions...as some of you know, I was one of the PULSE survivors. That night was a night that changed my life forever. I was not prepared for what I saw that night, no one was. I think about the victims, the survivors, and thier familes on a daily basis. Sometimes I lay in bed unable to sleep...I still cry, I dont know when this will get easier. Honestly...I almost backed out of WBFF World's because I lost so much weight from being depressed...but my family and friends have encouraged me, and reminded me that I am strong and I should not let this defeat me...I AM strong...WE ARE STRONG. The overwealming support of our city has shown me that I can use what happened as a platform, to show that our city was hurt, but we banded together as #OrlandoStrong...and we will heal together, by encouraging and supporting each other.That is why I am dedicating this competiton to PULSE and the families by having a piece in my costume represent PULSE and the LGBT community. I have never asked for funds before, but I had to take time of off work to deal with so much. It's a process but I have to take it day by day.The money raised will be used for travel, hotel, the beautiful handmade costumes, and registration fees.I am so grateful in advance for anything you can donate. This means so much to me, because, this competition means more to me than it did before. It is my way of giving back to the LGBT community by representing US loud and proud and showing the world that we still have a heartbeat after PULSE. We are Strong. We are Loved.Thank you so much my friends for your support and the love that you have shown me already in so many ways. I plan on winning WBFF with your help! Thank you, thank you, Thank you!

                        Hello!I am excited to announce that I have been selected to compete in the Miss Colorado Pageant. The winners of Miss Colorado compete in the Miss USA pageant. I am honored by this opportunity!With your help, I am hoping to raise $2,000. This amount will help me pay for not only my entry fee, and board; but also, makeup, dresses, and other supplies.This March while competing at a World Cup in Uruguay, I re-tore my ACL ligament in my right knee. This was exactly a year from the first time I tore my ACL, competing against the same country, in the same venue, on the same mat, and, to top it off, on my birthday weekend.This experience devastated me, I knew (due to International Judo regulations) I no longer would have a shot at the 2016 Olympic Games. My heart was truly broken; the months that followed were the most depressing and directionless I have ever encountered.I am a very serious Christian; I do not (and did not) believe that God hurt me. I believe God allows things to happen in our lives to make us stronger, and with this attitude I intend to move forward with optimism!Ever since I was a little girl and saw Miss USA, I have secretly wanted to participate in a pageant. I am thrilled with this opportunity. It is my oasis in my recent desert. I am so Extremely thankful for any help anyone provides.Thank you for your support! And Thank you for taking time to read this :)

Last time is the charm? That's what I'm hoping. In 2011 ago I entered the pageant world without a clue of what I was getting myself into, but I quickly fell in love with pageantry and set my eyes on a big goal: Represent my home state of Maryland at the Miss USA pageant.The first year that I competed I had no clue what I was doing, but went out there and gave it my all. I didn't make the top 15, but I had such an amazing time and loved the process, so I decided on finals night that I would try again next year and work even harder.My second year competing I sought out a pageant coach, got a fancy gown, and worked even harder on my swimsuit physique so I could go out there and make my dream come true!I didn't make the top 15.After that second year I was devastated and wasn't sure if pageantry was for me. I worked my butt off and still wasn't recognized for it. Maybe I should just give up? But I knew I didn't want to deal with a lifetime of what ifs, so I dusted myself off and decided to compete again.Third times the charm right? My third year I worked even harder than the year prior. I got in the best shape I had ever been in, I bought a gown that made me feel like a queen, and I practiced my interview more than you could ever imagine. Fast forward to finals night: It finally happened! I made the top 15! While I didn't win the title that year, I truly felt like a winner. I had proof that all of my hard work was paying off and that gave me the drive to dig deeper and pull out the queen that I knew was inside of me!For my fourth year of competing, I temporarily moved to DC (where I was born) and gave that pageant a try. I knew that this would be my time to shine and take home the title. I got in the best shape of my life, bought a couture gown, and worked with my coaches more intensely than ever before. This was my year!It turns out it wasn't. I made the top 15, but did not even advance to the top 5, let alone win the title. Once again, I felt defeated. Was this really for me? Should I just give up? I considered it briefly, but I knew deep down inside that I simply couldn't throw in the towel.I dusted myself off and got ready for my fifth year of competing. I moved back home to Maryland and started preparing harder than ever! I did everything I could to make sure I left no stone unturned. I poured myself into getting ready for the pageant. I saw the gym more than I saw my family, I ate more chicken breasts and broccoli than you could imagine, and I worked with the best people in the pageant industry in an effort to become my best self and make my dream come true! All of my hard work paid off! While I did not win the title, I had the best interview I ever had, felt completely confident on stage, won Miss Photogenic, and made the top 5 for the first time! While I would have loved to have won the title last year, I still felt like a winner.I am entering my last year of eligibility for the pageant (it turns out you're over the hill after 26, lol), and this year I am doing everything in my power to fulfill that dream of representing Maryland at the Miss USA pageant.I believe that I have everything that it takes to become the next Miss Maryland USA and represent the state well at Miss USA, but it takes a village to achieve this dream, and I would like for you to be a part of my village.A donation to help me prepare for the competition would be greatly appreciated. No donation size is too small, and all donations would go directly to my preparations for the Miss Maryland USA pageant.What does that include?- Pageant entry fee- Coaches to help me prepare to the best of my abilitiy.- Fitness trainer to get me in the best shape of my life.- Wardrobe for competition (interview outfit, swimsuit, evening gown, and opening number outfit)- Head shots to make the best first impression possible.- Miscellaneouscosts such as hair, nails, makeup, and other things to ensure that I will be 100% ready for pageant weekend.Thank you so much for even considering donating, reading my long post (if you read it all, lol), and the years of support. It truly means the world to me. Let's win this together!With love,Chelsea

NEWPORT NEWS, VA                                





                        As many of you know, Paul Stephen has been competing in AAU Track and Field for the past four years. He qualified for the Junior Olympics his first season as a six year old, as well as during his second season. But that year, we opted to take him and Isaiah to the National Championships in Florida rather than to the Junior Olympics in Iowa. Last summer, he and Isaiah qualified for the Junior Olympics for the third year in a row. Because the games were in Norfolk, we relished the opportunity to have him compete and he turned in stellar performances; making the podium with a sixth place finish in the 800 meters and helping his 4 x 400 Meter Relay team win fourth place in the nation. This year, he has set an aggressive goal to medal in the Long Jump, the 800 Meter Race, and the 4 x 400 Meter Relay at the Junior Olympics. And his performances to date position him to do just that.Thus far this season, Paul Stephen has had some pretty amazing performances in the Long Jump. But none more exciting than when he achieved his personal best jump.On June 4, 2016, he jumped 13'2"" on his first attempt, and 12'9"" on his second jump, both far behind the board. So I told him ""we're only accepting PRs today and you only need ONE GOOD JUMP! So go and win this thing for me.""So what did he do? He sprinted down the runway and reeled off an incredible jump of 15'1""!!! The look on his face when he heard his distancewas PRICELESS.On June 11, 2016, his jump of15' earned first place at the VA District Qualifier Meet!! And on June 18, 2016, Paul Stephen earned Gold Medals in the Long Jump (15'1"" again), the 100 Meter Dash (14.09 seconds), and the 400 Meter Dash (103.94); positioning himself to run his best races at the Regional Qualifier Meet for the Junior Olympics.At the start of this season, we had no intentions of Paul Stephen competing in this year's Junior Olympic Games in Houston.And then three weeks into the season, he ran a blistering time in the 400 Meter Dash, along with four of his teammates. Immediately after the race, Paul Stephen's coach turned to usand said . . . ""You better start making plans for Houston."" As his parents, we knew that we had to support his goals, so we're saving for all of the travel, lodging, and meal expenses for Paul Stephen's attempt to medal in multiple events at the Junior Olympics. But wecan't do it alone. Your support, of any amount, will help to defray the costs of his participation this summer.Paul Stephen, Isaiah, Kim, and I thank you in advance for supporting Paul Stephen's efforts.

                        It's been almost 2 years since Ashley competed on stage. During those 2 years she has battled an invisible illness that many never would have suspected this vivacious, outgoing young woman to become afflicted with. It has taken time, support and a team of professionals to help Ashley navigate the world of anxiety & depression. It is still a battle she fights everyday but she is now mentally stronger, more confident and ready to take on the world again...or at least the pageant world that is.Ashley has decided to enter the prestigious Miss Colorado Teen USA competition scheduled for late October. While some may view this as just another pageant for a girl who has competed many times, for Ashley this particular pageant symbolizes much more. It is a symbol of victory. Victory that she isn't letting her illness define her and is taking charge in enjoying the activities she used to love. Victory in giving herself a platform to help other teens struggling to conquer the world of anxiety & depression. By getting on stage again and being vulnerable in personal interview, she is showing the world that she is not defined by her illness and that there is hope for those who struggle with feelings hopelessness.The journey to Miss Colorado Teen USA is one that we are asking you to join us for. Whether it means sending her words of encouragement, keeping her in your prayers, personally contributing to her financial goals or helping spread the word to others who may be interested in sponsoring, we look forward to sharing this experience with you.Above all else, know that win or lose, she HAS already won. To watch your child suffer and struggle to function day to day is an absolutely devastating experience. While Ashley was willing to receive help and face her struggles head on, many suffer in silence. A pageant title may not seem like much, but the doors it can open to allow titleholders to speak out and make a difference is worth every dime that's invested if the message is heard and just one life can be positively affected.Thank you for your support, now let's get #TeamAshley ready to shine!

                        I am excited to announce that I will be returning to Long Beach in December to compete at Miss California USA in hopes of capturing the crown to make it to the Miss USA stage!Last year, I competed at Miss California USA and placed in the Top 20 out of over one hundred beautiful women! It was an honor and an amazing year. Competing can becoming rather expensive, so I will be covering other major expenses out of pocket and I am looking for sponsors to help me achieve my dream of becoming Miss California USA.For those of you who may not know much about myself, I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Merced. I graduated with a dual bachelor's degree in political science and economics in addition to a minor in psychology while also serving as the University's first female student body president. While serving in my role as president, I dedicated time traveling to Washington D.C. and Sacramento to speak with legislators and advocate to keep higher education accessible/ affordable. These experiences inspired me to pursue work at the California State Capitol where I am working in the California State Senate.At the prime age of 16 years old, I joined my first pageant in hopes of breaking out of my shy shell. Through pageantry I have gained lifelong friendships and have invaluable experiences. I have had the opportunity to speak at elementary schools and work with organizations such as Girl's Inc which inspires all girls to be strong, smart, and bold. Through pageants I have been given a larger platform to promote Womens Empowerment and encourage women to take on leadership roles in various approaches. That's what I call beauty with a purpose! Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for being willing to invest in my dream! Even if you are not able to make a financial contribution, any support is greatly appreciated.With Love,Domonique D. Jones

UPPER MARLBORO, MD                                





                        My name is Tyreese R. Woulard McAllister; I am leading a campaign for Shaw University Alumni Queen 2015. I graduated Cum Laude from Shaw University in 1990 with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Business Management and a minor in Public Administration. While attending Shaw University, I pledged Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., and served two years as the Financial Secretary of my beloved Alpha Rho Chapter. I was also Junior Class President, and Senior Class Vice President. I went on to earn a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology from the University of the District of Columbia in 1996. I received a post-masters certificate in Addictions Counseling from Johns Hopkins University and am now pursuing a Doctorate in Forensic Psychology. I am employed as the Director of Emergency Mental Health System and a Hostage Negotiator. While I have gone on to further my education, I attribute the tremendous amount of career success and satisfaction, to my earlier years Shaw University.Shaw University was founded in 1865 as an institution of higher learning for African Americans. Today Shaw University hails as a culturally diverse institution that continues to produce leaders in the twenty-first century.ShawUniversityhas lived up to its administrative motto:Strides to Excellence, Only the Best! In 2015, Shaw University will celebrate 150 years. This celebration of 150 years is bittersweet, because while Shaw University is making history as it has also been named as one of three historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that are at risk of closing their doors. Ten of the 11 HBCUs in North Carolina have seen enrollment drop this year, and include budget cuts that reduce its number of degree programs. HBCUs historically have smaller endowments and see fewer private donations when compared with traditional universities, making this campaign needed. Making your support of Shaw and other HBCU urgent.Several Shaw University alumni and other alumni of HBCUs have joined me to raise revenue and are doing their part by joining my campaign to ensure the sustainability of Shaw University. Raising money for our University is just as important as raising awareness about the plight of HBCUs. As you can imagine with lower enrollment, the universitys budget is suffering. The campaign for Alumni Queen is not only a fundraiser, but a concerted effort to increase awareness about the historical Shaw University and gain continuous support for Shaw University. It is my goal to raise $22,500.00. Although this may seem like a lofty goal for one individual, I believe that with your help, we can do it! I am simply asking 150 individuals to donate $150.00. To this end, I am requesting that you make a tax deductible contribution to this CAUSE. Why? Because Shaw U needs you! Because African American students need HBCUs! Because we cannot do it without you! Because its the right thing to do!While everyone will not be able to give at the rate of $150.00, any amount is truly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your tax deductable contribution and continued support.Sincerely,Tyreese R. Woulard McAllister

I am a model, Miss Faviana and Miss Malibu USA 2016.I believe that setting goals, hard work, and dedication can help you achieve your goals and dreams, but sometimes it takes a little more than that such as the finances to make it happen!I have worked hard during my high school and college careers, participating in leadership all 4 years of high school, as well as being on the Varsity Swim Team all 4 years of high school. I have attended my local community college, am part of the Phi Theta Kappa National Honors Society, and will be graduating with Honors next month! It has been tough to keep up my studies, pageant duties (including charitable & volunteer work), work as a lifeguard & swim instructor (prior to modeling), work as a model, and my internship with Faviana NY all while attending college! After working diligently, I found out last month that I was granted acceptance into Pepperdine University! Even though receiving a small grant and scholarship, the University is extremely expensive and beyond what myself or my parents are able to afford!I am also loving my reign as Miss Malibu USA and was so ecstatic to be a finalist in the Miss CA USA Pageant a few months ago. I would absolutely love to continue my pursuit of the Miss CA USA crown this coming December, but pageants are also extremely expensive, and with my educational expenses taking a priorty right now, I'm not sure it is possible for me to continue my pursuit of Miss CA and ultimately on to Miss USA!I have come to the realization that my friends and family might possibly be able to help me in the pursuit of my dreams.Interestingly, the deadline to enter the Miss CA USA Pageant (paid in full to receive judges remarks and mentoring) is May 1st, and my decision to enroll in Pepperdine including deposit is also May 1st!It would mean the world to me if any of you, no matter how small the donation, would be able to help and sponsor me in the pursuit of these dreams. If you believe in me and that I can accomplish these feats, please help me to do so if you are blessed in a way that you are able to.The money would be first used as a sponsorship for my Miss CA USA Pageant which includes the cost of the pageant, coaching/training, pageant wardrobe/gown etc... I love being a titleholder for the amazing goals it helps me to achieve and also to work with some amazing charities that I would not be able to otherwise in the same position. Miss CA USA would open up many more doors for me in both of these ways.Since I can not justify paying for a pageant with all of my education expenses, if the pageant was covered by sponsorships, I would then use the rest of the funds towards my education at Pepperdine if I'm so blessed to be able to attend there.I am still praying and hopeful we will find a way.I would be forever grateful and so appreciative if you feel led to be able to sponsor me for the Miss CA USA Pageant and allow me to continue my journey to Miss USA! I will not feel that I have to choose between my pageant and my education, buy may continue with both.Please respond today since I have May 1st deadlines to prepare for both reasons.Thank you so much for always being so supportive!!!Brooke Ashlynn Miller <3

The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hairTrue beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she knows.  Audrey HepburnHi everyone! My name is Reeva Darren Gestre. I am 20 years old and a sophomore at UCLA, majoring in Psychobiology and minoring in Theater. I am honored to bean official candidate for this year's Binibining Pilipinas USA pageant.I chose to enter this pageant not only to gain self-confidence, but more importantly promote the fact that beauty is more than what's on the surface--what we say, our actions,intentions, and thoughts need to be beautiful as well. The power that a pageant queen holds is extremely influential, and should be used to bring awareness to certain issues instead of simply displaying how charmingshe is. Becoming a part of this pageant will allow me to share my beliefs and represent the Filipino community in a positive light as I hope toinspireyoung Filipinos in realizing thatwe should be proud of who we are and where we come from.As a student attending a college that is 350 miles away from my home, I already struggle financially as is. My family has chosen to pay for the registrationfee, evening gown, national costume, hair and make-up, and much more; the only expense left is sponsorship. With that being said, I am asking for your help in sponsoring my advertisement and congratulatorypages in the souvenirbook. Every donation helps, no matter how big or how small it is. In return, I will include your name in the souvenir book.I know that I have been blessed with this opportunity and I hope to do my very best in showcasing the true beauty of being Filipino. Thank you so much for reading and supporting me on this journey.-Reeva Darren GestreBinibining Pilipinas USA Candidate #20

MISS TEEN RHODE ISLAND LATINA,"$1,090 ",$900 ,Competitions," June 16, 2016",22,3,PROVIDENCE,RI,432000,,3,"

PROVIDENCE, RI                                




Hello! My name is Diamond Rivera. I am a Hope High School graduate and will be attending Rhode Island College in the fall. I am 17 years old. I live in Providence, Rhode Island, and I am the reigning Miss Teen Rhode Island Latina 2016! Before I continue I would like to say that it is an honor to represent the Hispanic teenage population of our beautiful state and I plan to be involved in as much outreach and city engagement as possible to prove my dedication to us as a community. I am the representative of our Latin youth so I will definitely be INVOLVED with our Latin youth! Be on the look out for me in your area! I will [eventually] try to be there to introduce myself to as many people willing to meet me! All dates TBA. Although I represent Hispanic youth, I hope to become a positive role model for Rhode Island youth as a whole-- no matter their ethnic background. 


This July, on the 28th to the 1st of August, I was fortunate enough to be invited to fly to Kansas City in order to participate in the national pageant: Miss Teen Latina USA! It is not only an honor, but it is a dream come true. The expenses to make the dream a reality, unfortunately, are not so much a dream come true. From buying dresses, makeup, and coaching to be at my best come time of the pageant, the cost can add up. That's where you, my Rhode Island family, come in! 


If you feel in any way urged to donate ANY amount of funding to help aid me in my journey I would greatly appreciate it. Anything will help! The total that my team and I hope to reach is the minimum of $500-- the national pageant's fee of entry. It was originally $1000 but due to my recent crowning and the short amount of time I have to fund myself, as well as buy all things necessary to compete, the national's directors only require me to pay HALF by July 8th! July 8th is still a short deadline but I believe we can do it! 


Once again, all contributions are accepted no matter how small you think it may be. I will appreciate each donation and plan to make Latin Rhode Island proud as I walk the stage at nationals! 


If you would like to get to know me more before donating, or if you have any questions do not hesistate to add my Facebook: Diamond Rivera. You may also contact my mother, Sara Ferriere, and she will gladly answer your questions as well. 


Thank you for taking your time to read this request and if you decide to donate, I thank you very much! If not, thank you for still getting to know who I am by reading this short biography and I hope to meet you someday! 


Love,
Diamond Rivera
Miss Teen Rhode Island Latina 2016

Miss Wisconsin USA 2017,"$1,435 ","$2,500 ",Competitions," February 11, 2016",23,7,FREDERIC,WI,433000,1,41,"






                            Marissa Lynn
                            
                            
                                                           
FREDERIC, WI                                




A little about me:My name is Marissa Nelson and I am from Frederic, Wisconsin. I am currently attending graduate school at the University of Minnesota to obtain my Master's of Education.Background:I am reaching out with high hopes that you can help me in achieving a lifelong dream, that unfortunately is not possible on my own. Starting at the age of nine, I competed in my first Miss Wisconsin pageant. Out of around 40 girls, I placed Third Runner Up and was hooked. I met lifelong friends, gained a lot of confidence, and learned a lot of communication skills. As I got older, my parents got divorced and we could no longer financially afford pageants. I took a number of years off until I ran for Miss Frederic, and won, and went on to Miss Wisconsin Teen USA. (Miss Wisconsin Teen USA and Miss Wisconsin USA is the branch of pageantry owned by Donald Trump and the state winners are the women that go on to compete for Miss USA that is televised on national TV. Areas of competition include Interview, Swimsuit, and Evening gown.) My first year competing, I placed in the Top 15 out of 50 girls. The following year I begged local businesses to help me out and was blessed to compete again, placing as 4th runner up. That was the last year I was able to compete in the Teen division as I had aged up into the Miss division. I decided to take a few years off of competing in this branch of pageantry as it is such a cost commitment. I also made a commitment to myself that when I decided to compete again I would be able to give it my all, not only in preparation, but also in the reigning year if I was lucky enough to win. I am finally in that place in my life. I feel like this is my time! This is where you come in. I was hoping you and/or your business could help financially support me. Sponsorships:As far as sponsorships made by businesses go, I can advertise as much or as little as you choose. I have personal websites as well as a pageant devoted one where I have hundreds of followers. Your name would also be in the pageant book as well as on the official Miss Wisconsin USA website. Also, all sponsorship money is completely tax deductible and you would receive a receipt of that, regardless if it is a personal or business contribution. If you do not wish for me to advertise for you, that is completely alright as well. It would be a personal decision, completely up to you. I do not in any way expect any one person or business to completely financially back me, but every little bit helps.When and Where?Fond Du Lac, WisconsinSeptember 9-11, 2016Why am I competing?Although being crowned Miss Wisconsin USA has been a dream of mine since a very young age, there are many other reasons upon which holding this title is of upmost importance to me. One of the many reasons is because of the scholarship money provided to the winner. I have been financially independent for a large portion of my life, and although my education will help progress my future, it has also placed a large financial burden on me. Scholarship money is something I would be more than appreciative of, but the primary reason I want to be crowned Miss Wisconsin USA is because of the opportunities it would provide me in bettering my future; personally and pertaining to my career path. Upon winning the title, I would be able to attend a national leadership conference, all expenses paid. I would also be awarded communication sessions with nationally accredited coaches. In order to be successful in life, especially as a teacher and future principal, two primary skills you need to be proficient in are leadership and communication. Through these different opportunities, I would also meet many experienced professionals and could also foster many networking opportunities that would help progress me toward my future goals. As a graduate student, it is very obvious that I take my education and my career path very seriously. The reasoning behind that is because my biggest passion in life is children. I want to use my insight, past struggles, knowledge, and resources to give every child the set of skills they feel they need to succeed. I do not believe that I would be where I am today if there were not the select people that told me I could choose a different path than those around me, and that although it may be harder because of the limited resources I had available, it was still possible. I want to spread that word to other children, not only in our state, but throughout this country. Children do not get to choose the family or social class they were born into, and therefore I believe they should not be hindered by it. Some of the most inspiring people in my past were people that came from similar backgrounds to me and were able to break out of the cycle and pursue their dreams. I want all children to know that it is possible, and that they are loved, and they are important. I would love to spend my reigning year traveling around to various schools throughout the state and country helping share that message with youth.Why now?I believe this is the perfect time for me to compete for and win this pageant. Previous to this point, I have been constantly taking classes, student teaching, and working, with very little to no free time. Even though winning Miss Wisconsin USA was my biggest dream, I made a commitment to myself that I would not compete until I was able to give it my all; in the pageant preparation process as well as the reigning year that follows. Previous to this point, I do not believe that I could have sufficiently done that. I am at a point now where next fall I will be full time student teaching (normal working hours), and graduate with my Masters of Education degree in December 2016. From there, I plan to full time substitute teach and get hired on as a full time teacher for the 2017-2018 school year. This gives me a lot more freedom in not only time to prepare for this pageant, but also time to travel and make appearances and impact as many childrens lives as possible which is my ultimate goal. I believe that what you do with your reigning year and title is much more important that winning the title itself. I believe that this is my time!Where is the money going?The money raised will be used to help cover the cost of the entry fee and other costs associated with competing such as an interview outfit, opening number dress, competition swimsuit, and travel and hotel costs. I will also be using funds to help in preparations leading up to the pageant such as utilizing a pageant coach to help me be as prepared as possible as well as other preparation resources.                      I am very well aware that this is asking a lot and I thank you so much for your time and consideration.Thank you from the bottom of my heart,Marissa Nelson

                        Gear It Forward 2338 from Oswego, Illinois is a FIRST Robotics team composed of high school students from Oswego East High School and Oswego High School. We are raising funds to send our team to compete at the 2016 World Championships FRC(FIRSTRobotics Competition) April 28-30,2016.FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international program that was founded in 1989 to motivate young people to pursue education and opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). In the past 9 years, our team has grown from 12 students to over 99 starting the 2014-15 season. We are overjoyed with the increased interest in our team; however it has come with some growing pains. The best solution to ensure all members would have hands on time building the robot was to start 3FTC (FIRSTTechnical Challenge) teams.New students to the program would learn mechanical, engineering, and electrical fundamentals only on a smaller scale FTC team. Once they complete a FTC season, they will be eligible to join the larger FRC team. We set a goal to raise the funds necessary to put these teams in place during the 2014-15 season and we are very proud to say we raised the $6500 we needed. Over 30 students are now participating in these 3 new teams.About our team:Gear It Forward is extremely active in our community. We mentor our younger robotics teams within the district and plan outreach events to spread the story of FIRST to a wider audience. Our most recent success was the 2nd annual Kane County Cougars Robotics Game. Over 6,000 people were in attendance. We were able to demonstrate multiple robots and educate attendees on how important STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) is to our society's future. *Kane County Cougars Robotics GameThis week, Gear it Forward won the Chairman's Award at the 2016 Midwest Regional. Last season, we also won the Chairman's Award at the 2015 Midwest Regional. The Chairman's award is the most prestegious award in FIRST; it honors the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the purpose and goals of FIRST. A winning Chairman's team is automatically qualified for the World Championships. Not only did we succeed with our community outreach, but in 2015 we built a robot that placed 4th at the World Championships! This win secured Gear it Forward's status as a world class team.*One of our Jr. FLL teams with student mentors at World ChampsionshipsOur students are diverse and well-rounded. 21% participate in athletics like football and track. Over 51% participate in other extracurricular activities such as band, choir, and academic clubs. We boast a 30 average ACT score compared to the state's average of 20.6. We also have an average GPA of 3.9 on a 4.0 scale compared to our district's average of 2.7. Astonishingly, 100% of Gear It Forward alumni have gone on to college compared to 65.9% nationally.We hope you consider supporting us in our fundraising goal. We have always strivedto not have students pay to participate in our program and we hope to continue that committment. All funds will go towards travel costs.

                        My name is Courtney Rivest and I am the daughter of Lea-Ann (Sibilia) and Paul Rivest of Agawam. I am currently a graduate student at Springfield College obtaining a Master of Science degree in Occupational Therapy. I have made Deans List every semester of my graduate program, currently holding a 3.896 cumulative GPA in my final semester. My career aspirations include working as a pediatric occupational therapist and obtaining a Post-Professional Doctorate in Occupational Therapy. While at Springfield College, I have been awarded the Distinguished Senior in Occupational Therapy Award, which is presented annually to a graduating student who has performed consistently well in the classroom. The award recipient is chosen by the professors in their individual department. I also received the PRIDE Award for Humanics Leader in Service, which honors a student who has consistently committed to serving humanity and working toward the pursuit of social justice, and who has made lifestyle and career decisions consistent with the values gained from community service experiences. Volunteering is extremely important to me, as I have supported the following organizations over the years: Autism Speaks, the Buddy Walk, Friends of the Homeless, KEVS Foundation, Locks of Love, Oxfams Hunger Banquet, Rays of Hope, Relay for Life, Special Olympics, and many more. I have also coordinated, led and advised an annual Alternative Spring Break trip through Springfield College since 2013, in which a group of students traveled to an area of the world to provide service to those in need, focusing primarily on children and families. The trips included Jamaica (2013), Guatemala (2014 & 2015) and Springfield, MA (2016). My most recent accomplishment was being selected as a State Finalist in the Miss Massachusetts USA pageant to be held this fall. This pageant system is one of the premier state pageants in the United States and I am proud to have been selected from among the hundreds of applicants that were processed. This kind of competition is an excellent experience, and will lead to many opportunities for my future. If I do become our state representative, I will have the opportunity to compete for the national title of MISS USA 2017! In addition, I will have the opportunity to provide community service to the people of Massachusetts, focusing on my platform, and being able to bring my services to Western Massachusetts. There is also an opportunity to receive scholarships to further my education.I am hoping that you will consider assisting me while gaining recognition for yourself by being one of my sponsors. The sponsorship is necessary to help defray the costs that I will incur in this endeavor. Any amount would be extremely helpful, and can be written off on your taxes as a personal marketing expense. If you decide to sponsor me during this journey, I will contact you individually in order to mail you a receipt for tax purposes. If you would rather donatewith a personal check, please contact me via email and I will be more than happy to arrange that with you.I sincerely hope you will choose to celebrate this event with me while receiving some valuable advertising and community exposure for yourself. Thank you for your time and consideration! Sincerely, Courtney Rivestcrivest@springfieldcollege.edu

                        Hello, my name is Alma Jam. The Vision of the Miss Africa USA Pageant is driven by the potential and capacity to empower African women who are a leaders, ambitious, savvy, and ready to take on responsibilities focused on changing the world around them. Each year, Miss Africa USA Pageant brings young women together to represent their countries and share their cultures with the rest of the world, celebrate the power of the African woman and foster sisterhood. The Mission of Miss Africa USA Pageant is to empower young women through Leadership and Community Service. My platform is Human Trafficking. Human trafficking is a form of modern slavery. In its simplest form, it is defined as the trade of humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery or forced labor. It happens everywhere and can affect anyone despite of race, color, religion, ethnic background, or gender. Your financial support will help me pay for competition expenses, travel, logging to successfully compete for Miss Africa USA in Washington DC in November and spread awareness of anti-human trafficking on a national level.The effects of human trafficking to the victims is beyond complete emotional and physical repair, however, I believe through awareness, fundraising, and education about this issue, the power to dramatically reduce the occurrences of such crimes and rehabilitate survivors to readjust and grow into supportive communities is possible.Thank you for your support. God bless you.

GREEN COVE SPRINGS, FL                                





                        Hi, my name is Bryanna, but everyone calls me Bree. I'd like to share a little about myself. I was born with an Omphalecele. That means that my stomach, liver and intestines are on the out side of my body. I had to have 19 surgical procedures to repair my body. One of the effects of an Omphalecele is missing limbs, so I was born without my right arm. Doctors told my mom several times that I would not be able to walk, talk, or just be a functioning member of society. I was in the NICU for 10 1/2 months after I was born. I was on a ventilator for 2 years and I was tube fed for 7 years.My mom has always said that I was her inspiration because after she got pregnant with me at 16, she decided to go to college and become a NICU nurse to be able to help families and babies just like us!Now, at 16, I am a honor roll student and I am greatly involved with my school. I am in Student Council, I'm Sophomore class Secretary, and I'm also the FBLA Vice-President. I'm even on the JV soccer team at my high school. I'm going to go into my junior year of high school as a full time dual enrollment student, planning to get my associates degree by the time I graduate high school.I am also looking forward to attending college one day and becoming a Journalist.Recently, I have been given the opportunity to be in the state pageant fom National American Miss(NAM). NAM is a pageant like no other. You gain poise, self-confidence, and valuable communication skills. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget. I did really well in this pageant and recieved first runner up! It was an amazing feeling! Now, because I got first runner up, I am eligible to go to Nationals.The main reason I joined this pageant was to inspire other girls to be proud of who they are. I wanted to be able to prove to everyone that I am proud of who I am and it's okay to not be perfect. Especially if they have a limb difference like me. If by doing this pageant I help at least one girl gain confidence or help her realize that she is beautiful, then it would mean all my hard work that goes into this would really be worth it!To be able to do this, I need YOUR help!So far, I have asked around to see who will be willing to sponsor me and I am starting things like car washes to help raise money. The cost of this is estimated to be about 3000. This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity and my mom and I both think this would be a fantastic experience. If you can donate ANY amount I would truly appreciate it. If you aren't in a position to donate, I ask you to please ""share"" this. Every dollar is one dollar closer to a dream coming true. Thank you so much for your time.

                        Hi everyone! My name is Caitlyn Johnson and I have been given the opportunity to participate in the Miss Tennessee Teen USA Pageant (Preliminary to Miss Teen USA). This is a new experience for me, but I'm super excited for this opportunity to meet new people and try something completely different! Part of the pageant requirements is that I raise a substantial sum for travel, my registration fees, gowns, and my platform. So every little bit helps! My platform for the pageant is going to be raising awareness for mental illnesses in foster children and any money that is unused from this campaign will be donated to the Chattanooga Area Foster and Adoptive Care Association. As many of you know, my family and I have had extensive interaction with the foster system and the children in it and I'd love to use this opportunity to raise awareness for those who get lost in the system. As I said before, every little bit helps! I'm super grateful to have been given this opportunity and I hope you'll be watching for me at the Miss Tennessee Teen USA Pageant in October!

I was born in The Democratic Republic ofCongo. My family came to the United States as refugees when I was 15. Idaho has been a great blessingto us. My dad, mom, two brothers and 3 sisters are truly blessed to be here in Idaho. I learned to speakEnglish quickly, graduated from high school and am currently in my Junior year, studying Health Sciencesat Boise State University. Attending the university has been made possible, foremost by the graceof God, the king and loving support of my family and the encouragement and support of friends andinstructors.Serving as Miss Idaho Intercontinental is a great privilege. Representing the beautiful state of Idaho isan amazing opportunity to advocate for those whose voice is not heard; those who sufferinjustice through bullying and abuse. I am committed to speak for those who cannot speak forthemselves in our local communities, states and around the world.This competition has provided me a pathway to partnering with community organizations; volunteering,developing skills and relationships, offering support to programs, building awareness of the communityand increasing my level of confidence in new and diverse environments. My thanks to the following whohave allowed me to work with them: St. Lukes Childrens Hospital, Women and Childrens Alliance,Boise State University, Ronald McDonald House, the VA Hospital and moreI hope you will help me get to the Miss Intercontinental USA Pageant this July in just 3 weeks.

Hello everyone,The time has come once again to ask for your help in making my dream come true. I am going to try to raise money for my final year withDCI World Championship Corps Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps. I age out this year and unfortunatley wont be able to do it another year after the summer of 2016.For those of you that do not know what Drum Corps is, it (DCI) is similar to marching band. It mainly consists of Brass Instruments, Percussion Instruments, and Color guard. There are many drum corps from all over the world that perform in competitions, parades, and festivals. These corps prepare a 10-12 minute marching show each year and participate in a summer tour that lasts for the entire summerI would like to kindly ask for your help in fulfilling my dream of being able to march my last year in such a fine organization. ANY amount of donation would be a huge contribution for me and for my family as I am attempting to pay for Camp fees, air travel, spring training, uniform fee, and tuition. Thank you all for taking the time to read and contribute to my musical endeavors.

A calling I've supressed for years has finally surfaced in a way that can't be denied. I've spent most of my professional career in public service and five years ago decided another way for me to serve was to become a teacher. Right now, education and teachers are under attack! Public schools are the cornerstone of this nation. Irealize it is time for me to step up and run for office because I can not stand by and watch the dismantling of our public education system. I will fight to improve the education system, strenthen the economy, provide adequate and affortable services to our veterans, and reform our criminal justice system. I have the creativity, compassion, experience, and integrity that is necessary for public office. However, this is completely a grassroots campaign and I need donations immediately. All donations will go to the printing and mailing of campaign materials along with the creation and hanging of signs. My first hurdle will be to win the primary this June 2016. Please support me with any amount you can so that I can be elected to represent my community in the Nevada State Assembly for District 5. I can not do this without you! I can not even express how thankful I am to know that kind individuals will support me. Please check out my website at  www.miller4thepeople.com*Please, if you are moved to make a donation of $100 or more, please DO NOT do it anonymously. According to NRS 294A.190, ""Anonymous contributions in excess of $100 are prohibited."" I will not be able to keep your donation.

                        Hello!My name is Alexandra Marguerite Curd and I am truly blessed to be the reigning Miss Black Ohio USA 2016! I could not be more excited for the marvelous opportunities ahead of me in the coming months and I am planning some incredibly exciting things for my reign!My platform, Redefining Justice: Reformation of the American Criminal Justice System, is one that touches me as a social scientist, as an African American woman, and as an American citizen.'The Land of the Free' has the largest imprisoned population in the world (743 per 100,000), far exceeding the incarceration rate of the country that comes in second (Russia, with 577 per 100, 000). According to Michelle Alexander in her critically acclaimed book 'The New Jim Crow', there are more African Americans represented in the criminal justice system today (including prison, parole and probation) than were held in bondage in 1850. Men and Women of color are incredibly over-represented in this system, seemingly due to the fact that areas where POC dwell are often over-policed and greatly lacking in resources and opportunity. Criminal justice reform is not only my platform, but I also aspire to have a career in criminal justice, hoping to do what I can to redefine what justice looks like in this country.As with any good thing, this road won't be easy (or free!), so any support you can offer me will be greatly appreciated! Any donation, no matter how large or small, can and will be utilized! All donations will be used for:-Fees and dues associated with pageant-Travel expenses during my reign andHotel expenses during Pageant Week-Hair and Makeup-Professional Photos-Pageant wardrobe which includes: Evening Gowns, Fitness wear, and outfits for other portions of the pageant.-Wardrobe for apperances including: Suits, dresses, shoes and other accessoriesIf you own or work for a company that is interested in supporting me by purchasing an ad in the lovely Black Royalty magazine, feel free to send me an email.Also, if you would like to donate any products or any of the items listed above that would be wonderful as well!Thank you so much in advance for your support in this wonderful journey!Alexandra Marguerite CurdMiss Black Ohio USA 2016missblackohio2016@gmail.comFacebook: Miss Black Ohio 2016

                        In September 2015, 23 year old student, Fred Robertson, walked into a personal development class that would change his life forever. The instructor of this particular class was Mr. Jeffrey Azan and he was teaching the principle of ""Chasing your Dream.""Once the class was over, Fred went up to Mr. Azan and introduced himself, following up with, ""...from this day forward I am your mentee. How do i achieve my dream of being a world class Motivational Speaker?"" Mr. Azan simply replied, ""You start by joining Toastmasters.""The following October Fred joined the Pacesetters Toastmasters Club and has been working the program acidiously. He also entered the International Speech Competition, where he won at the Club Level, then the Area Level, then the National Level, and finally the District Level.He is now in a position to represent Jamaica and the Caribbean at the International stage in Washington DC, this August. But he needs your help to get him and his coach to the contest. Funds being raised will be going directly towards his Visa for travelling, Hotel reservations, plane tickets, conference registration and travel and food allowance. All of this needs to be paid up by August 1st, 2016.Having such an opportunity has hardened Fred's resolve to continue to walk the path that has opened up before him as he moves consistently towards his dream, Competing and potentially winning would open the flood gates for a young man, of a single mother, to step into his greatness.

                        Hi my name is Daisi Elizabeth Williams I am 21 year old dental assistant looking to make a change. On April 9, 2016 I was crowned the major state of Miss Pennsylvania U.S. Supranational. I am a 2013 graduate of Governor Mifflin High School and Berks Career and Technology Center in Dental Assisting. My dream is to make a change and promote the importance of proper dental hygiene and of course to become the new Miss U.S. Supranational. I will represent Pennsylvania at the Miss U.S. Supranational national pageant this summer June 20-25, 2016 in Orlando, Florida. The winner of the national pageant will represent the USA at Miss Supranational international pageant in Poland. As mentioned, I really want to promote the importance of proper dental care, because a healthy smile is a happy smile, and I definitely am able to show that through this modeling pageant.I hope to start a non profit organization to help and educate on the importance of proper dental care and to help those that can't necessarily afford it. I believe a beautiful smile reflects confidence and happiness. I keep busy in my community as a nursery teacher, Meals for Homeless, assisting with community outreaches and Kids Smiles. In my spare time I enjoy baking, reading, volunteering and making others happy. The greatest lesson I've learned is to never ever take life for granted, if you want to do something you go out and do it. I want to mentor youth and young adults that you can do anything you put your mind to, along with Gods help. Always follow your dreams. That is why I present to you my GoFundMe page, so I can follow my dreams. I'm asking for sponsorship/ donations that will go towards expenses to be able to compete at nationals this June.Thank you for the time taken to read my page and please consider helping me follow my dreams, even the slightest bit will help. The support would be greatly appreciated! Please do not hesitate to contact me for any questions! Or just getting to know me more:) Follow my journey on Facebook and instagramn.

                        Where do we start..Keifer is the most amazing kid we know! If your ever feeling down he is the one to lift you up..if not with his words then with his smile! He has the BEST smile..it can light up a room quicker than flipping a switch!  Now let me tell ya a little about our son...Keifer was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy at the age of 18 months..at that time the doctors told us that he would ""NEVER"" be able to walk! Well..little did they know that with this kids heart and determination he has overcome that and has made those doctors..shall I say..eat their words! Keifer has been through so much in his 13 years..from physical therapy to occupational therapy he has endured medications and Botox injections to even  several surgeries..the latest only being August 3rd of this year where even after this procedure he is back in a walker and back doing physical therapy trying to build his core strength and gain his balance. You see..Keifer's ultimate goal in life is to be free of ALL devices! NO walker, NO canes..NOTHING!! Keifer started Equine therapy in Flour Bluff for Glenoak Therapeutic Riding Center when he was only 4-5 years old and for the last 2 years he has been asked to attend the NSBA World Horse Show in Tulsa, OK where he has won reserved champion his first year and last year won and he is now 2 time EWD World Champion Walk/Trot and Western Pleasure.  This year we decided to for go Oklahoma and shoot for the stars..we are trying to get him to the 50 Golden Anniversary All American Quarter Horse Show ""Congress Horse Show""  in Columbus, OH and this is where you can help him and us get him there! It is quite costly to do this air fare, hotel, car rental, entry fees, food..etc. anything will help Keifer and us as a family get there to support him and cheer him on! Keifer NEVER ask for anything but this is ALL he is asking for..his love for horses is unbelievable (along with any other 4 legged critter) and we have to wonder just what God is up to! Keifer has always said that God is the reason he has gotten as far as he has because with him by his side he can accomplish ANYTHING..and you know what we truly believe that! This kiddo is a true inspiration to many and has a heart of gold..he is our Olympic Champion.. let's help him get to Ohio!

                        On January 1st, just like most people, I gave a lot of thought to how I want 2016 to be. Some of my goals are to run 3-4 times a week, meet new people, hike and travel to some beautiful places and most importantly stop making excuses when good opportunities come my way and step out of my comfort zone. This is why on September 3rd and 4th I will be competing in the Miss Montana USA competition which will be held in Missoula, MT. I've never been in a pageant before and I certainly don't consider myself the pageant ""type."" So why am I doing this? 1) this is a way to take a step out of my comfort zone and try something new, 2) pageants actually offer a lot of opportunities for personal and professional growth to young women, 3) public speaking terrifies me, so this is a chance to overcome that, 4) its a good reason to work on becoming the best version of me, physically and mentally, 5) I would love to work with more charities and become a role model for young girls in the community, and 6) secretly a part of me has always wanted to be in a pageant.Now all that I need is some help from great people like you! The amount I need to start this journey is $1194, itemized as follows:Entry fee: $699 (includes meals and hotel stay for the weekend of the pageant in Missoula)Swimsuit: $100 (mandatory order from there catalog) Mandatory Ticket Sales: $395 (pledging to buy a ticket from me for $25 for the show in Missoula would help cut down this cost!)Anything funded in addition to these costs would go towards purchasing an evening gown, interviews, hair/makeup and other important expenses!Every little bit helps including simple wishes of luck! Thank you all for hearing me out and for your support!!! Xoxo

                        Hi, I'm Ali Smith.Some people know me as Cinderella, LissyBoo, or even Officer. I play many different roles in my community, but Id like to add one more: Mrs. Utah, United States. The Mrs. Utah, United States pageant will be held on June 18, 2016, a preliminary to the national Mrs. United States pageant. As Mrs. Kaysville, it is an honor to represent my hometown. My platform is focused on mental illness. At this time, I am mainly focused on erasing the stigma of mental illness and increasing the amount of resources available to first responders. There is a crisis; Mentally ill people are calling for help and when police arrive on the scene it generally results in a human who honestly doesnt know any better ending up in jail. The cause of this is lack of funding for training and limited space in mental hospitals. I want to see the mentally ill getting the help they need; not feeling helpless and alone.A couple more titles I proudly hold are mother and wife. I have one son who is the sunshine of my life. After having my son, I had to leave my job as a reserve police officer. In the meantime, I got my Emergency Medical Technician license and hope to be a paramedic one day. I currently work as a Security Officer and EMT at a luxury hotel in Park City. There is an inner peace inside when I am helping others. I have seen firsthand the cause and effect mental illness can have on a person; however, I believe that with proper training and an increase in resources available to first responders, this can change!To me, Mrs. Utah is a leader and an example to every woman. If I am to become your next Mrs. Utah, I plan to promote and hold fundraisers for my platform, continue to support my charities, and represent the legacy that is Mrs. Utah. (Also, that Mrs. United States crown is calling my name!)This fundraising campaign is to assist me with pageant fees and competition expenses. I whole-heartedly, 100% appreciate the support of family, friends and the community as I begin this journey. Thank you for your support!!Best,Ali

In September we hosted an FTC tournament at Middleton High school, which allowed hundreds of students and parents see 16 local robotics teams in action. We visited Middle Schools to get them interested in robotics, and helped set up and build Lego 'missions' for younger students. We had members participate in a neighborhood cleanup thru Keep Tampa Bay Beautiful, and in addition to all of that, our team attended Roboticon, an event organized to showcase the FIRST robotics program to the public.About FIRST RoboticsFirst Website FIRST is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization devoted to helping young people discover and develop a passion for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

TANEYTOWN, MD                                





                        Hello, my name is Cheyanne Lynn Stonesifer. I have been accepted to be in the ""Miss Maryland USA Program""- the most biggest, famous, and televised pagent. But before I continue, I would like to share exactly why I want to compete...My mother has dwarfism standing at 4ft. 5 and my father is average height standing at 6ft. 2, and with dwarfism being 50/50 when having children.. my sister and I are both small stature as well. I am the smallest in the family, although that does not bring me down. I love my height on days that I struggle with ignorance, just as much as I do on days that I receive wonderful complimants. I am blessed to be little because it gives me the opportunity to share my experience to others who always ask why I am 20 years old, but am only 3 ft 10. When I am in public, someone is always staring at me or always asking me personal questions about my height. The one thing I always be sure to tell them is ""God made me this way. I am just like you, but smaller."" And I believe that is the best and easiest way to explain it, because God makes no mistakes.I would like to participate in the 2017 Miss USA Pagent, not because I have always wanted to be in a sparkling dress on a huge stage, but because I want to show everyone who watches, who I am. I want to show the audience that even though I am a dwarf, I can still do anything just as well as anyone average height can. I just want people who bring themselves down, to know that as long as their heart is beautiful, they are beautiful on the outside as well! And my goal is for them to look at me competing in a pagent; being the only little person, and still shining the best I can without letting my height stop me. I can do anything I set my heart and mind to, and so can anyone else!""The Miss Maryland USA program is not about encouraging young women to ""win"" a pageant, but to encourage young women to develop life skills that will ultimately help them win in life by being their personal best in everything they do.""The total cost to continue through with the Pagent is $995.00 total. It is divided in 3 sections. $332 due July 26th. $332 due August 26th. $331 due September 26th.The purpose for each contestant to raise money, is for it to cover the Pageant Orientation Seminar, the 3-day/ 2-night stay, lodging, meals, production/ printing/ advertising costs, prizes and awards, and of course sending the chosen Miss Maryland USA 2017 to the National MISS USA Pageant. -(Each contestant is required to bring it 1 or more coats for the Happy Helpers Charity for homeless)-. We were told that a great way to raise our sponsorshipsis to ask and show a flier to people and/or companies who can sponsor us within the next couple of months to reach our goal.Again, I hope you can help sponsor me. Thank you so very much and GOD BLESS

                        Hi friends!I have been fortunate enough to be selected again to compete this coming November for the prestigious title of Miss Maine USA 2017.As you may or may not know, I am a 25 year old licensed cosmetologist pursuing my passions in the beauty industry in downtown Portland. I am very lucky thatI have found my calling within my career. I absolutely love to make people feel beautiful! Helping others feel good about themselves both internally and externally is my main priority. I'm fortunate that between my job and advocating for mental health, I am able to do just that. My dreams have come to life through following my heart, which has lead to other roads and opportunities allowing me to focus on a subject that is very important to me.I have struggled with my anxiety and depression my entire life. I always felt isolated and misunderstood until I took it upon myself to get help, which allowed me to learn and understand myself and specifically how I tick. In the last year I have been diagnosed as bipolar ll. Though terrifying at first, this diagnosis has lead to a complete change in my entire perspective on life. I can say with 100% confidence, that I am now happier and healthier than ever and have finally found ways to survive and cope which I never could have fathomed before. To wake up gracious and thankful to be alive everyday is such a blessing that I will never take for granted again.I feel there is a huge negative stigma surrounding mental health, and people of all ages are terrified to even breach the topic. With this platform I am hoping to bring awareness and understanding to all mental illnesses, to abolish the taboo and to show others that you CAN balance it all. I have learned how to take care of myself both mentally and physically while also balancing my dream job and a personal life. To make a difference in just one person's life would mean the world to me. I'm very thankful to have the chance to make my voice heard and to talk about my passions openly and comfortably. Im thrilled to have to chance to combine my love of both inner and outer beauty. Pageantry has taught me that life truly is all about the path we chose to take. It's about being the happiest version of you, and learning how to do just that. It's taking care of yourself physically and mentally to present the healthiest and happiest version of you. For me, I will use this opportunity to be a voice for others struggling with mental health and to be a role model for men and women everywhere. Happiness is a journey and I'm really proud of mine! If you have the means, please donate! Any amount, no mater how small will assist me in getting back up on that stage again! MISS MAINE USA 2017 HERE WE COME!!! THANK YOU! Xoxo

He has an extensive background in both dance and fitness.While growing up an athlete he was always the most competitive person in the room. After being introduced to the dance fitness industry in 2013, he began to notice a natural competitive spirit between not only instructors, but the various brands in the industry. Was Nike better than Reebok? Did people enjoy Zumba instructors more than BeachBody or Les Mills instructors? Lets find out! Greg Fountain than came up with the idea of marrying both dance and fitness together, but without negating the natural competitive edge between the two. Instead he embraced it, and created an opportunity where instructors could form dance fitness crews of any style or genre, and be given a stage to lead a live dancing audience through their finely tuned routines in front of a celebrity judging panel. This is where we find out, who can rock a crowd, and who would be rewarded for their excellence! Not only are these dance fitness crews showcasing their finely tuned routines and dance moves, they are essentially leading a live dancing audience of fitness enthusiast. The possibilities for this event concept are endless. The more we raise the bar and challenge ourselves, the better events we put on and the better workout our attendees receive. We call that a Win-Win, and this is how the Who Can Rock Da Crowd Competition was born.With your help, we can allow the millions of dance and fitness enthusiast that are deprived of these experiences, to get a taste of Who Can Rock Da Crowd and the ""Improvement through Movement"" concept.What will we use your contributions for immediately?The Who Can Rock Da Crowd Finale is right around the corner!

The team won the Arkansas 5A South Jr. High Regional Quiz Bowl tournament this year and came in 3rd place in the state finals. Due to their continued success and multiple wins throughout the entire year, they have qualified to compete in the National Academic Compition in Chicago, Illinois this June. In able to take the entire team, we need help raising funds for travel, food and lodging expenses. The team hopes to also attend camp at Missouri Valley College in Marshall, Missouri from June 16-20. The team has participated in several fundraisers throughout the year, but we are still short by several thousand dollars. These children are intelligent and dedicated individuals who voluntarily stay after school 4-5 times a week to study and prepare for upcoming competitions. They continue to train even during the summer by attending camp and attending regular weekly practices. These kids represent the Watson Chapel School District and the Pine Bluff area in such a positive way, and we are asking for community support so that we can reward these children with a well earned trip to Nationals. Any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your support. Further information about the Watson Chapel Academic Team can be found on their official Facebook Page.  https://www.facebook.com/wcactMy name is Melanie Edwards, and my daughter is a member of the Jr. High team. Any money collected during this campaign will be donated directely to the Watson Chapel Academic Team. For verification of my involvement with this organization you may contact the Watson Chapel High School counselors office and ask for team sponsor Lois Chambless.

As we all know there are many activities to keep our young people busy whether it's at home or in the streets. I believe it's important to instill dreams, goal setting, values, poise, confidence, etiquette, public speaking in our kids at a very young age. Aside from the associations Bre already has from praise dancing, ballet, drill team, and her shower singing (lol), the Nat'l American Miss Pageant takes her experience to a whole new level !!! This allows this 6 year old LA/Compton young lady to understand that the sky is the limit!!! I am excited and thank God for her acceptance (I received a phone call today) into the pageant and is asking for any amount in SPONSORSHIP. There will be pictures and videos sent so you'll can keep up with her progress throughout the pageant. We thank you in advance for your SPONSORSHIP.PS- BRE WILL READ THE COMMENTS, SO PLEASE GIVE HER WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

                        Hello everyone!    As many of you may know, my name is Kayli Adams, I am 17 years old, going into my senior year at Tyngsborough High School.   Recently, I have ventured out by sending an application to the Miss Teen Massachusetts State Pageant Office. Normally, this is something I would never even dream of doing, but with the love and support from my friends, family, and others,I sent in my application. To make a long story short, I had an interview, and I'm incredibly humbled and blessed to be chosen to run for Miss Teen Massachusetts!   I want to run for Miss Teen Massachusetts for a few reasons. I would love to further my volunteering opportunities, and to be a role model for people of all ages. Being a role model means showing someone to be confident and happy with your real and true self. To be kind to anyone and everyone, and to never, ever judge. Beauty isn't a reflection of what you look like on the outside, but what shines from your soul inside. I also want to motivate young girlsto step out of their comfort zone, and do what makes them happy! To tell them not to do what is considered ""cool"" or ""popular"", to do what truly makes YOU happy. If you want something bad, go get it. Dont let the fear of rejection or being afraid get in the way, to push through it, and reach your goal! I have stepped out of my comfort zone, never in my life previously participating in modeling or pageants. This is a huge step for me. I am so excited for the memories and friends I'll make through this experience, and your donation would mean the world to me.   I've asked for your help by making a GoFundMe page. With the pageant, comes expenses. My high goal of $3,500 will be used towards pageant expenses.If the goal is exceeded by the date of November 20th, pageant day, the rest of the proceeds will be sent to local charities of my choice.Thank you all for your support, I greatly appreciate it! -Kayli Adams

Kiara Armstrong of Ruidoso Downs was recently selected to participate in the 2016 Miss Pre-Teen pageant competition that will take place on Sunday, July 24, 2016. Kiara learned of her acceptance into this year's competition when the pageant announced their selections following interviewing in the local Roswell area. Kiara submitted an application and took part in an interview session that was conducted by this year's Roswell Pageant Coordinator. 


Kiara will be competing for her share of thousands of dollars in prizes and specialty gifts that will be distributed to contestants. Kiara will be competing in the Miss Pre-Teen division, one of two divisions that will have young ladies ages of 7 through 20 competing in modeling routines, which include Casual Wear and Formal Wear. Most importantly, Kiara will display her personality and interviewing skills while interviewing with this year's judging panel.

Community businesses, organizations, and private individuals will assist Kiara in participating in this year's competition by becoming an official sponsor to her. Through sponsorship, each contestant receives all the necessary training, rehearsals, and financial support which will allow Kiara to become a very confident and well-prepared contestant in this year's Pageant.

                        Last year, I received a phone call from someone who I consider my sister. She told me about the 2015 Miss New York Teen USA pageant and encouraged me to apply. Having only a general idea of what it was, I thought it was too good to be true. After I filled out an application online, I received a phone call about a week later. We had a small phone interview, which suddenly led to an acceptance email. This is an opportunity to improve my communication and networking skills, build my self-esteem and my interpersonal skills, all of which will help me carry myself with more confidence. I am honored to be a part of such a prestigious event.After continuous hard work and preparation to become a contestant in the competition, January came around and i became sick with the flu. Unfortunately I was not able to compete in the 2015 competition, but this is a new year and I'm ready to prepare all over again. Ever since I was a little girl, playing dress up and being a princess was my thing. I always loved wearing crowns, heels and dresses. I was ""the princess"" in the house considering I was the only girl. As years went by, I began to enjoy riding dirt bikes and quads as if I was one of the guys and loved doing outdoor activities, but deep down inside, I was always a princess. I'm so excited to finally have the opportunity to really feel like one again. I grew up in Brooklyn and had many friends. I was always so happy and I never wanted to change anything about my life. When I was 14, I had to move to Long Island. Leaving all of my friends was one thing, but when I started high school, I became the target of bullying, both in person and online. As a result of all of this, I lost confidence in myself and who I was. This pageant will be an amazing opportunity to show young girls all over New York, and maybe even the nation, that no matter what other people say about you, you should never let them bring you down. To me this is more than just a pageant. It is also a way to raise awareness for bullying and help me gain and strengthen skills that I will use in the future. I want to show other girls that you cant let other peoples opinions ruin incredible chances you might have coming.Thank you for the unconditional love and support.

                        Born in Long Island and raised in Brooklyn, New York -model, actress, poet, speaker, writer, blogger, singer, and advocate, Ariel Laura Metayer is a young, well-known ,female role-model among the Haitian-American community. For seventeen years, Ariel was raised solely by her single-mother who has managed to groom her into an extraordinary young lady. In her adolescent years, her mother kept her heavily active within her church, community, school, and extra-curricular activities. At the age of 12, Ariel's love of writing and speech expanded allowing her to publish her poems in Barnes & Nobles. Ever since, she's discovered various talents that she has been able to sharpen. On December 2013, Ariel discovered the Haiti International Pageant System in which she participated and won the title as Miss Teen Haiti International 2014. Ariel credits God, her mother, International Christian School, and the most prominent people in her environment for contributing to her refinement of becoming the young lady that she is today. Throughout her life's journey she's experienced various trials and spontaneous victories. She considers herself to be blessed beyond compare and encourages others, ""to have faith in God, continue to acquire knowledge, and speak softly but allow your words to resonate."" In March of 2016, Ariel obtained the title of Miss Black Teen New York US Ambassador and developed the platform of ""Health & Wellness: Combating Obesity"", one of the most predominant and preventable disease that is densely attacking our Black and Latino community. Currently, Ariel is writing her very first childrens book and launching her humanitarian organization, A.M. Selima, but before she could achieve her endeavors she needs to acquire a sufficient amount of sponsorship funds. Currently, the cumulative amount for the Miss Black US Ambassador Pageant is $1,400; this is not including airfare, competitive attire (sports apparel, pageant gown, interview attire, and accessories), filmed experience, informative based cards, and a possible hotel accomodation. Collectively, this has summed up to nearly $4,170.With the pageant rapidly approaching ,from July 3rd to July 9th in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Ariel needs all the financial support that she could possibly attain in order for her to represent NY well as an intelligent, beautiful, and respected black teen advocate. If you are interested in learning more about Ariel or desire to contact her prior to donating, feel free to emailor forward her a message through the link provided below.If there be any additional donations, they will go towards her organization of choice and the funding towards her foundation. Your donations are very much appreciated and will not go unaware or to waste.Thank you in advance. http://ariellaurametayer.wix.com/arielschronicles#!contact/c2q4

Not only did she receive a top ten medal but she was hooked !!! She has worked so hard in the past 2 years taking acting and modeling classes. She has participated in any and all things possible , without having an agent , related to acting/modeling and even has begun singing . She is more determined than I could have ever imagined ! She recently began weekly classes in New Orleans and auditioned for a competition in LA in which her acting school will train the chosen students. Abigail was chosen to attend the competition in Los Angeles in June . She will compete in front of managers and agents and hopefully will take the next step of this journey thru this process. No matter what comes of this journey it is Abigail's journey and one she has chosen to make the most of each and every day . She loves the stage and I am so proud of her for working so hard towards her dream . I can not begin to thank everyone for always being so supportive of Abigail and know that Abigail will never take that support for granted. Please help Abigail in her journey by making a donation !

                        Hi!I've just been appointed Ms Oregon Senior America 2015! I'm hoping you can help me represent Oregon and compete in the Ms. Senior America 2015 pageant in Atlantic City, NJ in October.  This pageant is more than a ""beauty pageant"".  Senior America is a re-affirmation of life and self worth, of laughter and tears, of inner beauty and outward charm. It isa national, not-for-profit organization which presents the positive aspects of aging and acts as an educator. The Ms. Senior America Pageant allows us to celebrate the vitality of today's senior woman and to applaud her accomplishments in the community, state, and nation.  The national finalswill be held in Atlantic City, NJ in October 2015, and my cost will be $3000 (including the Ms. Oregon Senior America pageant cost). Every dollar you contribute will be one less dollar for me to pay from my already small single-woman savings.I was married for 30 years, and raised and homeschooled my four children (two are still living with me). During most of the past 35 years, I have also volunteered for many non-profit and political organizations, including being: Friendly Caller, Meals Deliverer for Volunteers of America, Newsletter Editor for several political and non-profits, Homeschool group Art Teacher, OR State Director for CWA, Legislaive Liaison for OR Mothers of America, Political Campaign Manager, lobbyist and graphic artist, Communications Director for four groups, ESL teacher for Los Los Nios Cuentan, and currently Baton Twirler for the Beat Goes On Marching Band and the One More Time Around Again Marching Band.I have fulfilled my dream for marrying and being a mother. And, now would like to accomplish another goal ... to show everyone that life doesn't end at 60, or after a divorce, that a woman can still be beautiful, energetic, healthy, and valuable to her community. I have passionately lived a full, exciting life, which was sometimes painful. But, my Lord has carried me through the rough times (and changes), and I am in a very happy place now, here in Happy Valley, Oregon. Things can change. But, life is great! Would you join me in celebrating this philosphy? ""Success is getting what you want.  But, happiness is liking what you get.""Would you please contribute to my goal of becoming the next Ms. Senior America? I would be deeply grateful if you did!Your contribution will help pay for:Ms. Oregon Senior America application feeMs. Senior America application feeEvening gown, costume & extrasAirline tickets & other transportationMealsPhotographyPrintingAppearances in Oregon costsLet's win at the national pageant.

Hi! My name is Janiyah Barnes I'm a girl scout daisy member, ballet, tap, baton, hip hop, and praise dancer, active member and a positive role model in my community. On July 30, 2016 I was crowned National American Miss Virginia Princess! oh how exciting! Since I won the title, I'm now invited to attend the National pageant in California in November where I will compete with other girls who won in their state for the national title. Even though I won a free airfare one way and to attend the National pageant, visit Disneyland, and Hollywood I still have other expenses that are not included. I have never been to California so I'm very excited to see a new city and state on the other side of the world! The funds will be used for gas and rental so that I can see the city while I'm there, food, souvenirs, additional contest entry fees, and most importantly the hotel stay for that entire week. Please help me reach my goal. I'm so excited, this will be a dream come true! Thank You

                        Hello! My name is Portia Fish and I need your help to achieve a dream of mine. I have been training in karate for 10 years and competing in sport karate for 7 years at the USA National KarateTournament. This year, I took gold and was able to secure my spot on the Jr. National Team for the 16-17 year old -53kg division. The team will be traveling to Ecuador in just one short month to compete in the 2016 Jr. Pan American Championships. I need your support to make it there. Your donations will bring my competition dreams into reality.Between the cost of flights, the hotel, and competition costs, I estimate that the trip will take about $5,500. Without the support of others, I will be forced to forfet the spot that I literally had to fight for. I put my heart and soul into training and competing and it would be devistating for me not to be able to go. Any donations, big or small will bring me one step closer to my dream to compete on the world level. Thank you in advance for your help!

                        I began competing in pageants when I was 13. My mom signed me up to compete because I was just a little shy peanut afraid to break out of her shell. 10 years later, I have been able to compete in prestigious state, national, and international pageants. I've been blessed with the opportunity to hold titles such as miss teen Belleza Latina international, miss central Massachusetts, and many runner up and semifinalists positions. I have been chosen numerous times as most photogenic and ""rostro hermoso"" in my most recent competition at miss Latin international. All of these competitions have solely been stepping stones and learning experiences to get me to my ultimate dream of becoming Miss Massachhsetts USA. In November of 2014, Iva from miss central mass gave me the opportunity of a lifetime to compete at the Mass USA state preliminary where I placed in the top 15 semifinalists and won most photogenic once again. After taking a year off, I'm more than ready to take on that stage one more time in hopes of becoming this years Massachusetts state titleholder. My main purpose in everything I do is to inspire others that NOTHING is impossible. I've heard every excuse in the book and people telling me I can't achieve certain goals because of my height, weight, age, nationality, everything you can think of. But look how far I've came! I want young girls to look at me and say, ""if she can do it, so can I"" and to be that motivational person to push others to shoot for the Galaxy, you'll at least land on a star I'm asking for your help to reach my goal. Pageants are expensive and require much more than just a pretty face. So much preparation goes into them and with your help I can get a little closer to getting and doing all things necessary to win. Donations will cover my 1300$ entrance fee, help me pay for my wardrobe, my personal training, and interview/walking/hair & makeup lessons. Thank you so much to everyone who believes in me! I sure hope I can make you even more proud of this little Chiquita banana -Roxanne

                        Hi my name is Brittany Pierce and I am representing Trinity, in the Miss North Carolina USA 2016 pageant. I grew up in a small town called Trinity, NC and it is the place that I will always call home. My platform consist of raising awareness about bullying because as a victim for six years I know what it feels like to be pushed and feel unworthy.My goal is to travel throughout all of North Carolina Schools and heighten awareness about bullying and to also train students, faculty and staff on how to identify it. Bullying has always been prevalent, but since the birth of technology, bullying has expanded in new unwanted areas. I personally conducted a new curriculm for the schools of North Carolina to potentially crack down on the bullying, violence and suicide cases. The point of this new invented program is to force not only faculty and staff but most importantly the students to be hands-on in the matter, identify, and help prevent it.  Education is imperative to have because when someone is bullied they are no longer focused on school but merely on their attacker which effects the outcome of their potential in order to be successful. My ambition is notonlyto obtain my Masters inBusiness AdministrationandPolitical Science but to also be an inspirational speaker to the nation on the behalf of anti-bullying. My ultimate goal is to see my program in all of the schools across the United States in an effort to not only bring awareness but to also help prevent it as well.  In order for me to compete in the Miss North Carolina USA pageant this yearIneed to raise $1200 for the entry fee. Everydollar counts and is greatly appreciated. This is also an opportunity for businesses to advertise theircomapny in the the program books that will be printed for thetwo-day special event. Help support my dream and journeyby donating today. The deadline is September 1st, 2015.

Help Adriel represent Hawaii Chess,"$1,130 ","$4,500 ",Competitions," June 14, 2016",15,3,KAILUA,HI,267000,,4,"

KAILUA, HI                                





                        Meet Adriel. He is a homeschooled 7th grader from Hawaii and the current Hawaii State Intermediate (7th-8th grade) Chess Champion. He has been playing chess since age 3 and competing in tournaments since age 6. As the intermediate champion, he has won the right to represent Hawaii in the 2016 National Barber Tournament of Champions ( http://barberchess.com/), where each state and the District of Columbia put up only one champion to represent them (except California which is allowed two champions). He has worked hard over the years to reach this level and is excited and nervous about the fierce competition he will face.2012 - Adriel's first USCF rated game ever, against grandmaster Timur Gareyev. Intimidating much?Adriel also comes from a large chess playing family. He and his twin brother Gabriel are the oldest of six, five of which play tournament chess. The twins and their next oldest brother Caleb (9) have been playing for years and between them have won multiple Hawaii state scholastic championships, however, they have never flown to the mainland for a national event. The Barber Tournament of Champions is hosted this year in Indianapolis and runs in tandem with a major 10-day event called the U.S. Open Chess Championship (this is where the grandmasters play). Our dream goal would be to raise enough funds to take Gabriel and Caleb to cheer Adriel on at the Barber, and also play in the U.S. Open themselves.2011 - Adriel (holding the big trophy) with his brothers, Gabriel (Adriel's twin, far left) and Caleb (far right). GOAL A: If we raise $4,500, one adult will accompany Adriel to play in the Barber Tournament and the U.S. OpenGOAL B: If we raise $6,000, one adult will accompany Adriel to play in the Barber Tournament, his twin Gabriel will come to cheer him on, and both twins will play in the U.S. OpenGOAL C: If we raise $7,500, one adult will accompany Adriel to play in the Barber Tournament, Gabriel and Caleb will come to cheer him on, and all three of them will play in the U.S. OpenThe funds will cover the cost of plane tickets to Indianapolis, hotel, food, and U.S. Open tournament entry fees. We will be raising funds offline as well and will update the gofundme page when each goal has been reached.

                                                The Klamath Coyotes FTC Robotics team needs your help to go to the World ChampionshipTournament in St. Louis, Missouri from April 26-30, 2016!Funds will be used to pay for tournament registration, travel costs for the 10 kids on the team, and robot parts.The Klamath Coyotes have been a FIRST team in the Klamath Basin for four years, including three years as a FIRST LEGO League (FLL) team, and this past year as a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team. We have ten members (six boys and four girls), two coaches, and three mentors. We come from several different schools, including Klamath Union High School, Ponderosa Middle School, and one of our members is homeschooled. Some of our highlights throughout the years have been winning first place at our FLL regional tournament for three years in a row and winning trophies at the state championship for our Project Presentation and for Teamwork. As a rookie FTC team in 2016, we have received the Rockwell Collins Innovate Award at our first FTC Qualifying Tournament and the Control Award at our Super-Qualifier Tournament. At the Oregon State Championship Tournament, we were a member of the State Champion Alliance (an alliance is a group of three teams whose robots compete together). At the Western Super-Regional Championship, we competed with teams from the 13 western states. We earned a 2nd place nod for the Control Award, but were selected as one of 24 teams to advance to the World Championship on the basis of our robot performance, which ranked 14th of the 72 teams present.Over the years we have incorporated FIRSTs core values into our lives by competing with Gracious Professionalism, sharing our experiences with the community to raise awareness of FIRST, and learning project management skills. We have learned how to speak publicly, create efficient designs, listen to each other, and accept all ideas while thinking strategically, working together, and solving problems. We plan to continue meeting over the summer for fundraising, community outreach, and to improve our skills. Last summer we raised money for our team by partnering with a local FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC) team to put on a week-long FLL camp for 40 kids ages 8-12. This summer we hope to hold another camp and learn about CAD and 3D printing.FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a program to introduce kids to STEM through robotics. The mission ofFIRSTis to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. More information about FIRST, FTC, and this year's competition can be found at  www.firstinspires.org.But, FIRSTisMore Than Robots.FIRSTparticipation is proven to encourage students to pursue education and careers in STEM-related fields, inspire them to become leaders and innovators, and enhance their 21stcentury work-life skills.We are excited to represent Klamath Falls and Oregon on a world stage in St. Louis. Thanks so much for your help!!!

ALBANY, NY                                





                        As I was filling out the application contemplating if I was good enough, if I could do it and if I had the body for it. Then I thought, God knew exactly what he was doing when he created me. This pageant is more than a crown to me. It is life changing opportunity and journey to only aspire for greatness. This is my chance to show case my size 10 body, my natural hair, and 5'10 physique. I have been chosen from many qualified applications throughout the state as an OFFICIAL STATE FINALIST in the 2016 MISS NEW YORK USA pageant. This is the first step on my journey that may lead me to the nationally televised MISS USA pageant as seen on NBC television and viewed by millions of people. Participating in this pageant requires a sponsorship fee of $1500. Contestants have been encouraged to request donations from family, friends and community businesses and leaders to meet this financial obligation and build communication skills. The sponsorship fee pays for: 1. My expenses during the 3-day, 2-night program, including food and lodging at the beautiful Renaissance Westchester & Performing Arts Center at Purchase College on January 15-17, 2016. 2. Gifts & prizes for MISS NEW YORK USA, finalist, semi-finalist and contestants. 3. Production of a beautiful stage presentation which includes professional equipment, sets, judges, emcees, technicians, entertainment and staff. 4. Round-trip airfare, wardrobe, and other expenses for the winner's two-week trip to the host city of the MISS USA pageant. Your donation and sponsorship is a huge part of my journey and is much appreciated. To achieve my dream it is only possible with your help and will give me the chance of a lifetime.

SUMMERVILLE, SC                                





                        Karla L. Correa - Morales was introduced to golf by her paternal grandpa Pepa at a tender age of 5. She experimented through the years but it wasn't until she turned 7 that she started taking classes, attending junior golf clinics withCoach Perry Green at Wescott Golf Course and showing interest in golfing. It's been about 2 years that Karla has fully embraced her passion for the game and is self motivated to practice so she can do well during tournaments. She's a newbie to the tournament world and seeks opportunities to improve her game as well as acquiring experiences of knowing other young golfers,visiting different courses and expanding her views of the game. Her goal was to make it to the US Kids Golf World Championship at Pinehurst, NC which will be from August 4th - 6th and to our surprised we received a special email with an invitation. Due to the nature of this sport it requires travel and funds for the fees and stay. We have invested everything we have to offer Karla the best chance at success to include but not limited to her equipment, lessons, tournaments fees, shoes, clothing, endless hours of practice, cheering and taking her to and from. I'm asking for you to partner with us, with any donation to help us make her dream possible. Outside the course Karla is well rounded student, an A honor roll student and recently won the Presidential award for Educational Excellence. She is a member of the LPGA Girls Golf of Charleston and The First Tee of Greater Charleston.Thanks in advance and blessings to you. Feel free to share with your friends and family. No donation is too small.

Miss Tourism Queen International is a HUGE pageant and I seriously can't believe that I'll be walking on that stage! It's so surreal.With this amazing opportunity comes a hefty price tag which is why I need some help. Here is a price breakdown of what I'll be needing help with:Entry Fee: $1,000Flight: $750Gown: $400Swimsuit: $50I know money doesn't grow on trees and we all work hard so a share would be just as appreciated!

                        Hi there! My name is Adrienne Morrin, your Miss Teen Michigan USA 2017 pageant contestant, chosen to represent Lambertville and Monroe County, MI. This year is going to take me places I have always dreamed of and it is fast becoming a reality for me as the pageant approaches ! I am honored and blessed beyond words, to have been selected to represent Lambertville, MI and Monroe County in competing for this amazing opportunity. This competition will be a moment I remember my entire life! :)My platform is to support my charity The American Association for Cancer Research. Both of my parents were challenged with Cancer during this past year and thankfully, by the grace of God and many prayers, they are both survivors A personal platform is inspiring teens with confidence. Being themselves and accepting of exactly who they are in their skin. Social media, TV and Hollywood portrays women as being perfect and puts pressure on young girls to look like something that is not realistic. I have created this account to help pay for travel, hotel, production wardrobe, finale tickets, makeup, hair, photos, coaching, sponsorship, advertising and entry fees. This is not just a donation to me, but a donation so I can make a positive impact in our community. The Miss Teen Michigan USA pageant is not what you see on TV. Its natural, age appropriate and family oriented. The pageant is based on inner beauty, as well as poise and presentation with an emphasis on the importance of self-confidence and a passion for charity work. I can make Michigan proud and make a difference, but I need your help. I am not just asking for your sponsorship to help me with expenses, Im asking for help in achieving a dream. Nothing is impossible with a willing heart.Thank you so much for your love and generous support. All of you, my friends and family members, mean the world to me!With love, Adrienne

                        I feel like I would be a great competitor in the Miss California USA pageant because I have a lot of life ambitions that I want to accomplish and I know that this pageant can help me get there! I have been extremely well-rounded from when I was a little girl up until now. I hold a First Degree Black Belt in Mixed Martial Arts, I'm a competitive golfer, my passion is Modeling/Acting, I enjoy snowboarding/snow skiing, my family is everything to me, I'm very artistic, and lastly I'm extremely musically oriented growing up playing Piano, Flute, Piccolo, Guitar and Drums. Speaking of snowboarding, earlier this year I had gotten myself into an accident where I had broken both of my ankles, both Tibia and Fibia, leaving me with 26 screws and a few plates to hold it all together. I found my new way of living in a wheelchair following 5 months after my accident. Then 2 months being on crutches after that, and let me tell you... I liked the wheelchair better that those bruising pieces of machinery. This traumatizng experience turned into the most humbling experience over the course of the recovery. I've learned things about myself and not only that but I have also recognized the motivation that lights the fire within me. I am very dedicated to my future and my well-being. I strongly believe in high and low frequencies and love surrounding myself with positive energies as I also project it. I want to create change in the world in the most positive of ways and change peoples lives of the less fortunate. I want to create a non-profit organization consisting of music festivals of ALL genres for the handicapped as I had broken both of my ankles (I can relate and have the UTMOST respect and don't believe that the handicapped community is given enough). I plan to graduate college with an Economics degree, as I plan to be an Entrepreneur. I plan to open a Drug Rehabilitation Center, to help those who have taken the next step in their sobriety and to change their lives in a positive way and to help them get back onto their feet inside the community that they once had felt ""lost"" in. These are all just a few things that are very important to me and make me feel I could be a great candidate for this amazing program along with all these strong independent women. I appreciate anything donated and will show my gratitude towards each and every one who donates! WISH ME LUCK IN THIS YEARS UPCOMING MISS CALIFORNIA USA 2016 PAGEANT!

                        Nick Rogers is an incredible young man! He's earned his place on the US Paralympic Team to represent the US in Rio in September. I first met Nick in 2010. He was friends with my son Tyler. Nick would show up with bruises and excuses. One night he showed up with an obvious boot print on his chest. He stayed with us from that night on. Nick has had it pretty rough through the years. Both his parents have battled with alcoholism and substance abuse issues, and for a while it looked like Nick was heading down the same path.Nick was born with deformities in his lower legs and had his lower legs amputated when he was one.  He was told he wouldn't be able to accomplish much and to expect to be on disability all his life. Well, he proved them wrong! Nick started running and hasn't let anything stop him! He's going to Rio! Nick is my son from another mum, and he calls me mom. No one in his family is able to make it to Rio to support him and I told him I would do everything in my power to get there.I went to my work to ask for the time off and they gave me it and also a generous donation. However, I still need quite a bit more. If you can't donate, please share this with everyone! Thank you in advance and I'll keep everyone updated on how he does in Rio.

                        Laguardia's Science Olympiad team needsYOUR help! We would love to make the Fame school even more famous, but we cannot do that without proper funding. The competitions consist of twenty to thirty events that cover many different science topics. Ranging from robotic arms to remote sensing, from astronomy to aiplanes, the breadth of SciOly cannot be disputed. We practice all year, putting our heart and soul into each of our events. However, we always end up not being able to do some events because of financial factors. It is extremely disheartening when our overall score drops sixty points because we could not purchase better kits to build robots, or when we do not have enough resources to build better bridges. Although school administration offers help, the school does not provide enough to cover the expenses of competing at a high level.We need your help to make our dreams come true. With multiple alumni and teachers supporting us, the 2016-2017 season should be the best one yet. Your support will help us cover expenses for:1. Tournament costs. Expenses for signing up for solely the regional tournament is $500. Because we have generated more interest, we are hoping to send two teams to the competition.In addition, we would like to do invititational tournaments, which cost more money and require transportation costs. These invitational tournaments, like ones at the Massachutes Institute of Techonology (MIT),help us prepare better for regionals, increase motivation, and are wonderful experiences for serious Science Olympiad teams.2. Supplies and tools to build things like planes, robots, pendulum clocks, wind turbines, and protein models.3. Books and study materials for test-based events. These events cover topics like astronomy, epidemiology, and forensics.Science Olympiad is a national nonprofit organization that hosts competitions around the United States (See: Science Olympiad ). It helps promote interest in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM) in students from all backgrounds. Considering our entire team (save one of our advisors) is female, and our team members come from various socioeconomic backgrounds, Science Olympiad is a way for us to see that there are huge opportunities for us. Science Olympiad is critical to fostering opportunities for women in STEM at Laguardia. All contributors will receive personalized thank-you cards drawn by team members :^) *Thank you so much for you help and support!-Laguardia Science Olympiad

I am a friend and student of Bridget Carlsen's. Bridget is a professional dog trainer with 35 years experience in AKC obedience trials and hunt tests. 5 years ago she decided to reach outside her comfort zone totry a sport called IPO that involves not only obedience, but also tracking and protection.Together she and her very firstBelgian Malinois, Moolah, havequalified to compete at the FCI World Championship in Slovakia Sept 14  18, 2016. This is an outstanding accomplishment for any team, let alone a person brand new to IPO competing with their first dog. Bridget did not anticipatebeing invited to compete in Slovenia, and she won't be able to go without a little help from her friends. She must make the decision about attending the competition by 07/01/2016. If we are not able to raise enough money,then all funds raised will be donated to ZekeCancer Fund ( http://www.goldenretrieverfoundation.org/zekecancerfund.html )Bridget is a tremendousrole model in our sport. She makes herself available (even whilecompeting herself!!)to helpherstudents as well as her competitors.Whether it's lending them equipment they forgotor answering a question, she leads by example, demonstrating exemplary sportsmanshipin the most competitive of venues.So I just have to ask, IF YOU......enjoy watching Bridget train and show her dogs...if she hasever helped you...if she has made you laugh (especially at a dog show by not taking herself too seriously!)...appreciate her taking a risk and trying something new...like that she and her dog are in the minority amongst mostlymale handlers and dogs...believe in what goes around comes aroundTHEN please help Bridget and Moolah!!They have more thanearned the right to compete, andit would be such a shame if they are not able to attend.

I am astonished by the support I have received from our community and such a wonderful response has prompted me to push further towards my dream! I am ecstatic to announce my regional title as Miss Northeast Tennessee USA 2017. I am sure you are aware that pageants are very expensive and require an extensive wardrobe. During the competition I will be judged thoroughly in 3 categories: Interview, swimsuit, and evening gown. Also, a stage introduction cocktail dress is required. I will truly appreciate any donation! Feel free to make a monetary donation, share this link, follow my instagram (NortheastTNUSA17), like my official facebook page (tba), or offer advice of sponsorship. This Go Fund Me is also taking donations for my platform The House That Mercy built, a non-profit faith based organization empowering women through all walks of life battling addiction.***********************************************************Please be sure to note:1.Northeast (solely for my pageant needs)2.

As only the first place winners get an expenses paid trip to Laughlin, Nevada to compete in the National competition during the week of September 10-17th, I have one option, and that is to obtain my own sponsorship and pay for the expense of going there to compete. I have only been performing for 5 years now, and with my recent retirement from Law Enforcement after 33 years, the doors have opened for me to pursue this path. I truly love to sing/entertain and plan on doing this until I am no longer able to do so. I have had your encouragement and support since I began this second career and am now asking for your assistance. If it is what I am meant to do then this will all work out. Either way, I Thank you all very much for your continued support & encouragement.

All the remaining money I raise will be going to two charities that are near and dear to my heart. The first is located in Boston and is called Horizons for Homeless Children. Donating to this foundation provides learning and play materials to enhance learning development for homeless children. The second is the Iranian-American Education center located in Sacramento. They provide community resources to support young Iranian and Afghan refugees who are still acclimating to American culture.The state pageant will take place in November, 2016. It would mean the world to me to not only meet, but exceed this $8,000 goal. In doing so,we will all be making an impacton two communities that would thrive from the support. If I win, I hope to use my title to start a campaign to talk to young women all over the nation about building confidence and self identity.I thank all my friends, family, and supporters in advance and I hope to make you all so proud! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.Thank you for your support!-Hamaseh

                        Stephanie JacquesVying for the title of MISS FLORIDA UNITED STATESThis April, I will be competing for the coveted title of Miss Florida United States with the ultimate goal of becoming Miss United States!I am currently working as an educator in South Florida. I am an active member of my local community, from my work to my church, I am intentional about leaving an imprint of Love and light on all that I come in contact with.In my spare time (when I have some), my hobbies include: volunteering with the American Cancer Society, Event Planning, Painting,Yoga, traveling, and of course, pageant preparation.This is my first shot at this particular title after my successes in years past in the pageant industry through my Top 15 placement and the honor of being awarded Miss Congeniality in the Miss Division in state pageants in the Miss USA system. Since then, I have spent months of hard work and dedication in preparing for this particular competition. I have pushed myself both physically and mentally to be the best person I can be and I am learning life lessons that will carry with me long after the competition is over. My pageant preparation includes: finding the perfect wardrobe including gown, swimsuit, interview attire, and rehearsal wardrobe; meeting weekly with a physical trainer and nutritionist; pageant coaches assisting with my interview skills and stage presence; as well as all of the physical beauty maintenance including hair, nails, and having the perfect smile. With all of the time and dedication it takes to obtain the Miss FLORIDA UNITED STATES crown, money can be difficult to obtain in the process. A pageant isn't all about beauty and gowns,but about learning, growing, and getting involved in your community and in my quest for the crown, I have learned to become the best version of myself. It takes a team to help make that happen and that is where I am asking for your support with a financial or in-kind services donation.*Any donations of $200 or more will be recognized as official sponsors Thank you all again for your support and donations! I am eternally grateful to you for helping me make my dreams into a reality. Game On!Stephanie Jacques :)

Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamt of being on a runway and representing what it means to be a strong, beautiful and confident woman despite life's trials and tribulations. This pageant is very important to me and part of the prize is a college scholarship; which would help immensely in my pursuit of becoming a doctor one day. I have been through a lot in my life and am hoping that this will be my big break. I have tremendous dreams and goals, winning the Miss Massachusetts beauty pageant is one of them! I'm asking my friends and family to please donate to my fund and help me with the first step of this contest. Anything helps, and anything will be greatly appreciated. I can't thank you enough for reading this. Help me fulfill my ultimate dream!

Support Shyla's dance dream,"$3,005 ","$5,500 ",Competitions," March 13, 2016",48,6,RICHMOND HILL,NY,198000,,,"

RICHMOND HILL, NY                                





                        Shyla Hernandez is a 9 year old little girl who has a huge passion for dance. She has been dancing since she was 2.5 years old. She always had a love for dance. Three and a half years ago Shyla lost her dad, (Jesus Hernandez ) whom she was very close to. After the loss of her dad, Shyla suffered a lot emotionally, just like any little kid at the age of 5 would. For almost a year Shyla lost her interest in dancing because she felt her dad wasn't there to cheer her on. She underwent counseling to help her through this tough time and as a result it helped her gain her passion back. Shyla has gotten a lot better and wants to dance around the world because she now understands that even though he isn't here physically, he's right by her side on that stage whens shes performing.Shyla loves and enjoys all styles of dance. Her most favorite is HIP HOP. She lives for it and she practices it everyday straight after school and on weekends. One of Shyla's bigest dreams now is to train in the beautiful Los Angeles California with a well known choreographer named ""WILLDABEAST"". Shyla now trains in an amazing dance school where she also competes with them. These events are highly competitive and involve an enormous amount of time and dedication for her to be able to compete at the highest levels. Shyla is doing amazing in school and has perfect attendance. Shes also involved in school activities and puts in several hours a week at dance classes and rehearsals.                 SHLYA & WILLDABEAST   Her family needs your partial support as a sponsor to help with the costs of entry fees, competitions, costumes and travel expenses for competition. Just last month in NYC, Shyla gave it her all in a master hip hop class and as a result was awarded a full scholorship, (Hundreds of Dollars in value), by her favorite choreographer WILLDABEAST for his ""WILLDABEAST"" experience out in Los Angeles, CA. This was the half of a dream come true but unfortunately this doesn't include airfare, or any other expense required to stay for the week long class. It is the families goal to make Shyla's biggest dream fully possible and the only way is with the help of you guys.   Shyla doing her first Hip Hop solo at CompetitionShyla will dance on stage with Justin Beiber on his tour in Hartfod, CT on July 10th. She was picked from thousands of submissions.    Some of her competition fees are covered but theres alot more to go. The family also need to book her flights before they continue to go up in price. Our goal is to collect this money for her in 30- 45 days. Your help and support will mean so much to Shyla. The family truly appreciates everyones continued support and wants you to know that she enjoys putting on a great show for you guys whether you make it to her events or just enjoying them on social networks. Thank You Guys from the heart and God Bless.Shyla with the worlds know Les Twins, she also had an oppurtunity to dance with these very talented guys.To view of some of Shyla's videos of her dancing, click on the link below to go on her YouTube account also if you would like to follow her success fell free to subscribe to her channel as we will be posting as she grows as a dancer.

                        I am a Baltimore City school teacher and had been for 15 years. I was illegally terminated in 2013 for personal reasons. I asked for a transfer because the school was unsafe, the students were harassing me trying to make me quit like they did their last teacher and when I did, I was terminated for bogus reasons. I have been fighting my case for the past 2+ years. Baltimore City and MD State Board of Education have been dragging my case out trying to make me give up. Now I can take them to circuit court. I have a lawyer, Robin Cockey Esq, from Salisbury, MD and we are moving forward with the case. However, I have been unsuccessful in finding a job let alone a job that could match the pay I was making. I finally found a job in April 2015, however, I am making two thirds less than my salary as a teacher. I have had to empty my 401K and my pension to make ends meet. At this time, I need help in fighting for my life back. I am trying to raise money so that I can pay this lawyer. I have seen 6 lawyers and every one of them have said 2 things: 1) you have a case and 2) this should not have even gotten this far after looking at the documents. This lawyer was the cheepest and discounted his fee because of my circumstances. However, I need help to continue to pay for this lawyer. I am fighting for my life back as well as so that we can set a precedent wherethey won't be able to do this to anyone else. FYI- THEY ARE DOING THIS TO OTHER TEACHERS. THEY DON'T FIGHT BECAUSE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM DRAGS IT OUT , PEOPLE GET TIRED AND RUN OUT OF MONEY.If you can make a donation for this cause, it would be greatly appreciated. ""IF YOU STAND FOR NOTHING YOU WILL FALL FOR ANYTHING""My GOD said I am victorious and ""NO weapon formed against me will prosper!"" I am claming this VICTORY IN THE NAME OF JESUS!! He didn't bring me this far to leave me!
