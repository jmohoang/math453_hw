Jayce and Elizabeth Thao were given to us for a brief moment to fill our lives with warmth, and then they were taken in fulfillment of God's plans. We know not why circumstances play out so perfectly to claim the lives of the innocent, but we take comfort in knowing that they have made it to their real Home, onebetterthan we or any person can provide for them. We thank God for having had Jayce and Elizabeth in our lives.Jayce Thao was born on the 29th of November in the year of 2012. Elizabeth Thao was born on the 10th of March in the year of 2014. Their inclusion into our family brought laughter, joy, and tears of varying emotions into our home. They parted this world on the 19th of September in the year 2016.With them, great grandparents finally understood that patience was probably a virtue they did not have.With them, grandparents finallycame to the realizationthat they'll never be finished with replacing things around the house that break or go missing.With them, mom and dad finallylearnedhow difficult it must have been for their own parents to schedule their entire lives around their dependent, needy, and uncooperativechildren.With them, cousins discoveredthat being on the receiving end of a swinging fist hurts, and getting smacked in the head from a toy flying across the room hurts even more.But even through all of that, with them, we learned to love when we didn't have any more patience, when something we treasured or invested in was destroyed, when we were hurt emotionally or physically. They taught us so incredibly much with the time God allowed us to have them.As such, we politely ask for anything that will grant a respectable parting ceremony in honor of their brief time here in the world, whether it be a word of prayer and/or donation for expenses, or just spending a few minutes with us at our home or the funeral.100% of thefunds raised willgo directlyto funeral expenses. Wewish todo our best for everyone inthe celebrationof their return to the Father. We thank all of you for your prayers and donations and would love to have all of you present at Jayce and Elizabeth's funeral. It means a significant amount to our family to have all of your support during this difficult moment in our lives.Once again, thank all of you for your love and support.UPDATE:Funeral Arrangements for Jayce & Elizabeth ThaoUnited Chapel Services1146 B StFresno, CA 93706Friday September 30th, 2016- Doors open at Noon- Service begins @ 7:00pmSaturday October 1st, 2016- Morning service @ 10:00am(Door opens at 8am)- Burial @ 1:30pmThe burial will be held at:Mountain View Cemetery1411 W Belmont AveFresno, CA 93728+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Support Ethan,"$36,775 ","$1,000 ",Memorials," September 16, 2016",611,8,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,2900,23,13,"                            Megan Woodward                                                                                        on behalf of Ethan KnoxINDIANAPOLIS, IN                                                        Meet Ethan Knox,(Sorry for the blurry quality, but GoFundMe requires it to be a specific size and it went weird.)Ethan is a student of mineat Southport High School in Indianapolis. He is currently a senior working toward an honors diploma and has been accepted at Purdue University in West Lafayette to major in Honors Applied Physics. He plans to be an astrophysicist--and trust me, if anyone can, it's Ethan. He loves math and science, invents ideas quickly while sitting in a classroom, enjoys weightlifting, and has a lovely personality. Life hasn't always been great for Ethan and he's made a lot of progress in terms of growing into the young adult that he is today. In middle school, things were rocky for him behaviorally, but now he is 18 years old, intelligent, and has risen above the things in life he was dealt. Despite struggles from time to time, Ethan became the young man that he is and he loved his mother very much and relied on her for support; both emotionally and financially, since his father is not around.Last week, Ethan's life was tragically turned upside down. While he was sitting in my classroom working on his online Calculus class for dual credit, he received a call to come to the office andwas met there by a police chaplain. His mother Laura, who was reported missing two days prior, had been found deceased. He is still waiting on an official report to determine her cause of death. Ethan was the next-of-kin that had to be notified of her death and is now facing his future alone, which has to be terrifying.(Ethan and his mother Laura on his 18th birthday)This vibrant, young man with high aspirations for life has suddenly been handed a lot of heavy, adult life to deal with. His younger sister is now living with her father, but Ethan stillhas to take on a mortgage payment; electricity, water, sewer, phone, cable, grocery, gas, and internet bills; and car insurance all on his own with only a part-time job at Gander Mountain to support him. To his knowledge, his mother did not have a life insurance policy, although he is still looking into it to be certain. Additionally, his mother did not fill out his 21st Century Scholars application in middle school, despite him rpeatedly taking it home, so he has to pay for his own college. (The school is working on this issue...) This is devasting news to myself and his other teachers, but more importantly to him! This young man is trying to attend college and make something of himself and now life is truly getting difficult for him. He thanks his lucky stars that his sister has her father to go to for support in this time.With all this being said, Ethan now faces the threat of needing to move during his senior year of high school, although his mortgage payment is comparable to apartment rental costs. He is very worried. He planned to move away for college, but it isn't time for that yet and he is fearful of his ability to have a place to live for the remainder of this school year. Also, having a house foreclosed on at the age of 18 could be an extreme detriment to his future. Other teachers, staff, and I are working with him to help guide him through things he doesn't already know as much as possible, but what he truly needs is some financial help from more people. We can give some, but we are a small few.After the passing of his mother, Ethan has been devasted, even if he tries not to show it. Everything he's had to deal with is causing him to get his schoolwork backed up, so he feels like he is constantly playing catch up. I fear that if he has to increase his work hours to keep his head above water financially, that his schooling might slip. Ethan is a genius (seriously...freaky smart) and I would hate for that to happen to him.If you have anything at all that you could donate to this student to help continue his future, I know he would be most appreciative. Once some collects on here, I will withdraw it and give it to him so he can start paying bills. He is needing money for groceries, utilities, mortgage payments, gas for his car, etc. and he hates to ask for it. (He did, however, grant me permission to share his story and photos since I was set on helping him.) ANYTHING, even a dollar, adds up. Please, if you have it; help. If you cannot donate, kindly share so that others might.Sincerely, Megan Woodward. Teacher. Mother. Heartbroken.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Gary was guiding on the Grand Teton  doing what he loved and in service to others. The pain and shock is devastating. Gary leaves behind an adoring wife, Kate, and two beautiful young children, Anders and Donovan. Kate Falk writes: Gary was a treasure to all those in his life. We will hold him in our hearts now and endlessly. We are each so grateful for the moments we shared with him and the gift of his beautiful spirit in our lives. He was a giver and a lover. Gary had the ability to see and bring out the best in each individual. We all loved him because he made us feel so loved and accepted. He made us feel protected and safe so that we could shine in our own way, be vulnerable and grow. At a quick glance, he may have appeared simply a carefree, joke-cracking, good-times guy, but that was a facade. Friends and family recognized that his life was guided with intention and dedication. In the eight years I knew him, Gary strived for that balance of life - that perfect concoction of family, work, friendships, and personal pursuits. Tweaking the recipe to find greater happiness, contentment and inspiration was a frequent conversation in our home. I know that it was a work in progress, but at the time of his death, life was feeling pretty complete and satisfying. He was the love of my life and the apple of my childrens eyes. Parenting our children and providing them with a world of love, learning and adventure was our number one goal. Together, we felt like we could do anything and that we had all the time in the world. Anders and Gary were already training for the day they would climb the Grand Teton together. Lastly, I loved watching Gary work - as a parent, guide and teacher. His perspective, approach and actions were so different than mine. So different, but so right. I learned so much from him. My kids are blessed by the short time they had with him. We love you Gary, forever and always. Those of us who love Gary want to help ensurethat Kate and thefamily have everything they need -- now and (especially) in the future. Please contribute to help provide for theirchildrens education as they grow up.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Two weeks ago, on September 6, Ashley gave birth to her life-long dream, a son, James Joseph. All her dreams had come true in the last year. Ashley and the love of her life, Joe, had purchased a house last October. She could not have been happier to start this journey of her life. Shortly thereafter, they found out they were expecting a little bundle of joy, a boy. Following that amazing news Ashley and Joe wed on May 21 of this year. They both were on cloud 9. The happiness and joy could be felt by all. After Baby Jimmy's birth Ashley started experiencing extreme pain. Shortly thereafter, Ashley had her first of four surgeries (5 including her c-section), over the two week span. With every surgery her health declined more and more, and she became weaker and weaker. Unfortunately, her body could no longer fight anymore. We all know Ashley was a fighter and gave her all to overcome this, she fought very hard for her life, and to be able to enjoy all her dreams that had come true, but the truth is her body could not fight anymore .  As most of you know she has left behind a new house, a new husband, and a new baby.  Any contribution would be greatly appreciated. All the money will go towardher funeral expenses, and the care of Baby Jimmy. Baby Jimmy is the MOST amazing little boy. Perfect in every way.

He and my mom, Aleta Easterling, have made a beautiful life together in our home in Mount Holly, NC. Every year, my parents havesaved up and made time for an annual family vacation. This year, we set sail for a 7-day cruise to the Bahamas on November 1. Ian loved cruising and even took this photo infront of a sign reading, ""I Wish I Could Stay Here Forever,"" in Half Moon Cay on November 3rd.On Wednesday, November 4, Ian was involved in a tragic snorkeling accident and passed away on the island of Grand Turk in Turks and Caicos.As anyone can imagine, our lives have been completely turned upside down by this heartbreaking loss, but arrangements have to be made to lay Ian to rest properly. While it has already been a crazy difficult time communicating internationaly, we are now,at this time, ready to bring him home. Ian has been taken care of by the funeral home in Grand Turk, but because this terrible accident occured outside of the United States, business is done backwards.Anyone who has had to go through taking care of arrangements for a loved one who has passedknows that a death certificate is the key to moving forward in any and all processes. However, Grand Turk will not senda death certificateuntil the funeral home is paid for taking care of and sending Ian home. Ian's family, children, and loved ones all knew of his wishes for cremation, but having to take care of this internationally has put a halt on all arrangements until payment has been recieved.At this point, we are stuck, and my mom, Aleta, is reaching out to all of Ian's family and friends.To everyone who's lives were touched by his, for everyone he's picked up lunch for, or if he fixed your air conditioning last summer. If you've ever sat and enjoyed one of his favorite beers while watching a game, or were subject to his vast array of useless knowledge and corny jokes.

Gari was an amazing son, brother, friend and Marine. He had a fun-loving personality and the most contagious laugh I had ever heard. If you were ever lucky enough to see one of his impersonations; you know the personality and laugh Im talking about. You never really know someone as well as you think, until you deploy with them. On our deployment Sharkeys optimism and endless wit kept everyones spirits up; he made the good days better, and the hard days easier. While his big personality, loyalty to our country and endless humor were great qualities; they seem like minor details when compared to the size of his heart. Anyone who knew Sharkey, knew how much he loved his friends and family; Mom, Dad, 4 younger brothers and 1 younger sister. LaGarian is now loving and supporting them from Heaven and needs us to come together and love and support them here. The burden of having to bury your child is more than anyone should have to endure and although prayers, sympathy and condolences are appreciated they cannot carry that burden. We can however, help carry the burden of costs associated with the funeral. There is no donation too small and every cent is sincerely appreciated. I would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to show your support by reading, sharing and donating.Our thoughts and prayers are with LaGarians family. May he Rest in Peace                    + Read More"

They truly are our family regardless of genetics.Our little sister Brooklynn Hampton has been sick since she was born. She has been awaiting a suitable heart donor in order to undergo the necessary heart transplant surgery needed for her to stay alive. By some miracle, that heart became available a few days ago and she went into surgery later that evening. The surgery went well, however a few hours after, problems began. Due to complications with the new heart they had to place her on a bypass machine to act in place of her heart and lungs. A few hours ago, on March 29th, we got the phone call we had been dreading but hoping would not come. Due to the overwhelming stress placed on her body, it started to shutdown and shortly after she passed away. Our little sister. Why we need your help:We are reaching out to you. We are university students studying in London and earning minimum wage - it takes months of saving for us to book our flights to LA usually - however, as you can see, we do not have months to save for flights this time. We want nothing more in this world than to be able to attend our little sisters funeral with the rest of our family. To say our final goodbyes. I am here to ask, to beg, if you could give anything. Even the smallest amount - 50p - would help us massively because right now we just simply CANNOT afford flights to get us home. As you can see, this is something incredibly important to us and is not just ""a trip to la"". Thank-you for your time in reading this and for any consideration. Yours Sincerely,Abigail Rudkin and Helena Olivia Scotland + Read More"

In a life where nothing is guaranteed, Jake made the absolute, ever-lovin' most of his time with all of us. [The photo on this post]is a family picture we took a couple weeks ago. It was taken because Jake, as always, was ready with a camera and his immense talent. All four members of our little, growing family are in it.

He made us feel protected and safe so that we could shine in our own way, be vulnerable and grow. At a quick glance, he may have appeared simply a carefree, joke-cracking, good-times guy, but that was a facade. Friends and family recognized that his life was guided with intention and dedication. In the eight years I knew him, Gary strived for that balance of life - that perfect concoction of family, work, friendships, and personal pursuits. Tweaking the recipe to find greater happiness, contentment and inspiration was a frequent conversation in our home. I know that it was a work in progress, but at the time of his death, life was feeling pretty complete and satisfying. He was the love of my life and the apple of my childrens eyes. Parenting our children and providing them with a world of love, learning and adventure was our number one goal. Together, we felt like we could do anything and that we had all the time in the world. Anders and Gary were already training for the day they would climb the Grand Teton together. Lastly, I loved watching Gary work - as a parent, guide and teacher. His perspective, approach and actions were so different than mine. So different, but so right. I learned so much from him. My kids are blessed by the short time they had with him. We love you Gary, forever and always. Those of us who love Gary want to help ensurethat Kate and thefamily have everything they need -- now and (especially) in the future. Please contribute to help provide for theirchildrens education as they grow up.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Children Lost Both Parents In Wreck,"$495,210 ","$500,000 ",Memorials," November 3, 2015","12,907",10,JACKSON,GA,75000,487,20,"                            Nathan Bradley                                                                                        on behalf of Ben FiermanJACKSON, GA                                                        Hello,I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read this. I am aState Trooper with the Georgia State Patrol. Our purpose is to work cooperatively with all levels of government to provide a safe environment for residents and visitors to our state. We are primarily focused on the enforcement of traffic laws, as well as the investigation of crashes - which brings me here.This past Halloween (October 31st 2015), I overheard an operator going over the details of a wreckwith a trooper that was a couple counties away. ""Single vehicle wreck with possible fatalies"" she regretably informed. I urgently typed the provided address into my GPS - the wreck wasn't but twenty minutes away. I started making my way down the road, letting dispatch know I would be en route.After a drive that would feel like an eternity, I could see a display of blue, red and amber lights in the distance. I exited my patrol car and felt the stillness in the air - the emergency personel weren't scurring and a crowd of witnesses were covering their mouths off to the side. I approached the horrific scene to validate what I had already suspected. We conducted our investigations and were now responsible for contacting the familes of the two occupants involved. They had matching addresses, which was less than a mile away.A county deputy, the deputy coroner and myself made our way to the house that was backed into the woods. You could hear dogs barking behind the wooden door as we knocked with desperation. The door hesitantly opened and there behind the locked screen door stood four children in full costume - a 13-year-old Freddy Krueger, 10-year-old daughter of a Dracula, 8-year-old wizard and a 6-year-old that appeared to be a firefighting ninja turtle. We were lost with words. The deputy then asked the eldest boy if anybody was home, hoping for a 'Yes' but the boy would unknowingly disappoint us. ""My parents went to the store to get more face paint. They told us not to open the door for anybody, but they should be back soon.""We would stall for the next hour while we frantically search the national databases for the closest relative. We were able to reach the kids' paternal grandmother. She had wished for my call to be a cruel Halloween Prank. I urged her to please come to the house and claim custody of the children. She informed me that she lived in south Florida, but would be on her way. During my phone conversation, I watched through my windshield as the three youngest children ran around the yard, laughing.The sun was set and their grandmother wouldn't arrive for seven hours. I'm nearly a quarter century old in age; I've never been responsible for a child's life and suddenly I was the custodian of four. I didn't know what else I could do, so I squeezed the talk button on my radio and asked radio to notify the Department of Family and Child Services.I immediately fell ill. Not only would these children discover they lost both parents, but would spend their Halloween in a county jail until somebody could tend to them; it just wasn't right. I pulled the deputy coroner to the side and told him that I was split. I wanted to preserve these kids' Halloween and the ones to come. I suggested that I'd care for them until their family was able to. Being a retired commander with the state patrol, I desired his approval, which he eagerly gave.I ran over to the kids and asked if any of them would like to go eat with me. Again, they mentioned their parents would be arriving soon. It was important to me that I would not lie to them. I acknowledge their statement and threw out that their grandmother would be meeting with us later that evening. They piled into the unit and buckled up. I activated the emergency equipment in a poor attempt to occupy their minds. The eldest son told me that he thought my campaign cover and two trooper ball caps were cool. I thanked him for his compliment and told him he could wear them, if he chooses. When I asked where they liked to eat, I was bombarded with four seperate suggestions. They all had two cravings in common; Ice cream and candy. The three youngest, who were sitting in the back couldn't control their excitment. The little girl mentioned that going out to eat was rare in their family because her mom is such a great cook. Another part of me torn. We stopped by McDonald's to grab the 10-year-old a large fry and the 6-year-old a Happy Meal, as requested. We then drove several miles to the nearest Burger King; the 8-year-old desired a Whopper with onions on it. I ordered us all milkshakes, again hopping to absorb as much time as possible.As the group enjoyed their meals, I slipped away to answer a call from my Corporal. He had called to check up on me and was made aware of the situation. I have the best supervisors in the state, so I wasn't suprised when he told me that he was bringing his wife and their son to meet us. The manager suggested that we stayed as long as we needed to, but it was time for us to get going. She gave the group some crowns to wear and said her goodbyes. The eldest son hugged her tightly and said, ""We give hugs in our family."" as the younger siblings followed the lead.I asked the children if they were wanting to find some candy. They all cheered and load back into the car. The girl asked if I was a fan of Law and Order: SVU. I couldn't help but laugh. I joked that she couldn't possibly enjoy that show at her age. She interjected that she was a fan of many police shows, but ""nobody was better than Olivia and Stabler"". She stressed that she records every episode but her DVR no longer has space. She had plans to help clear the reruns with her mother. The eldest son, who sat to my right would carry on in convesations that were beyond his age. We discussed topics such as the observable universe and his father's service with the military. He explained to me that his father served in the United States Army for eight years, completing two tours; one to Afghanistan and the other in Iraq. He told me how intelligent his father is, even sharing some of his idea for inventions to better the lives of fellow soldiers. He further explained that his father was honorably discharged after tearing his ACL.I was amazed at the maturity level of the ""Kids"". I asked how'd they get to be so smart. They gave credit to their parents, whom homeschooled each of them. The eldest stated his mother was the teacher, but his father was the principal. We both chuckled.As we made our way to the post, the boys celebrated me ""being the best cop ever"". They didn't know I was bearing terrible news, so I struggled to accept the praise. We made it to the post and I gave them a tour. I explained to them how we accept each other as family and that the post was a shared home. I further explained that being that it was our home, they shouldn't be surprised should other people drop in. That was my attempt to disspell any suspicion they may gain after my Corporal arrived.It was now about 10PM. My Corporal arrived with his family, bringing some candy, popcorn and a variety of Disney films. The three youngest sat on the couch, while the eldest read a magazine. I had to excuse myself after receiving a phone call from a number I did not recognize. It was the Sheriff of the county where the family was from. He had heard about what occured and asked if there was anything he could do to help. I told him they children wanted candy and I that we were running low. He stated he would do his best and would be in touch.As we watched Monster House, there was a knock at the door. It was three residents that heard the news and felt the need to help. In their hands were decorated goodie bags made up of candy and small toys! The kids were absolutely delighted and the visitors helped with entertainment. Shortly after they left, the Sheriff arrived carrying four holiday buckets full of candy! The kids were so excited, especially the lilttle girl that loves cop shows. She stood on the couch and explained how she never met a real sheriff before. The sheriff was touched by the children. He held conversations with each beofre pulling the 13-year-old to the side and presented him with a miniature deputies badge, made of metal. I could tell the boy admired the gift.The night continued and it would be another five hours before their grandmother arrived. We have several bedrooms on location, each with their own bathroom. We suggested they stay the night until their grndmother arrived; they agreed so we escorted them to their rooms. After their showers, they were tucked into bed. The little girl grabbed my attention when she said ""You turned an F-Minus day into an A-Plus night!"" I can't begin to explain how hard it was to hear that, considering the night would be memorable but for reasons that were yet to be disclosed to them.Grandmother arrived just before dawn. We discussed the mechanics of the crash, her role as their guardian and options availble when it comes to funeral arrangements. We both agreed that it would be best for the children to finish sleeping and to be told of their parent's fate the next day. We hoped that they would then relate the tragedy to November 1st, rather than Halloween. After the kids woke up, we walked them to the truck so that they could head home. The 13-year-old would remind us of the task ahead by saying ""Hopefully mom and dad will be home by now."" I wanted to remain in these kids lives, so I took one of my trooper ball caps and on the bill, I wrote a note telling the eldest to never change. I also wrote down my number so that he could contact me if he needed support.I told you all that to help you understand the series of unfortunate events:The children lost both parents.They children will now be moved from Georgia to Florida.Due to the move, they will be placed into public schools.And they would have to rid of their pets (they have about six dogs; two of which are pregnant) because their guardians are unable to tend to them.I was contacted by the 13-year-old this morning; I was glad he felt comfortable reaching out to me. He told me that it is going to cost his grandparents $7,000 dollars to transport his parents to Florida and the remaining funeral costs.The Georgia State Patrol as four core values: Trust, Fortitude, Professionalism and Compassion. Although, you may not be a Georgia State Trooper, I'm hoping you could help me with the compassion part. All sums donated will be given directly to the family to be used for funeral costs. Any additional donations after our initial $7,000 goal is reached, will be placed into a trust fund that issetup by the family and will be used to provide higher education to the four children involved.This is important to me because I have bonded so closely with this family. We weighed out other options and I strongly disagree with the parents being left in Georgia, while the family remains in Florida. These children must be able to visit their parents' graves during their adolescent years and well into their adult years.Considering the circumstances,the need for donations is urgent. Any donation amount will help, but if you are unable to donate I appreicate you taking the time to read and share this message.Thank you.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Jayce and Elizabeth Thao were given to us for a brief moment to fill our lives with warmth, and then they were taken in fulfillment of God's plans. We know not why circumstances play out so perfectly to claim the lives of the innocent, but we take comfort in knowing that they have made it to their real Home, onebetterthan we or any person can provide for them. We thank God for having had Jayce and Elizabeth in our lives.Jayce Thao was born on the 29th of November in the year of 2012. Elizabeth Thao was born on the 10th of March in the year of 2014. Their inclusion into our family brought laughter, joy, and tears of varying emotions into our home. They parted this world on the 19th of September in the year 2016.With them, great grandparents finally understood that patience was probably a virtue they did not have.With them, grandparents finallycame to the realizationthat they'll never be finished with replacing things around the house that break or go missing.With them, mom and dad finallylearnedhow difficult it must have been for their own parents to schedule their entire lives around their dependent, needy, and uncooperativechildren.With them, cousins discoveredthat being on the receiving end of a swinging fist hurts, and getting smacked in the head from a toy flying across the room hurts even more.But even through all of that, with them, we learned to love when we didn't have any more patience, when something we treasured or invested in was destroyed, when we were hurt emotionally or physically. They taught us so incredibly much with the time God allowed us to have them.As such, we politely ask for anything that will grant a respectable parting ceremony in honor of their brief time here in the world, whether it be a word of prayer and/or donation for expenses, or just spending a few minutes with us at our home or the funeral.100% of thefunds raised willgo directlyto funeral expenses. Wewish todo our best for everyone inthe celebrationof their return to the Father. We thank all of you for your prayers and donations and would love to have all of you present at Jayce and Elizabeth's funeral.

Haylee Fouquet, age 13, passed away unexpectedly. She was a student at West Middle School in Binghamton, NY. Haylee was small but fierce; she had a tough exterior with a heart of gold. Anyone who was lucky enough to get to know her, is now trying to process how the world could lose such an amazing young lady. As some know, funerals are expensive. There are costs unimaginable by most. Especially when it's your child, you don't expect to have to plan ahead. As a parent, you should be saving for a college fund....not such devastating things as viewings, caskets, and obituaries. Haylees mom, Claudine is one of the most selfless people I know. Always helping anyone in a bind and there to offer her last penny if she can. She has 2 other children that she is trying to take care of as well, MaKayla who is a senior this year and Dominic who just entered 5th grade. We are asking for help. There is no amount too small. The last thing Claudine and her family need right now while they are trying to make sense of all of this is to worry about the ""how are we going to afford this"". Please share this with anyone you know. Help us lay Haylee to rest. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Alma's passing was quite unexpected so her boys did not have time to prepare for this tragedy in their lives. The money will be used to keep them in their mom's apartment andkeep their utilities onhopefully long enoughfor them to get situated else where. Anytime someone asked her for help, she was there for them without waiver. I thought in lieu of flowers, perhaps donations could be made instead. I thank you all for the prayers you sent her way they meant the world to her and to me. Love and light.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, SRBCT, also known as a small-blue-round-cell tumor, Seerat's little body went through three intense cycles of chemotherapy. His 5 year old sister, Zeenet, was so sad to see her baby brother lose his hair and use a feeding tube. She wondered why they couldn't even play anymore.Seeret was eventually sent home with no hope. The cancer spread and he wasn't responding to treatment.Last night, on the night of what was supposed to be a special Eid holiday, Seerat passed away in his mother's arms. Instead of celebrating a joyous occasion, the Sahel family is burying their baby boy and arranging a janazah prayer.The family is already going through financial difficulties as new immigrants from Afghanistan to Virginia. Now they have to worry about outstanding bills, a funeral, and missed time from work.Let's give them an Eid gift and help them back up a little bit.Please spread the word. They need YOU.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I am trying to raise money for my mothers funeral. We do not know the cause of her death. But I would like to tell you a little bit about myself so here it goes. In my family there are 13 of us but now there are 12 of us. It's hard on us because we really need our mother but it's harder on my dad because he lost his true love and I know he's proud to call her his wife, also she only got to be part of her baby boy life for two weeks and that was not the only one she left she left 9 others, and she was also a big part in my grandpa's life as well. Another reason we need all the donation we can get is because my dad has been out of a job for over a year since then time has only got harder for us especially right now. With the donations that we will receive we will finally get to put my mother to rest. Thank you and we appreciate all of the donations that you will give us!!!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Raiden was always loving and seemed to have a hug for everyone he met. He was diagnosed with Autism but making daily strides and accomplishing so much, his positive and loving personality was going to bring so much for his future.Burying a child is nothing anyone wants to prepare for, especially not for a 6 year old beautiful boy. His family is going through so much already, that taking the financial burden away would help tremendously. My name is Candice Martin and I am family of Steven Fleming, his cousin from his mother's side. I grew up in Ypsilanti, minutes away from where Steven lives.All funds will be used to give this beautiful boy the proper burial he deserves. Currently it is being worked out to be able to bring Raiden back to Michigan, from Tennessee, which is very costly. All money raised will be used towards the cost of bringing him home, the funeral services and burial expenses. All funds will be released directly to Steven Fleming, Raiden's father.The family is also asking for prayers during this difficult time.

The Willie Lopez Emergency Assistance Fund qualifies as an IRS 501(c)(3) organization (Federal Identification Number 31-1564404); therefore all donations and contribution are tax-deductible accordingly.This will be the first year of the charity ball and everyone's help in making this a lasting tradition is needed.

Good times and bad. The ebb and flow of joy and sorrow that comes with this universal theme of life, is often regulated by sufficient amounts of time to rejoice or to heal in between. The universe however, has chosen to (once again) deal our family another blow, with the loss of Debra Debbie Yolanda Phillips-Newboldwife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother and friend.Debbies passing on Monday, September 19, 2016; comes just 15 months and 19 days after that of her Daughter Hilaree Nicole Newbold, and just 7 months after that of her mother Helen. With the loss of three generations, in such a short amount of time, needless to say this has been a very rough year and a half for us.As we all know the cost of giving your loved ones a dignified and peaceful journey into the next life, can be costly and stressful. There are also the financial obligations left behind from day-to-day existence that need to be sorted out as well. While Debbie lived modestly and was clear about Not making a fuss, there are still costs associated with this process of moving forward.Debbie in her wisdom did have a life insurance policy to take care of this eventuality. But unfortunately it has only been in effect less than a year. Because the policy was not allowed to fully mature before the benefit was needed, these expenses will not be covered.As a family we are now faced with picking up the emotional and financial pieces. The costs associated with the loss of three family members in such a short amount of time, has been impossible for our family to recover from financially. We are asking for donations to help with funeral expenses, to offset the few bills left behind and to possibly help us put together a suitable memorial to celebrate her life.We understand that money is tight, but anything helps. It is difficult to put a price tag on the power of helping others in times of need. The wonderful thing is that with this network of caring human beings that our family has the pleasure of knowing; even the smallest donations can make a very big difference.We appreciate the time you have taken to read our story and consider our request. We wish you all a beautiful and prosperous life, and are grateful for your thoughts and prayers.                    + Read More"

And these are just the numbers that are reported. The picture you are seeing is an attempted murder by an intimate partner who is still on the loose. I know this is graphic, but you need to understand the seriousness of this situation. Imagine being over 2,500 miles away and receiving that dreaded phone call that no parent wants to get. Your child has been in a horrible ""accident"" but I don't want to get involved. She is in a hospital somewhere in Houston. Click. After 30 tireless hours of searching you discover that she is has been admitted to a hospital as a ""Jane Doe Female"" in critical condition, on life support, with burns over 75% of her body. By the Grace of God, her Mom was able to identify her by a birthmark and a tattoo that were on a part of her body that was not burnt. The hospital informed her Mom it was imperative that she get there immediately. Mom is a hard working, minimum wage employee who supports herself. How many of us really have the funds for that type of an emergency. Immediately, a Go Fund Me page was set up and through the generosity of some family, friends, acquaintances, and even strangers, she was able to get to her daughter's side. Soon though, the funds stopped coming in and she had to return home. Prior to her return, her daughter was placed on a ECMO machine, which is one last ditch effort for survival. Doctors told her Mom it is imperative that she return in three weeks and make some very difficult decisions regarding her daughter's life. This is where you come in, I am pleading with you to please make a small donation to help make this possible. Then share this page with all of your friends until we are able to reach our goal. I also have another goal. I want this to reach as many people as possible so they can see the horrible affects of domestic violence. My niece didn't deserve this! My sister didn't deserve this! All the while this monster is running free. Domestic violence does not just affect the victim, it affects the entire family. The girl in this picture has a mother and father, she has children, siblings, nieces and nephews, cousins, and many, many friends. Please don't let this incident have been in vain.

Her mother is in a small town in Ohio and NEEDS to go to Houston, mom gave permission to operate today on her critically injured child over the phone. Yes I said CHILD.....all of you out there that have children know our babies are still our babies, when they are 3 or 30 it doesn't matter, and when your baby is hurt, you need to be by thier side. Please help Shanda's mom with expenses to fly to Houston to be with her critically injured daughter, She needs to go now! The hospital has told mom she needs to come now due to the condition her daughter is in.

A great man-a husband, father, son, brother, uncle, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend to so many-was lost in a tragic car accident. Nate had a smile as big as his heart and when you were in his presence, you couldn't help but smile too. He worked selflessly for his little family and was passionate about all things KU basketball, automotive, good Mexican food, his furbabies, his family, his work and above all, his boys. He was always willing to lend a hand to anyone that needed it, asking nothing in return. This loss is felt deeply as he leaves behind a beautiful wife, Felicia, and two adorable little boys he loved with his whole heart, Izayah & Carson, his loving parents Mona & Chris, brother and sister, Chris Jr. and Alicia, brothers in law Josh, Noah & Eli, sisters in law Shawna & Juana, 4 nieces and a nephew. Our family is shocked and heartbroken and have a long road ahead. But for Nate's honor and with him watching over us from his new spot in Heaven, we will learn to adjust to this new life without that big grin and beautiful soul. So many of you have been gracious in expressing your love through thoughts and prayers for Nate's family, and this has been so very much appreciated. The family is facing many difficulties in the coming days, months and years as they adjust to a new life without Nate. With the family's permission, we've started this fund to go towards the expenses of laying this great young man to rest and to the continued welfare and benefit of his little boys Izayah and Carson. His sons will grow up without their father physically present but will never truly be without him, and with all of the many people that knew and loved Nate, the boys will know what an amazing man their daddy truly was. If you would like to donate in his memory, it would be appreciated so very much but please don't feel obligated. Give only if you're able, and if it's from your heart. Please do continue to pray for Felicia & the boys and for the Cortez family-we know the power of prayer is being felt.

Her passion was body modification and piercing which lead her to become an entrepreneur of Rite of Passage  Body Piercing at the Tattoo Asylum where she practiced for many years. Sasha is also a 5 star body modification artist in the Tri-State area and the only licensed female artist in the Kanawha Valley.  She also loved to create unique art for her clients but enjoyed their satisfaction with the end result even more. Sasha did not have a life insurance policy therefore her mother will have to take out a personal loan to cover the impending costs associated with Sasha's final expenses.  I understand everyone has their own expenses and lives but any and all donations are greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed.  No amount is too small and will help relieve some of the financial burden from her disabled mother.  Please share and spread the word. Much love to all                     + Read More"

Shortly after birth doctors diagnosed him with Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral palsy is due to abnormal brain development, often before birth. Symptoms include exaggerated reflexes, floppy or rigid limbs, and involuntary motions. Long-term treatment includes physical and other therapies, drugs, and sometimes surgery. Due to this he cannot walk, speak, nor do anything on his own.Most families with children of his condition qualify for financial assistance, but due to the fact that he is not born in the U.S his family doesn't. The parents are of low income so they do not have enough money for his medications since his insurance company doesn't cover most of them.In February 2016 Jesus was rushed into the ICU. He was diagnosed with Aspiration Pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when food, saliva, liquids, or vomit is breathed into the lungs or airways leading to the lungs, instead of being swallowed into the esophagus and stomach. From February to July he was in and out of the ICU.At the moment he his in Hospice Care at home. Hospice care is a type of care and philosophy of care that focuses on the palliation of a chronically ill, terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs.

He had a big heart and a contagious laugh. He loved the outdoors. He put a garden in telling me that's where he connected with his father. There were days when I would sit on the back porch and hear him talking to him. The garden is his place. Ryan was cremated. I'm raising money to put a memorial bench next to the garden so our daughter, myself, family and friends have a place to visit him. I believe having a place to talk with him will help both myself and our daughter in trying to cope with his death. Anyone who wants to visit him will be more than welcome to do so undisturbed.

She had heart failure, and was at the end stage. She would collect pounds of water, so badly at times her eyes would swell with fluid and it would start leaking from her skin. She lost the ability to walk .. twice. She finally had a pacemaker put in, but one night a little over a week later overnight fluid moved up to her lungs and she couldn't breathe. She coded out 3 times, and each time CPR was done. But after the 3rd attempt to keep her alive, her body just couldn't take anymore. She fought so hard, so hard these past 8 months, and many years before. She was a heart failure patient, had 3 heart attacks along with 3 open heart surgeries, she was diabetic, and was in stage 4 of lung cancer. My grandma was and still is considered a survivor to me, even with her passing. In the midst of everything going on my grandmas credit card got hacked and while it was under investigation my grandma could not make her life insurance payment. So it lapsed. We are not a rich family, and we will be doing as much as we can ourselves to get the money saved up as well, but however much that can be donated is greatly appreciated. My grandma gave to so many people out through her life and never asked for a dime in return. Whether she was feeding someone, giving someone a place to lay their head at night, or helping someone out financially as much as she could. Please help me raise the money to honor and follow through with the last wishes of my grandma.

Job 1:21Valera and Marina Karpitsky prayed for another child for years. They were overjoyed when they found out that Marina was pregnant in January. Their baby was due for birth in September. They waited anxiously to find out whether it was a boy or girl, and their two sons, Dmitriy and Andrey, prayed for a little sister every night! You can imagine how excited they were to learn that Marina was carrying a girl! Yet the doctor also added that there were issues with the baby. At five months, the baby was diagnosed with hydrocephalus (liquid in the brain). This was a hard hit for the family, but they did not lose heart. The next months were full of prayer as the family trusted and hoped for a miracle from God to heal the baby. They knew He had a reason behind everything, and wanted this baby girl to bring glory to His name. With that in mind, every appointment was filled with hope that something had changed, yet, when it had not, Valera and Marina prepared themselves for a new life of caring for their little girl. She would likely need to have a tube that was constantly pumping out the liquid from her brain. She would also need constant care and monitoring. Her parents already loved her so much and did a lot of research on how to care for her. As the last weeks and days approached, our entire family and many friends were anxiously praying that Marina would go into labor on her own instead of her scheduled C-section on September 16, 2016. Although the doctors said it was highly, highly unlikely; Marina went into labor just two days before her scheduled delivery date! On September 14, they headed to the hospital. It was only when they got there and the doctors began monitoring the baby that they learned the news: there was no heartbeat. Joanna, or Yanachka (her name meaning God is gracious) had died and gone to heaven to be with Jesus. With tear-stricken faces, Marina was able to deliver the baby with no complications. As she held her infant daughter and prayed, her heart was filled with a love only a mother of a stillborn baby could experience. In that moment, although it hurt their hearts, it was clear to both parents that heaven is a much better place for Yanachka. She is now rejoicing and glorifying God above, healthy and full of life. Yet a part of her will always stay here on Earth with her family. Together, we thank God for His mercy, for He always knows what is best and His timing is perfect. Please take a moment and pray for this family and prayerfully consider donating any amount to help with the funeral and burial expenses, if there is any extra money donated, the money will go to the family.May God bless you!Baby Yanna will be laid to rest tomorrow, 10am at the Sunset Memory Gardens cemetery. 8901 Lawyers Rd, Mint Hill, NC 28227                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Vern Fisher, or Fish as we liked to call him, was the first to listen, the first to lend a hand, the friend you would call on, the shoulder everyone leaned on. Verns childrenEvan, Alexis, and Paigewere everything to him and he lived to fulfill their dreams.Verns kind heart and love of life was not surprising given that he was raised by a woman who was quick to laugh, slow to judge, and full of compassion. Kathy loved her children, Vern and Gale, and her five grandchildrenEvan, Alexis, Paige, Dawson, and Isaiahwith equal parts intensity and humor. Feeding our souls with her funny faces and our bodies with her homemade pizza and chocolate gravy, Grandma Kathy and her husband, Poppa Frank, enclosed us all within this loving circle.On Monday, May 16th, we suddenly and unexpectedly lost Vern and Kathy in a car accident. We are all stunned by this loss and as is the case with so many people who lose their loved ones unexpectedly, Verns wife, Vickie, and the entire family, are unprepared for the expenses involved in laying their loved ones to rest. We, the friends and extended members of the Fisher family, have set up the Vern and Kathy Fisher Funeral Fund to help ease the financial burden on the family, so that they may honor Vern and Kathy and lay them to rest in a beautiful place where they may be visited by friends and family.

She woke up and had to be rushed to the hospital. Spoke to Dr. who informed me that he needed emergency surgery and she may not make it out. She did and all was well till she went into a coma. Almost 3 weeks later she woke up. She shocked everyone including the doctors. She had a roll of 2 steps forward 2 steps back. She was getting better and then getting worse. Still she hung on with a will to live. She fought and she fought hard. She lost the battle to all the internal injury and infection on 10 september. My brother and I laid our mom to rest after being with her in the hospital almost 3 full months. I still have alot of things to get done here for her and I am asking for assistance. I have to leave and get back to Washington but hoping to get everything taken care of prior to leaving at the end of the month. I do work and can not afford to be out of work any longer taking care of my moms stuff and my own without financially hurting my household more. For this reason I am seeking assistance financially with GoFundMe. If your able please donation. Size does not matter just desire to meet this goal and continue to take care of my mom even after she passed. Thank you in advance!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

He was an actor with the West Milford Players, a vocalist, an assistant director at the New York Renaissance Faire, and worked as managers in other businesses, most recently at Applebee's in Butler, NJ. I can't even express our grief that he passed away so young. He touched so many lives and this is a pain almost beyond enduring.Mark was on public assistance and my father is broke. Our mother's funeral two years ago pretty much wiped out his savings. We are asking our friends and family to donate whatever they can to help with the funeral/burial costs. There are things like a memorial service, flowers, a concrete urn vault, and burial costs just not covered by public assistance. All of you who have donated so generously for over a week have made this a reality. We cannot even begin to thank you all.GoFundMe again suggested I raise the goal amount so that people just found out about Mark may contribute if they like or leave messages.You may also visit  http://mooreshomeforfunerals.com/tribute/details/1482/Mark-Emaus/obituary.html#tribute-startI am currently working with the Moor Family to prepare Mark's obituary.

On June 25th my 2 year old daughter Enaya died. We were air lifted to Motts Childrens hospital in Ann Arbor and spent 2 weeks on life support. I had to make the hardest decision of my life to take her off life support. She was taken off all of her support and died in my arms in 4 mins. She was the baby of the family, she was my cuddle bunny. She was so kind hearted and brought joy to anyone she met. She never cried , complained and always wanted to make people smile. My family and I are devastated. Being a single mother of 4 is hard enough financially with no help. When it came time to bury her I had no choice but to go around and borrow money. I owe so many people money right now I have not had electricity at my home for months. I still have not been able to buy her a headstone because of how much they cost and how much money I owe people from the funeral. If you can find it in your heart to donate anything I would appreciate it. THANK YOU , DANIELLE+ Read More"

The damage to her heart and brain were just too severe and her mother is making the most difficult decision of all...to let her child go home to rest in peace and comfort. Vivian's mother and siblings are asking that you don't remember her struggle, but remember her vivaciousness, her zest for life, the love she showed others, and the compassion she treated everyone with that knew her. We all have fond memories of Vivian...places we've gone to, things we've done...things that Vivain has done for us...doing our nails and hair so that we could look our best. Sharing clothing and shoes out of her own closet. Being a wonderful Auntie to the neighborhood children and making sure they were all safe and having fun. Vivian was always there to defend her family and friends and would do so without hesitation. Everyone who knew Vivian loved her...family, friends, coworkers, complete strangers could see her genuine heart and feel at ease. Please feel free to share your personal memories that you have with Vivian so that others may see how much she is truly loved, by so many. Her mothers last memory of Vivian...they were watching Jesse Duplantis together on YouTube and it was the first time that her mother realized how beautiful she was, and that Vivian wasn't her little girl anymore. No mother wants to bury their child, let alone make the most difficult decision you could imagine, in letting your child go. Along with any donations, the family is asking for your prayers during this difficult time. However, the family realizes they are not the only ones with heavy hearts. This is a pain the family does not share alone, and we know that countless others are grieving the loss of Vivian as well.The family would like everyone to know that as you pray for us, we are also praying for you. Any money donated will go towards the cost of Vivian's funeral expenses and medical bills. Any money that is left over will be donated to local charities in Vivian's memory. The family thanks you all for your support, prayers, and generosity. We will keep you all updated on any changes. Again, we thank you in advance for any of the much needed donations.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

That word takes on so many meanings throughout a life. Suzy Park was family to so many people, in so many places. She was a friend, a co-worker, a confidant, and to so many, often without anyone knowing, a saviour.We met Suzyat Rosie's Bar and Grill onJune 2nd of 2009...exactly 7 years from the day she left this world to become an angel. She started as a host, then became a server, and ultimately became a manager. Some might think it was just a routine job...not Suzy! Sure, she bedazzled everything in her path during every event...she single-handedly saved the jobs of every zip-tie manufacturer. She coached, she led, and she learned. She added her flair everywhere you might look.What many of you don't know is how hard she worked for so many charities. She poured every ounce of her heart and soul into raising money for so many causes... countless HIV agencies, animal care organizations, human rights groups, LGBT groups and homeless helporganizations. She was the backbone of fundraising efforts that raised hundreds of thousands of $$...without her, we can't imagine how many people would have been deprived of so much help and care.Suzy didn't just help organizations, she fought hard for individuals, whether they were human or feline. We doubt we will ever know exactly how many people she saved, who were at rock bottom, and saw no hope until Suzy grabbed them, hugged them, and helped them find a different path. The stories are incredible, and her impact on their lives was enormous, and continues to grow by the day.Now it's our turn to give back to Suzy, to thank her for choosing to make a difference in our lives,for making our world a better place, for giving more than she ever received and to show that new angel that her family on earth loved her unconditonally.All of your donations will be going to support her favorite Animal Rescueleague, HIV Organization and immediate family.Join our Rosie's family and her friends to share stories and remember the happy times, at Rosie's Bar and Grill on Wednesday, June 15th, 4-6pm.2449 Wilton Drive, Wilton Manors, FL 33305                    + Read More"

The Fondo Nuts (Ron, Jeff, Paul, Franko, Dan, and Oliver) came together in the Spring of 2013 to tackle the Gran Fondo New York, a 100 mile bike race in New York and New Jersey. In 2014, Ron, Jeff, Paul and Franko returned, all bettering their previous finishes (well, to be fair, Paul and Ron finally managed to finish in 2014 - bettering their 85 mile effort from the previous year. But Jeff and Franko did both better their times). We drew strength and inspiration from one another as we biked up Bear Mountain, through the hills of Havermeyer, and finally, across the finish line at Palisades State Park. On February 16, 2016, we lost ason, brother, soulmate, teammate, friend, and colleague - Jeff Bart. Now we will run and ride in his memory, starting with the Brooklyn Rock N Roll Half Marathon on October 8th, 2016. We'd love for you to become a Fondo Nut, and join us in running for Jeff (sign up for the run here -  http://www.runrocknroll.com/brooklyn/register/),but if a 13.1 mile run is not your speed, we ask that you donate to help us dedicate a bench in Central Park in Jeff's memory. Not only is Central Park the literal 'heart' of NYC, the organ that pumps oxygen and life into the city that Jeff called home for twelve years, but it was also an integral part of Jeff's identity. Jeff loved the outdoors (summer tank top time was his season to shine). He loved running, biking, and napping in the park (any park would do). He enjoyed reading the paper on a quiet bench. He just wanted to be outside, living and enjoying every moment. This bench will serve as a reminder for all of us to get outside, and for those who stumble across it in the park, to 'wake up, because there is a whole world out there waiting for them TO ENJOY.'As we run, ride and find other ways to honor Jeff's life, our numbers will grow, and Jeff's memory will live on in the stories we tell, the jokes we share and the goals we accomplish together. Jeff will continue to push us and inspire us to conquer our fears, and to exceed our expectations of ourselves. First time Fondo Nutters (nutters...really?) running in the Brooklyn RNR Half include :Linda BartAndy BartCheryl MatsonMelissa HoffmanMike PenchanskyEvelyn KenigsbergJacob KenigsbergBen KrauseRachel Mattes GreenbergDuncan GreenbergAlex GuttlerSarah GuttlerWe hope to see you on October 8th!Love,The Fondo Nuts+ Read More"

No amount would be too small. There is power in numbers. At the writing of this, Paige is trying to figure out how and what to do in the aftermath of his unexpected death.

I created this page in the hopes to be of better support to my family in our loss of my aunt and madrinha, Jacinta Brasil. Yesterday, Tuesday, 7/19/16,she was foundin bedalready passed on.Words cannot describe the devastation that we feel right now, and how the timing of this unexpectedly changed many lives. Leaving her two sons, husband, family & friends behind, we walk with heavy hearts. Without confirmation (as of yet) from coroners, it seems to have been a blood pressure or possible heart attack misfortune.During hard times as these, we are all in need of support. The funeral costs are about three times more my goals here but this is the least I can do at an attempt to help my family in the stresses of finances at a time like this. Anything that can be contributed towards the burial, service and funeral costs would be greatly appreciated; no words can say. Thank you in advance.My madrinha (godmother) was one of the most loving, compassionate and funny beings I've been blessed to have a part of my life. It is just so unreal and unbelievable.. So many great and beautiful memories will always keep her alive. She was and will always be loved by so many; she has taken the hearts of a good handful with her.

Here is their story. Johnnie Arko was born September 19th, 1994 and passed away on September 17th, 2016. Johnnie was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. This type of MD is usually only found in males and is discovered early in childhood. The disease causes the muscles to become weak and lose flexibility. Johnnie was in a wheelchair early in his adolescence, and with this diagnosis the life expectancy was not very long. However being the strong man Johnnie was, he surpassed those odds. He lived to be 21 and passed away just two days shy of his 22nd birthday. Johnnie was very much a ladies man and loved getting and giving the attention of females. Always having multiple dates for school dances. His Facebook is filled with pictures of tons of beautiful young ladies that loved to be around him. He also enjoyed playing videos games and watching MMA and wrestling. His mother Connie, is the strongest woman on this planet. She devoted her entire life to her son who was her whole world and heart. She worked very tirelessly at her job to care and provide for Johnnie. She always put Johnnie and his needs ahead of her own, even at the expense of her own health. She never once complained about taking care of her son all while working full time and being his faithful caregiver. In addition she always raised money every year for the MDA (Muscular Dystrophy Association) to help other families like her and Johnnie to help find a cure. This disease was not what defined Johnnie, but was just a part of him. He had a wicked sense of humor that could make anyone laugh. His heart was huge and full of love. He was loved by many, many people. I am asking that everyone who reads this will please help us raise money for the final expenses of Johnnie's life. He did not have insurance, and with the many other medical bills and the funeral expenses, bills are adding up. I just ask that you donate at least a dollar, or share this as many times as you can to help Connie and his family give him the proper goodbye that Johnnie deserves. + Read More"

Besides raising her kids and grandkids the best time in her life was spent as a cook in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. Three weeks ago my mother suffered a stroke which landed her in the hospital. She lost all movement on her right side and all muscles in her neck would not work. She was unable to swallow on her own which the doctors insisted she would require a surgical feeding tube be put in once her phemonia cleared up. She lost her fight September 17th. She was only 67 years old. The money raised on here will help with her funeral costs to ensure that she is laid to rest amongst family and loved ones. If possible, we would like to be able to raise the funds by February 1st. Unfortunately, my mother did not have insurance. I will be taking the financial responsiblity; however, the amount is far greater than I imagined. Not to mention, this was completely unexpected.

He swept our mother, Della, off her feet over twenty years ago. He will do anything for her and anyone. He is a welder by trade and a mechanic on the side. He worked any chance he got plus over time. He would even buy junk cars and fix them to sell for a profit. He was a great provider for our mother. Hes been known to work on vehicles because the owner couldnt afford to take their vehicle to a shop. He would fix it on his dime and not charge the owner in most cases. Unfortunately he was diagnosed with cancer. He had to stop working and was approved for disability. After numerous scans, MRIs, blood work, blood transfusions, bone marrow biopsies, and chemotherapy he is down to his last days of life. The man we once knew as a provider, strong, and independent man is now nothing more than a broken feeble body. The slow decline we have seen in him is almost unbearable. Watching him wither away to a shell is disheartening. After the company he worked for decades was bought by another corporation. Our mother contacted the new corporation after he had to stop working due to cancer. She was informed his life insurance would not transfer and his insurance would be canceled. She was in shock. After fighting cancer for months and months our parents have depleted all assets to continue his treatment. Now down to the final days of his life. We are more concerned on how we are going to burry him rather than focus on his needs and last days. So we have decided to start a GoFundMe page to help our mother with his funeral expenses and medical bills. If anything please say a prayer for our family as we soon face the inevitable. Please contribute if you feel led or please share this page. Thank you so much for reading, His family! + Read More"

His younger brother, Corey, and other friends witnessed the accident from other vehicles, and we are equally concerned about them. Jacob overcame health issues as he grew up that the doctors said he never could, but boy did he prove them wrong. Scoring high on military ASFAB testing, he could have done most anything. Brilliant young man. He had a dream of serving his country and was enlisting with the Marines. He was scheduled to leave in 54 days for boot camp when tradgedy struck. He had so many dreams and goals. He was one of the strongest, infectious, compassionate young men I know, our HERO! Due to no health or life insurance since leaving soon to serve His country, this family needs help covering medical bills, headstone, funeral balances, transportation for single mom of 4 to take children to school (happened in her car) and appointments, or a simple break to grieve. So many things, and every dollar counts. Thank you for you love and support of this beautiful young man and family. Our last family beach trip.

But however; tonight, I'm going to. My world has been shattered, my heart and life has been stolen from me.  I've been walking this nightmare since yesterday. I just want to wake up and end this nightmare now. I want you to wake me up, and have you tell me that everything is alright. I need to hear your voice comforting me. I need to wakeup NOW.  This can't be right. I've lost my best friend, my confidant, my rock, my strength, my comforter, my lover, my WIFE! My babydoll. I've got to wake up soon. I can't do this. I can't lose you.You are my world, woman, you're more to me than you could ever know. I love you more than you'll ever know. Without you, I'm nothing. You are my soulmate. I've told you for years, that behind this good man; is the best woman that this world has ever seen. That without you, I'm not even 1/4 of a man. However; with you, I'm such a man that made Superman and Chuck Norris pee themselves out of fear.You are my special, wonderful, awesome, spectacular blessing from God above. I know that I have never been good enough to give God a reason to bless me with the best woman ever; but the reason he did; is because God knows that without you, I would probably already be dead. Without you, I am a small scared boy. You Christina, are my light, the keeper of my heart, my strength to strive to be the best I can be. I miss my babydoll, she's my everything. I love her more than words could describe.God for some reason, that I will never know. Decided that he wanted you to come home. But that doesn't ease my pain. That doesn't dry my tears. That doesn't stop the hurt that I feel. I know that you are experiencing the best thing that we will ever experience; you are now in the presence of our maker, Jesus Christ. I know, that if I walk the straight and narrow road that you did, the one he wants me to; I know that I can and will be able to see and hold my babydoll again. And baby, when that day comes, you better be prepared, because I'm going hug and kiss you and hold you forever. When we meet again, be prepared; because I'm NEVER going to let you go. You'll be in my arms for eternity.I know I shouldn't be sad. I shouldn't be hurt or any of the other pains that I'm feeling. I should be happy, because you're walking and talking with our savior. I'm trying not to cry, but I can't stop. I have always, and I will always love you babydoll.Best Friend for Life Debra -Today you were supposed to come over and visit. We would have talked, laughed, and laughed some more. I can hear your giggle in the back of my head... Instead, I am mourning the loss of one of my very best friends EVER! I can't put the pain my heart feels right now into words. Years of friendship, hundreds of hours of conversations, we cried together, we laughed together, we even had disagreements, endless packages of ramen noodles, pickles, rice with soy sauce and butter (we were young, clearly health wasn't top priority).... as we carried our firstborn at the same time keeping each other company during the entire 9 months til we became mommies for the 1st time. The Lord blessed us both a few times more! I'm so thankful for all our years of friendship. The good times, the bad times and everything in between! I will miss you more than you will ever know, our constant texts, our phone conversations AND even those times when you would torture me and tickle me just cause you knew how much I hated it.... I love you and miss you so much already! We all do...Please keep her hubby and all their girls, as well as the rest of the family in prayer as they work through this very difficult time/trial. 2nd DaughterAutumn - You will be so missed, by so many. I don't know why God called you home so soon. But he does everything for a reason. You were here one day... And the next you were walking through the doors of heaven. I will tell Landyn how awesome you were, and how you adored him, and I'll show him pictures of all the fun you guys had even though he won't remember. I love you mom, and we will see each other again one day. But until then, rest peacefully. 3rd Daughter Virginia - One second they're here, the next they're gone. It happens so unexpectedly. Why can't this just been a really bad nightmare. But it's not. She's gone. She's in a better place hopefully. She will be missed severely.Step Mother Margie -Please Lord take care of my daughter Christina. Although I don't understand why you had to take her home, I want to thank you for allowing me to be in her life while she was here on earth. She touched my heart and soul in so many ways, I can't put into words. RIP Chrissy - Dad and I will always love you.We appreaciate all the help we can get.

My dear sister of only 46 years old passed away. Unfortunately being such a young woman, she hadn't prepared. Candy had a nice day, went to bed that night and then never woke up.  We don't knowwhy God chose to take her home so soon. She had so much more she wanted to do.I know that she is with our Mom now, but Candy would be so sorrowful for her son Kenny and her two sweet little grandchildren. We are all heartbroken, but if you've ever lost your Mom and especially at a young age, there is a hole in your heart that will never be filled.Please join me in raising money to provide for Candy's cremation costs and also enough to allow Kenny to have a nice celebration in her honor.Any monies remaining will be put in a college fund for those two beautiful grandbabies. What a proud grandma shewould be! It would give us nothing but joy to honor her in this way.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"
HELP-Support Benji's Funeral Costs,"$1,775 ","$3,000 ",Memorials," September 16, 2016",22,8,WESTMINSTER,CA,120000,2,5,"                            Vanessa Ann                                                                                                                   WESTMINSTER, CA                                                        I, Vanessa Gallant am the daughter of U.S. Marine Jeffrey aka Benji Gallant. My dad recently passed last week out here living close to me in California unexpectedly from a COPD/heart condition due to his life long battle with diabetes. Although we all know Jeff was highly respected and loved by so many, I am among the only family member whom is capable of taking care of what steps follows death along with the high costs that comes alongside. I am heart broken, confused, lost and grieving but worst then that I am unfortunately dead broke and am totally not prepared to give my father what he absolutely deserves, a burial service surrounded by his peers, friends and family whom all love him dearly, in our home state of MAINE. Being a US Marine you'd think the VA would cover any financial burden put on the grieving family. However being how my dad and I both were currently living on the West Coast, the VA will only cover the burial service if I am to have my dad buried in Riverside CA. Although that would be much easier, this is the last thing I will ever do for my father...and I must at least try and give this my all, so I can lay my father peacefully to rest in our home state, where he would of preferred to rest.        I politely   ask you all for any small donation you could possibly spare to help me raise enough funds to transport his body back to MAINE from California ASAP, I have less then 2.5 weeks until they'll have to burry him in California!! The high costs that follow an unplanned death are very shocking. I just CANT STAND LEAVING MY DADDY in the cemetary alone, next to no family nor friends. Pretty please help assist me in laying my father to rest with pride, honor and love. I need to release my guilt and stress and just wish to grieve. REST IN PEACE DADDY, I love you so much. THANK YOU ALL!If any amount I raise makes the difference in his burial services then I shall announce the plans and dates in which the service will be on!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"
