                        Hello, for those who know us, you dont need this introduction, but for those who dont know us, my name is Christina Thompson, and I am engaged to a wonderful man named David Barron. We are asking for your assistance in funding our wedding. I am older, but I have never been married before, so I would like to have a nice Church ceremony. We have both lived on our own for over 20 years, so we really dont need stuff as gifts. What we need is monetary assistance, so we are asking for that assistance in lieu of gifts, please.I am a brand new small business owner, so Im not bringing any salary home from my work, as it is too new to be profitable. David also has a small business, which he is having to relocate from New Hampshire to Oregon, so his clientele will be small, and he may not be making a lot of profit, either. I know of many weddings where the couple has a Money Tree or other similar dish at the ceremony, when they are requesting money in lieu of gifts. I will also do that, but we need the majority of monetary assistance before the ceremony, hence this campaign.I am trying to keep the ceremony small, I will have only a few members of the wedding party, and plan to have it at the church where I was baptized, Pendleton United Methodist Church, in Pendleton, Oregon, on September 24, 2016 at 2PM. The reception is going to be a simple cake and punch reception in the Fellowship Hall of the church, no meal, no band, no DJ, so that it keeps the cost down as much as possible. There will still be some expenses, no matter how small I try to keep the ceremony. Some of my professional friends are generously donating their services (pastor and photographer), but I do feel we should pay for their hotel rooms as they are not local to Pendleton. I need a gown and all that goes with that (hopefully that will be the most expensive single item, and I the one I am looking at, I am told, is on the lower end of the price scale), as well as flowers, the cake and punch, invitations, etc. Again, I am trying to keep expenses as low as possible, but I also know that if I have to get it all out of my pocket, I wont be able to afford any of it.We are also wanting to honeymoon in Yellowstone for a week, to have time for it to be just the two of us, without the pressures of our businesses or household worries. We will even try to keep our honeymoon as inexpensive as possible. We wont stay in the most expensive hotels, and will not eat at the most expensive restaurants.Perhaps this all sounds extravagant and even crass to some of you to be asking for assistance for this. Perhaps you think we should just go to the courthouse to keep it cheap. But, I am a first-time bride, for all I am well past the usual age for that. I have always dreamed of a nice Church wedding, and I was beginning to think I would never get married. I also want my marriage to be blessed by God, and a simple, traditional Church wedding is all I am wanting.I currently don't have a complete total of my expenses, but I do promise complete transparency so that all donors can be assured their gifts are being spent appropriately. As I get definite figures for various items, I am posting those numbers in updates. The rest of the total goal is made up of average figures from a reputable wedding planning website and from the price of items on Amazon.

Help get my wife to the USA,$570 ,$500 ,Newlyweds," July 12, 2016",10,2,HOUSTON,TX,165000,,,3,"

HOUSTON, TX                                




Hey everybody! As you may or may not be aware, my wife Sophie and I got married last month on June 11th of this year. It was a beautiful (albeit small) ceremony and we couldn't have had a better day if we tried.

But now, we're trying to move back to my country of origin (the US.) I'm still a US citizen, and although we're married in Germany, I cannot apply for work due to restrictions on my residence permit (which we're in talks to fix.) This is an issue, as it turns out filing for an immigrant visa, fees from the USCIS, and other travel expenditures are NOT cheap. Now, if you're wondering why we can't just settle down in Deutschland: it is much easier for me to work in the US, as job applicants are looked at by order of priority (highest to lowest): natural German citizen, EU citizen, foreign immigrant. This puts me at the bottom of the totem pole (despite 7 years work experience in my field!) Sophie has a mental disability (major depression and a panic disorder) that unfortunately prevents her from working.

What this GoFundMe is funding, specifically, is the immigrant fee payable to USCIS once Sophie has been approved for her immigrant visa ($165), airline luggage (two suitcases, going as cheap as possible would run approx. $100), any additional filing fees for USCIS forms outside of the I-130 (approx. $200), and train/bus fare to Frankfurt one time to get our marriage legitimized in the United States, at the US Consulate in Frankfurt (approx. $35, or 30 EUR)

We would need this campaign to meet it's goal as soon as humanly possible, as according to the USCIS.gov website, spousal immigrant visas are issued in a shorter time frame than other types of immigrant visas, and this financial hurdle is the last thing keeping us from settling down in the States. For those of you wondering what happens AFTER the ""final plane ride"", I am in talks with a former employer to resume my old position in manufacturing, and would be signing a lease shortly afterward.

I'll be frank with you guys, ANY contribution to this gets us one step closer to throwing Magic cards at each other from a closer distance than a webcam (with considerable lag), and gets my loving wife introduced to my extended family stateside. It would mean the world to the both of us to receive anything, no matter how small.

Love you all (and hope to see you soon!)



Ryan & Leonie Jensen

****For this wedding I (the groom) will be flying to Nikolaev, Ukraine. It won't be held in the United states. I can't just go to the courthouse to get married.********

Hello Donors :-)
My fiance Elena and I have been trying to get an immigration visa for 2 years. We completed everything the governments instructed us too. We paids thousands of dollars and still got denied. They say we havent been a couple long enough. I didnt know love had a time limit. We will crush this fallacy by getting married. This is why people go to the USA illegally. Anyway we decided that we are finished with the visa extortion. We are currently in the process of planning our wedding in her home country of Ukraine!
The reason I am seeking help is becuase I sunk alot of my resources into the visa. We want to get married ASAP!!!!!!! With tensions rising between Ukraine and Russia, it puts my request even more earnest. The fighting is only 120 miles away from her town. The sooner I get my soulmate here the better. 
Im working on a way to repay the top donor once I meet my goal. Right now my best ideal is to fly the top donor to the future wedding or send them a video of the ceremony if they didnt want to travel to Ukraine.(all thought it would be kind of weird to have a video of another couples wedding haha). Ill take any better suggestions if the donors have some. I just thought of good reward. My fiance is a certified fitness instructor. We could have her give you personal consulting live or on the web. Or she could develop a nutrition or work out plan for you.......
With all the frivilous reasons people have gofundme pages.....I believe love isnt one of them. Best be known that if you donate you will supporting two people that love each other very much. Thank you for taking the time of reading our small story.


Sincerely
Nicholas Boyles

                        We all know, weddings can take a big toll on a couple financially. Unfortunately we have both just lost our jobs and the wedding is closing in on us fast. As it stands right now it will be nearly impossible to afford this wedding and the the expenses to follow. Much to our hesitation, we are asking for your help. Help make this wedding and marriage blossom. Be a part of our lives forever.

                        My fiance and I met 3 years ago and due to the high cost of immigration fees, we cannot get married without your help!We met at a convention and had been in a long distance relationship ever since. After a lot of time, patience, traveling, and too many stretches without seeing each other, we finally decided that we were ready to get married and shorten the distance between us. Sounds simple right? The problem is that we live in different countries. This is what happens when a Canadian meets an American and they fall in love!You might wonder: ""Why not get married in Vegas and call it a day?"" but it's not that simple. America has huge lengthy rules on immigration. Because we live in different countries, there's a huge process we need to follow or we will never be able to live together. If you don't follow the process, you might even get denied. Imagine being married to someone and not being able to see them.I work in providing family-friendly entertainment to children online, and my fiance is the loving mother of 3 beautiful children who I happily and proudly help support. We make enough money between the two of us to pay our bills, and feed the kids, and it leaves nothing left for the two of us. We currently are trying to support our family and our TWO households, which is becoming a huge strain on us financially and emotionally. This distance is not only hard on us, but also difficult for the kids. With this process finished, one of us would be able to sell one household and move to America, which is our dream.This isn't about the wedding. We know that weddings can be ultra expensive or ultra cheap but we can't even make it to that part without your support. In order to get there, we need to file for fiance visas, family visas, record checks, medical exams, and the work visas. They all cost so much more money than we have available right now.We would do anything to have the opportunity to get married and live together.Thank you all so much for your help!

We have lived together for some time now, so we decided traditional wedding gifts such as appliances, dishes, silverware, etc., might not be the best idea. In lieu of gifts like these, we're asking our family and friends to donate money in order for us to have our dream honeymoon! We hope we're able to go to Puerto Rico or Jamaica, and either would be amazing.Thank you all so much for thinking of us on this momentus occasion and for anything you are able to provide! We love you all!

                        Hello everyone, my name is Sanelly Quintero , I like positive vibes and love animals, I currently live with my fianc and we have many dreams and goals to accomplish, we like to help the world by doing our part one step at a time,we love animals and so when we see an animal in need on the streets we dont think twice on lending a hand, we know how wonderful it feels to help. We're reaching out to you knowing that together we can help each other, which is the reason we created this fundraising initiative.We want to raise funds to help 7 members of my family in Colombia to attend our wedding. YEAH!!...We are getting married and the wedding will be in Brazil on September 22ndof 2016,and we have until June 15 of 2016 to buy the flight tickets.My fiance Willian is Brazilian and I am Colombian, we decided to get married in Brazil since most of his family (70 members) are not able to buy flight tickets. Furthermore his 94 year old Grandfather who will represent willian's deceased parents is unable to travel due to his age. Most of my family and friends manage to save enought money to buy flight tickets for our wedding  except for 7. It would mean the world to me if they join us on this special event. These group of 7 consist of my brother, my only niece, my uncle and 4 cousins whom I grew up with and I care about them dearly , these people are very important to me. I haven't seen some of them for almost (8) years.With the funds collected we are going to buy the airline tickets from Colombia to Brazil for them. Unfortunately due to the current economy crisis going on in Colombia that kind of money for them exists only in dreams. The price of the tickets is worth what you spend in 3 months for food!!Please help us Fulfill this dream of reuniting our families, give them the opportunity to explore a new culture and get on a plane for the first time. Everyone knows how much a wedding can cost. although we tried saving as much as we could, we are not able to pay for their tickets. Friends... my fiance, my parents and I will be forever grateful if you could help us accomplish this journey of a great wedding bringing 2 families together.From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU all for all the support and thank you dear universe for making this possible.BLESS YOU ALL   :)kindly,Sanelly Quintero.

Help us get on the same Hemisphere!,$745 ,"$3,000 ",Newlyweds," October 1, 2012",21,48,BOSTON,MA,178000,,4,7,"

BOSTON, MA                                




Originally two crazy kids making videos and making art found eachother on YouTube 8 years ago. HI! We're Jesse and Kane. We both had dreadlocks, and had an immediate bond finding one another, hilarious right? But how crazy is it, that a jeweler from Scotland, and a sfx makeup artist from America have been together for 3+1/2 and engaged for 2+ already?

Kane and I were friends for years on YT, and big fans of one another. I remember I was his 3rd subscriber... EVER! We both are artists, but through the years knowing one another, we fluctuated... I had a BF, he a GF... but more or less we became what you'd call virtual penpals... and now we're happily engaged, but still living 3,099 miles away from eachother.

We sent art to one another, and the recordings of it all and dedicating/showing our work off, we would post! Still to this day we have them posted to our channels. (I really hope YT never goes away cuz I want my grandkids to see this stuff!)  www.youtube.com/elkano,  www.youtube.com/jhermbaby - 

5 years flew by and in 2010 Kane lost his dad to cancer. I noticed he wasn't posting and I asked him to come back. He did :) and painted a portrait of and for me, completely tongue tied and nervous talking to ""me"" filming himself. Truly something to see. A grown man tongue tied and in love with the girl he painted it for. It was the best gift I'd received in a while, and we still can share those moments because of the internet, and YouTube... our fans that have helped make it possible bc you support us and our story.................. aaaaand let's not forget ... our dreadlocks.

Our memories, our love story.... our current living situation.. is virtual. :/ All documented through our video stories. Many of you have supported us for years now. You know the story, for those of you who are reading now... we have an ACTUAL timeline that one's welcome to watch again and again, you may have, or maybe you haven't, but if so you'd see a beautifully tragic love story/movie unfold. And the kind that you always wish to see end with two people who care so much about one another, finally getting their wish. 

I just wish I had enough to be in the same hemisphere as the man I love. - Thanks for reading, and any help by donating, is so kind and we thank you in advance. All donated is money well spent as Kane and I are a couple for a lifetime. An investment in a neverending love story is what you'll be doing. Be it $5, $10 or go cray with $50!!! NO MATTER what.. it's showing us you believe in us and are investing in us as a couple. I want to thank all who have donated. Share with your friends and make our story be known. 

When it's true love, everyone knows it because it brings you to life. He makes me want to be a better person!

If you don't know it.. watch how Kane proposed after 8 months of dating on our 8 month anniversary, 5 months of which we spent online. No physical. Eliminating the physical made it more taunting to hear and see and imagine and explore using sight and sound only.

This was and is still a relationship relying on modern technology to provide us with the visual and audio, but mainly with honesty, trust and the most important: communication. That's the secret... don't keep anything from the person making up the other half of your heart. It'll all come out anyways if you both really do share one. Some valve acting like a jerk will leak it into your partners, causing a coronary that won't end well. If it does, it takes time to reestablish a trustworthy connection... or some good surgeryWow, that was not wrapping it up.. I get carried away. If you read the whole thing, I applaud you for falling down that rabbit hole. Here it goes... I wish that we make this goal, and soon!

Thanks guys! - JHERMBABY (Jesse) & ELKANO (Kane)

Help Us Get Married and Move,,,Newlyweds," August 7, 2016",1,,Gescher,NW,,,,,"

                        Daniel and I met a little over two years ago through a friend online, and have been together as much as possible ever since. Yet it wasn't always possible to be together. Daniel comes from northern Germany, and I am from the Pacific Northwest in America. For the first year of our relationship, we skyped everyday and managed to meet in real life once or twice. As anyone who has ever been in love can imagine, at a certain point, an hour-long video chat each day just wasn't enough anymore. We moved in together a year ago (or, rather, i moved in with him). We also got engaged around the same time.Over the last year, we've been discussing moving back to the Pacific Northwest together, this time permanently. We both feel very at home there. Not only that, but we would love to get married there. The ocean is beautiful, and we could more easily afford to get Daniel's parents over to Washington than to bring my entire family over here for a wedding. We originally planned to save money for this for a while longer, but that seems to no longer be an option.Our work place has not been a friendly one for quite a while. Not only do we only make 450 (roughly $500) each per month, our bosses are far more than mean in any usual sense (we work in the same office). For instance, they have told Daniel multiple times to quickly carry very heavy objects up the stairs in order to induce an asthma attack, and then laugh at him for hyperventilating, for sweating while doing so, telling him he only has asthma because he ""is lazy,"" despite the fact, according to performance reports, he does more work than anyone else in the office. Not only is this a major health risk, carrying heavy objects has nothing to do with his job. He works as an IT customer support agent. The bosses have also told me they will fire me if I speak English at all, even at home or over skype with my parents. They also call all of the workers ""dumb"" nearly daily. If anyone takes time off for being sick, they are accused of ""faking it,"" and angrily lectured for half an hour loudly, regardless of whether or not they have a doctor's note and explain the medical issue to the bosses.As a result of these issues and more, including the company generally selling unreliable services and the bosses fighting amongst themselves, the business is going under. Since we will be jobless in a matter of time anyway due to this, we would like to take this opportunity to move to America in the next few months (November to be exact). We would get married short after, hopefully, as we've been planning. Unfortunately, we haven't managed to save up all the money we would need. We still need 1,600 to get Daniel's parents two-way tickets (we would love to have them attend, and they shouldn't miss their child getting married), and 400 for vet appointments so our cats can be approved to fly and another 500 for boarding passes for them. Since Gofundme takes a portion of money earned, I've accounted for their share in the amount above.As many people have, we have seen the wonderful things people can do with the internet in terms of pulling together and helping each other out. If you could help us and our cats fulfill our dream of starting our lives over in Washington, and of having a lovely little wedding, we could honestly not be more grateful. If you could also take the time to share this on your social media sites, it could make a world of difference. Any help is appreciating. Thank you very much, from our little family to yours!

                        My name is Taylorand my partner Casey and I are looking for any bit of help with the very expensive and difficult Defacto visa process.Our story:We first met in Bali in July 2014 and have been insperable ever since. We lived together in Australia for about 7 months before Casey decided to come back to Canada with me for a holiday. While in Canada we decided we wanted to continue out life together in Australia and apply for a defacto partner visa. Ten months and $7000 later the visa was refused. Although we have been together for well over the one year requirement our case officer did not believe we had sufficient information which was hard for us to collect as we are both young and don't yet share any major financial commitments. This news was absolutely heart breaking to us. All we want is to be able to live together in Australia and build our future as a couple.I am now living in Australia with Casey on a tourist visa. Being on a tourist visa I am not able to work and must leave the country every three months to renew the visa. Being unemployed and having these requent flights out of the country has left us with quite a financial strain.After meeting with a migrant agent he recommended our best option would be to re-apply for a defacto visa but this time lodge it from onshore. This will cost us nearly $10,700 after the agents fees and the cost of the visa itself. After already paying $7000 the first time around we are usure how we will be able to go through with the application. I am hoping that I can possibly raise a few bucks on this gofundme website to help in our cause. I know it's a lot to ask but I'm hoping that a few people willhave sympothy for us and helpme be with the man that I love.

                        Hello my name is Ash, I'm 25 years old, my fiance is 31 and we have a daughter who just turned 5. We have been together for 7 years and have been engaged for 4 years. I'm writing this because I would really love and appreciate your help for my partner and I to get married. We wish we could have done everything in order by first getting married, finding a home and then having our daughter, but our cards were dealt a bit differently.  I've always felt stronglythat everything happens for a reason. Even though our daughter came as a bit of a surprise when we were younger, she cameas a gift to me on my birthday. It was the first birthday I would spendwithout my dad, as he had passed just before I had found out about her. She has been the greatest thing in our lives, and I have always been grateful and appreciative that I was given our little family in replace for the oneI lost. We have lived off mypartner's incomewhile I've been completing my degree and taking care of our daughter. We also run asmall business on weekends by cutting lawns for commersial properties. Though, after paying all the house bills and livingexpenses, we are never left with much to gotowards our wedding. We really want to bemarried, especially before we give our daughter another sister or brother (that she's been begging us for). We have considered signing papers as we know we wont be able to afford a nice weddingfor a very long time, and would probably have been together for more than a decade by then.  My partneris hesitant tosign papers because he doesn't want us to regret not having aproper wedding. I don't mind as long as I can end up calling him my husband.  My only hesitation isthat our daughter has seen too many shows with people getting married, andfantasizes about us doing the same.(Often asking me on a daily basis, when are we getting married, as well as asking if we can have matching white dresses on the day). I would really be grateful just to have something simple. To have a nice day with some family, to beable to give our daughter the chance of being a flower girl, and havesome beautiful pictures taken to remember the day by. We wouldn't even need a honeymoon, this would be more than enough for us.  This is what the money would be used for, and it would mean so worldto us. The sooner we could achieve this amount, the sooner we would be able to have ourceremony. Words could not describe how thankful we would be for this, but in return we could send you pictures of the day for what you helped us accomplish (maybe by including your email address or a way of contact). Thank you for making the time to read this! WarmRegards, Ash

                        The time has come to make honest women of ourselves... WE'RE GETTING MARRIED! And in Las Vegas, ""Sin City"", no less! From the start, we knew that not everyone would be able to make it. A ""destination wedding"" is incredibly expensive but don't worry, we have that covered. If you're reading this, you have visited our site and know that you can watch us pledge our eternal love for each other in the comfort of your own home. (You're welcome)BUT, that doesn't mean you aren't allowed to show us love in other ways! This GoFundMe account has been created for those who wish to help us celebrate our wedding, yet aren't able to physically be there. In lieu of a traditional wedding registry, here you can help to make sure that our wedding is as FABULOUS as possible! How? Well let me tell you!Everything's has been booked: hotel, flights, venue, reception, etc. However, this doesn't mean those important details can't be improved. With your generous aid, we can:Upgrade our room, upgrade our flight, tip the photographer, driver and officiant, purchase wedding pictures, rent a car, buy show tickets, BUY US DRINKS, meals, baggage fees, souvenirs, or even tip the go-go boys the list goes on! Now, why aren't we doing the traditional wedding registry at various home good/improvement stores? Simple, we have everything we need! What we want is to create the memories of a lifetime with the loved ones that will be around us as we begin the biggest adventure of our lives and one day have the ability to look back 50 years from now without a single regret (maybe...). Please do not feel any obligation to donate liberally, or at all for that matter; we are already guaranteed to have a blast. But if you are so humbly inclined, every penny would simply add two more simmers to the glitter of our party. Thank you so very much in advance and we can't wait to see you again as Mr & Mr Diaz-Muniz!!

We had to move recently resulting in our savings for this dream and our wedding being almost entirely diminished. We'll be getting Married in July and our trip is planned for November. Instead of wedding gifts or shower gifts any contributions; large or even a couple bucks, to making our dream come true would be a huge help and greatly appreciated. VIbes are valuable too, so even if you can't show us some love at this time spreading the love to anyone you know who loves us would also be an act of love we love for which we love you very much!Thanks for the love!Melina and Erik

Media enquiries via the charity ONLY please see below.Emma and Jamies WeddingCan you find it in your heart to help?We would like to introduce you to a very special couple. Emma and Jamie were excitedly planning their dream wedding in Lake Garda, Italy, when tragedy struck in August of this year.Emma tells the couples story:Jamie and I met 8 years ago, after my former partner and I bought a house next door to his mum and step dads. Following the breakdown of that relationship I was introduced to Jamie, although I cant say it was love at first sight; to begin with, I was too shy to say, hello, and wasnt ready for anybody else to enter my life. He never gave up though. I kept in touch with his mum and step dad once Id moved, and was soon persuaded to give him my number. We didnt move too quickly; my daughter was born with hip dysplasia and needed a lot of my time, and I was working part time. Soon, though, I realised that he wasnt going to give up, and we went on our first date  wow. Our first date was a trip to London to see The Lion King, and a ride on the London Eye  it isnt hard to see why I started to let my guard down. I was falling for him, fast. Our relationship was romantic from the very beginning. Jamie worked away, but would keep in touch with verses of the song, Amazed by Lonestar, and hed bring coloured roses for me when he came home at the weekends. Id fallen in love, and it was obvious that Jamie felt the same way  he had grown incredibly close to my daughter, Amara, and never missed a hospital appointment or operation. He learned how to do everything for her and I began to trust again; my daughter even calls Jamie Dad, though she still sees her birth father. Eventually, though, Jamie and I decided to start trying for our own baby, and were blessed with a daughter in July 2010. In 2012 we bought our first property together, and life couldnt have been better.Copyright Emma & JamieJamie proposed in Venice, during a trip for my 30th birthday. It couldnt have been any more special or romantic; a penthouse suite, a homemade book of our relationship, and a proposal on the Rialto Bridge with a charm bracelet. We decided at once to marry in 2017, in Lake Garda, Italy  we were having the time of our lives.In August of this year Jamie was diagnosed with cancer. Once we got over the initial shock we tried to stay as positive as we could, but things were drastically changing around us. At first we were told it could be lymphoma, and that Jamie had a good chance of survival. This became testicular cancer, and again his chances seemed good. The specialists couldnt be sure, though, so we were sent to The Royal Marsden hospital in London; Jamies cancer is very rare, and has no diagnosable origin. Called small cell carcinoma Jamies cancer is incredibly aggressive, and there is no cure. No cure. The words ripped our hearts out. While Jamie has been offered treatment, and is currently undergoing chemotherapy, we have no idea how long we have left together; hopefully the treatment will reduce the size of his tumour and give him as normal a life as possible, but weve been told it will continue to grow and come back  there is no getting rid of it.Copyright Emma & JamieDespite all of this Jamie has been my superman, accepting every challenge and treatment, and fighting every step of the way. The cancer is now in his lungs and the treatment makes him very ill, yet I seldom hear him complain. Even when Jamies tumour reacted to the treatment and tangled itself in his bowel, causing an enormous amount of pain and complications, Jamie stayed strong, and remained as independent as he could. He has faced pneumonia, lapses in consciousness, a huge blood clot caused by being bed-bound, long waits, and treatment, all with a relative smile on his face  he is my hero. Jamie takes a lot of medication each day, including three injections, but has improved no end  his mobility gets a little better each day and, each time he has chemo, the ill-effects seem to get less and less. However, we know that there is no permanent solution to his cancer, and simply want to make the most of every moment. We stay as positive as we can, and fight it with our every breath; there is no other way.Emma and Jamie are no longer able to plan their dream wedding in Lake Garda, but would love to cement their relationship and marry in front of their friends and family while Jamies condition is stable. This is where you come in; it doesnt matter how much youre able to give, as every penny is a step closer to this special couples happily ever after. This beautiful family deserves the happy memories that a wedding would bring, as well as the love and smiles that will, no doubt, carry them through the darker days.Please find it in your hearts to donate.Thank you.Naomi and The Wedding Wishing Well FoundationMedia enquiries to info@weddingwishingwell.org.uk ONLY please.

LONG BEACH, CA                                





                        Hi there! We are Marcus Jacobson and Michelle Mangel, and we want to get married and obtain a larger and, frankly, less moldy and cockroach-yliving space.We are trying to make these life changes with an income which is insufficient for making these changes a reality.Both of us are disabled and on disability for now. Michelle is looking to get her Ph.D in Social Service Administration (she has already completed a Master's). Both of us have been told throughoiut our lives that we are special individuals, that we should not give up, And we are not giving up...We have both been actively engaged in our mental health treatment for a surprising amount of time now, and, seeing thr benefits, this shall continue indefinitely.We've known we wanted to be together forever for awhile and we feel that actually getting legally married will be just one more affirmation of our commitment to one another. It is very important to us that the government recognize this. :-/Of course the marriage is significant, but even more important is our goal of uprgrading our life and we feel that that starts with a different living space. Within months of moving into our current cockroach-affected studio, the ceiling in the kitchen (well about a quarter of it) fell onto us, spilling debris and mold everywhere - into drawers and appliances even.See pictured one of several portals into the guts of our tiny studio. A dark, moist place (not the fun kind) filled with fungal growth (not the fun kind).We like to think of the black mold as our third roomie, and we're quite sure the spores we are undoubtedly inhaling have some nutritional value when they are caught in our throats and transported to our stomachs (we know we like mushrooms).We make do with what we have, but we intend to take our life together in a different direction. We know there are bigger, nicer apartments (sans floating death particles and cockroaches) available in our area for around what we pay now, however coming up with money to cover a deposit is impossible on our current income. Additionally should we choose to grow our little family, we will need more space for sure (for a child, or rats, or just a room that is not also where our bed is).Together we are doing better than ever in life and we want to continue improving (We've been hearing things like ""you'll be dead in a year"" for so long it's shocking to hear things like ""Where's my grandkids?"").Both of us have avoided hospitalization longer than ever, we have kept a home together, and most importantly we have each found the person we wanna spend our life (lives? (we cannot agree on this - if you have any grammatical insight please comment)) with. We have been there for each other through many and varied misfortunes and difficulties (y'know, tri's n trib's?). We have endured losing housing, homeless shelters and hospitals. We have remained together through personal and relationship issues we would otherwise have avoided, and we have not let anything pull us apart. And we won't. We feel we should mention that our connection is not altogether new - it began back in the year 2000 when the two of us were not even old enough to (legally) buy booze.Cute, eh?Although we were crazy about one another, our mutual lack of experience led to miscommunication and misunderstanding regarding one another's real feelings about each other. The progression of our relationship was derailed by extraneous concerns and inexperience.Fifteen years later we met up again in spite of potential misgivings (Michelle never got over the fact that Marcus stopped calling in 2000; Marcus worried that she was now hanging out with him as part of a revenge plot for ending the 2000 relationship by not calling...).Moving on...GoFundMe.com tells us we should write about how we intend to spend any money we are fortunate enough to receive...1. One three gallon bowl of golden popcorn - can't eat it but it looks great strung up on a christmas tree (nothing shines like real gold, and nothing strings up like popcorn).Nope, wrong list... but we'll stick with the format.1. The wedding itself. Nothing fancy, just a simple ceremony at the courthouse or at Michelle's family's church: Lighthouse Coastal Community Church in Costa Mesa, CA. (we forgot to let them know, but they will. Hopefully before we show up. Definitely not gonna just surprise Pastor Leigh).2. Clothes. For the wedding and subsequent party we're hoping gets thrown for us by Michelle's parents (ALL are invited, BYOB), we need proper attire for the occasion - a dress for Michelle and something classy (suit?) for Marcus. Again nothing too fancy (we're saying it doesn't have to be expensive, just purty. we both clean up real nice n cheap) it's just that our incomes don't really allow us to purchase nice clothing.3. RIngs. We need rings to symbolize our union in atraditional way that is really very not ""us"". We want relatively simple rings to ward off unwanted advances (that's all of them, folks) and to... and to... (it just makes Michelle happy to see rings on ourfingers. sorry)... we'll just post some examples -Michelle's the only one with a ring now, but it isn't exactly the right size (first picture), and the other two are example pictures of what kind of rings we're looking at (Marcus then Michelle). Both rings are very inexpensive - first ring was a campground find that Michelle forcibly removed from Marcus and immediately appropriated (Marcus is not being forced into this union. Really.):4. Security deposit and help with first months' rent for a nicer place to live. We're just looking to get a 1 bedroom place so we can have some space that is not the bedroom and kitchen. Somewhere for expansion of family, hobbies, etc.(crib, amps, indoor garden, one of those weird leather swings (are they leather?)? who knows?) This will be far and away the destination for the bulk of any funds generated.We are goingto get married within the next three months, and we intend to find a new place during that time.If anyone responds to this or donates we will be unable to adequately express our gratitude because it will be too big (but we'll try). In lieu of adequate expression we offer the following: A. We will write and record a personalized song together for each donor - they're guaranteed to be silly, but catchy in a way that sticks with you (perhaps too well? Nah.). B. We will pray for everyoneto receive god'sgrace as we have received it and continue to receive it (even if it's just winning another scratcher from your scratcher).C. We will strive to rememeber toalways be grateful (even for the littlest things like pooping without help). D. We will give back when and where we can.

                        Hello family,this is Moses from SpiriTruth Worshipand this Sunday, on July 17th, 2016I am getting married to the girl of my dreams, the one God set apart and sent for me. AProverbs 31 type of woman. Truly a woman after God's own heart. Here's a little bit of our love story:For a long time, for like, the longest time... my deepest heart's desire has been to be married... for God to give me a wife. I had to wait for a while, actually for a long time. I made mistakes in the past and I feel God wanted to really really mold me into His image and make me more and more like Him before sending me 'the one' He had set aside for me. So I remained obedient to God. I had to get to that place where I was totally happy with just 'HIM' and only Him... I had to let it all go, all my wishes and desires, what I thought I wanted and needed in a woman. This was not easy to do... I had to get to that place where His love was more than enough and where His heart and His Ways was all my heart desired; to please Him. Then and only then, when He knew that I was ready... after waiting and waiting on Him, He sent me His precious daughter: Taina... He sent her in the most unique way!She found me by one of my piano worship videos... It was Psalm 91 .God used that song to touch her in such a way, that still to this day, it is one of her favorite songs :) This is truly a blessing from my heavenly Father.... On our ""She said yes!! wedding proposal video you will see and experience 'Our Love Story' in details. We really tried to share everything in the least amount of words possible so the video wouln't be super long.""Moses & Taina... united in Him and by Him""We have only seen eachother in person twice.Taina and I first met in person back in September 17th 2015 when I visited her in Puerto Rico. Several months later she then visited me here in California on New Years Eve, December 31st, 2015. I then proposed to her the following day; New Years Day 1/1/2016It is so amazing that the third time we meet will be to get married and will start a family and then together we will be able to say: ""as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. -Joshua 24:15And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. -Genesis 2:18 Taina & I have done everything by faith. I mean, everything in our relationship has been led & inpired by Him. I live in California, Taina lives in Puerto Rico. A long distance relationship but so united in and by His Spirit.Initially, my plan was to go to Puerto Rico and get married over there so her whole family, friends, cousins, aunts and uncles and even her 3 dogs would be able to see her get married and experience her special moment.Unfortunately, things did not go as planed. Everything was not flowing and things were just not happening. Nothing was moving and on top of it all, we were very, very stressed out about it all. This is when Taina expressed to me that she just wanted to get married to me. I was the one who wanted to give her this 'special wedding' and have everyone attend. BUT, His thoughts are not our thoughts and His ways are not our ways.Taina and Iprayed about the wedding situation and immediately felt led to get married here in California.WOW!!! it was like fresh water in the desert. We knew it was the right decision because of the overwhelming peace we felt after coming to that conclusion. Next thing was to speak to Taina's parents. This would be the moment of truth! But!!!... to our surprise and biggest confirmation from God... Taina's parents were 100% supportive of our decision! It was like a miracle! (more fresh water in the desert) Specially when Taina's father has NEVER left the island (Puerto Rico) and has never gotten on a plane in his life. Let's just say that he doesn't like the idea of been in the air, the thought alone it's a huge challange for him. But we are so thankful that both; her mom and dad are coming to join us for our Godly marriage union.The reason for this Gofundme campaign is because, there are still some needs that we have for our upcoming marriage in July, 2016. Basic things that every newly married couple needs for their new place including a new lease for an apartment and a down payment for a vehicle for Taina which we will need as soon as possible. (no honeymoon)If you feel led to bless us just know that it will mean so so much to us! We want to thank you in advance.Thank you so much for taking the time to read the super short version of our love story.May He continue to draw you closer to His heart more and more and bless you in everything you do.In Him,Moses Hilario(soon to be married yaii!! *** Date:July, 18th 2016)*** Watch my Marriage Proposal Video below ***

Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers,But a prudent wife is from the Lord. -Proverbs 19:14He who finds a wife finds a good thing,And obtains favor from the Lord. -Proverbs 18:22Psalm 91 - The song that united us <3

Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. -Proverbs 31:106But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.7For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,8and the two shall become one flesh; so then they are no longer two, but one flesh. 9Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.-Mark 10:6-9

The resort is already booked and paid. Passports paid. She went to get her nest egg that they have saved of $1600 to find it gone, from her home. Nothing else touched or taken. The most heartbreaking about it is it must've been someone they know and trust. My daughter said to me ""Mom, the only thing I can do is think that whoever took it needed it more than us"". Well, its still sucks and honestly, impossible for them to save up that amount they had worked so hard to stash for this incredible week.They both work hard. Full time jobs, and have planned this for a year. I had an outpour of those who have asked to help. This is your opperturnity, and PLEASE no one under any obligation whatsoever.Please please know, that although this is a HORRIBLE and sad story, I understand there is much worse out there. Those that need much more than even money. But, that being said, I'm giving my loving friends the opporturnity here to donate to their honeymoon (they have already streatched it out until November). If you can, if you want, thank you from the bottom of my heart. If not, please know, that is totally fine.Love you all so much. I believe in good. Tami

                        We decided to go with GoFundMe rather than Honeyfund, so people can give what they wish and trust the source better. Brianna and Christina are blessed. If you wish to give a gift in celebration of our wedding, we ask that you add to our honeymoon fund to be used in the Spring. All money will be used for that purpose only. We are not entirely sure where we are going yet due to lack of honeymoon funds, but we are hoping for a quiet beach area. Maybe Myrtle Beach or Florida. If you wish you give a gift instead, we are registered on Amazon but would love for you to give here. Disclaimer: This is not a charity. All funds will go towards sending The Rockos on their honeymoon! Thank you for anything you wish to give. Any little amount will help.

It's very exciting.We have gotten so much planning done and there is still so much to do.I'm absolutely excited about this. I couldn't be happier or more sure about anything that I've ever been about to do.It means the world to me that I can take this step with the woman that I love.But as of late we have hit a wall financially while planning the wedding, and life is really throwing us some curveballs. My fiance is having a some medical issues and due to this she was out of work for awhile. Out of the kindness of her heart, my mother helped us with some money we needed, and then shortly after my mother started having serious health issues of her own leading to finance problems of her own.As you can imagine this has not made anything easy at all, but we're doing everything we can to get things together for the wedding.The money we receive will be used to pay for the last of the traditional wedding purchases.-My suit-The grooms cake-The Photographer-Invitations-CateringWe would need the funds very soon due to the date quickly approaching.It would mean so much if we got the funds we needed.We would be able to ensure that we can take that big step towards our new life together.Anything helps and everything is so appreciated.

What's our story? Let's keep it short & sweet: We're Samia & David. We met on the Internet(on Couchsurfing.com, it's not even a dating site!"") in July 2014. Within seconds of our first Skype video call,we knew we were made for each other. Abitclich, but it's the truth. (David: ""So I quit my job, packed my bags, and moved to Mxico."")Two months later, and after a lotof brainstorming & hard work, we opened up a restaurant together: Verde Vegan, the only Vegan restaurant in Acapulco. And on April 30th 2015, we gotmarried!(Wedding day photo above. Pretty awesome, right?) NOW: Due to popular demand, it's timeto extend the celebration to our stateside friends/family that weren't able to join us in April. On Sunday October 18th, 2015 we will hostour American Wedding in David's hometown of New Haven, CT, and in classic New Haven style, it will be a pizza party! (With the one & only Big Green Truck Pizza).However, with a majorityof our time/energy/money invested in the restaurant and considering the current Peso-Dollar exchange rate, we couldtrulycount on your support to launch the fiesta!To infinity & beyond,Samia & DavidP.S. Your contributions will cover our round-trip flights & the Big Green Truck party!

                        Hi, I'm Bree. Those of you who know me know how much Coachella means to me. I've been attending since 2001 (and have been going every year since '07) but I've always attended by myself save for a year or two. This year will be different though because by the time Coachella 2015 comes around I'll be a married woman!! There's a catch though: my fianc, Brian, lives in England while I live in LA. We will be together permanently eventually but for now we can only see each other sporadically. It's the hardest thing we've ever experienced but we're worth it! We're keeping a very small wedding (basically, we're eloping!) and with visas, travel, etc., we have many challenges ahead of us. We're going to Coachella as our honeymoon and in lieu of a wedding and wedding gifts we're asking for donations instead so that I can fly Brian out to attend with me. It'll be a dream come true! Please, if you have a moment, we'd love if you would donate to our honeymoon fund....THANK YOU!!All of the best to you and thank you, 
Brian & Bree

                        My name is Fred Martin.In 2007, I visited Uganda for the first time. While at ""Bethany Village,"" a picturesque orphan home and school on the shores of Lake Victoria, I met Patrick. At that time, he was a seventeenyear-old ward of the village. He had the deepest voice I've ever heard on a child of his age. He introduced me to his house mother (each small house has a caring teacher who lives with and cares for the kids), took me on a tour through his home, and showed off his goats.I was most impressed by his kindness toward the younger kids, his ready smile, and his desire for affection from a father figure. By the end of our time together, it became clear that I was going to become his long-distance Dad.Today, we talk regularly via facebook. He's a great singer (that deeeeeep voice) and loves to lead children's choir ministry at his church. The kids love him, and I do too.Last year, he told me that he wants to get engaged to a beautiful young woman named Ziria who he met at the YMCA Comprehensive Institute. We conspired to help him court her by paying for a few items that are traditional engagement gifts for the parents of the bride. Yes, we bought a cow. And she said, ""yes!""Here's where you come in.Patrick is $2.5 million shillings short for the wedding preparations. Sounds like a lot, huh? Actually, it's only about $750 US.A beautiful part of Ugandan culture is that the whole community comes together to help its members pay for their wedding expenses, and I want to give you an opportunity to join in the festivities!Will you help me pay for the rest of Patrick's wedding?The wedding is only 2 weeks away, so we'll have to get cracking.If you can help by giving any amount - $10, $20, $100 - I know we can help this lovely young couple a beautiful traditional wedding that will honor God and start their marriage off right!Thank you for considering a gift to help fund Patrick and Ziria's wedding. I am so grateful for your help.- Fred

IRONTON, OH                                




So, as you may know by now, WE ARE GETTING MARRIED!!!

We are so excited to be able to combine these families and spend the rest of our lives with one another. However, we could NOT have made it this far without each and every one of you. You all have made Josh and I who we are today and we cannot thank you enough!

Since Josh and I have found God we have been on a never ending journey of discovery and renewal of mind. We thought it would be selfish of us to make a formal registery when God has truly blessed us with ALL of our needs. We have pots and pans to cook, plenty of furnishings for the two of us, and a gorgeous dog who believes it all belongs to her anyway. We have truly been blessed.So we came up with this idea.... Since all of you have had a hand in our past and our present, why not extend that to our future as well?

This GoFundMe is here for one reason. To help fund our future home. Each and every one of you can play a part in thisendeavor. Whether it be $5.00 or $500.00, You can pave the way for many paint cans spilt in the garage, blender showers in the kitchen, and potty training mishaps.

Anything you can give is wildly appreciated.

After the wedding, all of the funds will be placed into our joint savings account and remain there until the day we find our future home. On that day, we will think of all of you and praise God for blessing us with such wonderful family and friends.

October 15th, 2016!!!!! Its coming up quick and we are bursting at the seams for it to be here :DWith much, much love, Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!!!-Sami

Hey guys! As most of you know, Cory & I are finally getting married! ! It's less than a year away now! We've tried to save every penny we have for our wedding. Unfortunately, life still happens to everyone. Since we have started saving, we've had to give up almost all of it to keep our car running and to help pay for many unexpected medical bills as well. So now we are asking for help to try and re-save what we've lost. Every dollar is beyond appreciated! All funds will go towards paying for things like caterers to wedding decor to helping us with our honeymoon. Like I said, anything you can pitch in is beyond helpful and greatly appreciated!! Thanks guys in advance!!

                        This page was originally set up due to having to change our wedding venue through no fault of our own. This meant we had to pay various deposits more than once & left us at risk of losing not only our original venue but also our wedding date (which is a very sentimental one to us), so an idea hatched by a friend spurred us to set up the page where donations could be made towards a 1000 deposit that we had to pay very quickly in order to save our date, in place of wedding presents. We received 380 of this 1000 which truly helped us save our wedding day, & since paying it in August, have managed to fund the rest of the wedding ourselves & secure our day in every sense.We are so grateful to those who helped, & are pleased to say that the page is now being kept open for family, friends & anyone who would like to donate towards our honeymoon, again in place of wedding gifts. We have lived together for a long time & therefore have no need for household items & such, & the only thing we could think of that we would like but currently looks unlikely, is a honeymoon. We have never had a holiday together & because we are paying for our wedding ourselves without help from family etc, at the moment it doesn't look like we'll be able to afford a honeymoon until long after the wedding. Any donations made from hereon in will hopefully make it possible for us to have our honeymoon sooner, & make it a really special first holiday together.Thank you guys, your excited brides-to-be, Hope & Clare xxx

Julie & Jeff's Family Reunification,"$3,895 ","$8,000 ",Newlyweds," October 21, 2014",33,23,SAN DIEGO,CA,148000,,,2,"

SAN DIEGO, CA                                




Jeffrey & I are getting married in Denmark in late June 2015. As a wedding gift, we do notwish for anything but a Family Reunification in Denmark. This is an expensive & difficult process, which we plan on starting once we are married.:: Our Story ::Jeff & I met in Florence, Italy, in the spring of 2012, where we were both staying at the time. Jeff was studying there on a visa & I was visiting two times throughout the year, taking Italian language lessons. We immediately fell in love & had a couple of months together, full of more love than I had ever thought possible at the time. Then July came & I had to go back to Denmark to start my Bachelors degree. We both agreed that we couldn't stop this love affair so abruptly, so we said goodbye, not knowing what was going to happen. The only thing we knew was that we had found something very special. That summer Jeff came to Denmark to visit me. He experienced the place where I grew up, met my parents and helped me get settled in my new apartment. In the fall I visited him in Florence. For christmas Jeff spent the holidays in Denmark with my family & friends that fast became his as well & visited me again in February. That following summer I went to California, because Jeff in the meantime had moved home. I stayed for an entire month & we had the most amazing summer, where I met his wonderful family & travelled California. Then in the late fall Jeff came to Denmark again for three months. We wanted to spend as much time together as possible & explore our options for Jeff to come to Denmark & stay for good. We soon found out that the only option for us was to get married & apply for a family reunification, which we can do when I'm 23 in July 2015. So we had to figure out another way for us to be together until then. I decided to apply to come study in California which got approved in the summer of 2014, where I spent 2 months with Jeff & his family in California. This was all a dream come true, until I went to get my student visa at the American Embassy in November. Here I was denied my visa, because my ties to America, in their opinion, were too strong. This was heartbreaking! Our dream of finally being together and living a 'normal' life for a while, was crushed in a second. But we couldn't give up because of that.  We quickly bounced back with the support from family & friends, & Jeff bought a plane ticket to come to Denmark for christmas, & stay until February. Our original plan was to get married in the spring in San Diego. Now this has changed, & we'll get married in the summer in Denmark instead. Jeffrey will come & spend the summer with me, until we can apply for the family reunification.:: Family Reunification ::You see, Denmark is a very small country of approximately 6 million people. It's a society built on welfare, so they don't just let anybody in. To be approved for a family reunification, you have to meet a lot of requirements. Luckily we do more or less meet these requirements. If we get approved though, we'll have to set up a bank guarantee of 52.490,12DKK which is just around 8000$. This is so the government are assured that we can support ourselves if Jeff doesn't immediately get a job & so on. This is a lot of money to us. I'm a student & we've spent a lot of money travelling back & forth trying to be together. Therefore the only thing we really need for our wedding, is this amount of money. We do not need a lot of things for a home we do not yet have. If you're interested in the rules of a Danish family reunification, you can read more about the requirements here:  http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/familyreunification/spouses/spouses.htm :: What now? ::Jeff & I are now getting married, & we couldn't be happier that so many of our family & friends, from both Denmark & the USA, can be there on such an amazing day to celebrate with us. Even a couple of friends from Florence will be showing up. You all mean the world to us. We want to say thank you for the support, encouragement & love you have contributed with to our relationship & our lives. You are our favorite people in the world.

& for all the great Danes out there: Tusinde tak for jeres sttte, krlighed og opbakning!We hope that you will support this dream of ours and we hope to be able to make our dream come true with the donations from our friends, family & kind people who believe in unconditional love.So much love,Jeffrey & Julie

The biggest issue is that we have already mailed out all of the invitations so there is no way to go back and change anything. And the worst part is that I have been working at a great job, but I'm only per diem so my hours have been cut way down and I'm trying to come up with a few hundred to pay for the biggest parts of the wedding. We would greatly appreciate any help possible. And if you are unable to help I completely understand and all I will ask of you is that you pray for us and our current circumstances in life. Thank you in advance and God bless you all.

                        Hey everyone, Im getting married in 68 days to the love of my life. What an incredible feeling! Lauren is my world and i want everything to be perfect. I've been waiting too long to marry her and i need help to make that day even more special.I don't know how much honeymoons cost, but I know they are supposed to be unforgettable.I hate asking for help with this, because I'd love to do it myself, but I can't. I know its asking a lot.If anyone would be willing to donate even the smallest amount to making this honeymoon special for her, I would be so thankful. Please feel free to make your gift to us a donation so that I can take her somewhere truly unforgettable.Thanks!

In June 2014 we brought life into the world, our beautiful son Carter was born. Already having a year and a half old, Bentley, to care for we gave Carter up for an open adoption to a wonderful family who loves and cares for him so much. It was the hardest moment in our lives. But we couldn't have asked for a better family for him to go to. We are still struggling a bit to make ends meet, between moving and switching jobs to try and better our family we just need some help from you guys to make a great and memorable wedding.

In February 2010 Jordan and his mom cameto visit Portland. Having lived nearly his whole life in Southern California, Jordan was impressed with the change of scenery the Northwest had to offer. OnNew Years Day 2011, he moved to Portland.In April of that year, Jordan and Taylor met at Henry's Tavern. After having a drink or two, they spent hours walking around the Pearl District just talking. Taylor and Jordan both knew after that first date that there was something incredibly special about each other. They spent the nextcouple of monthsdating, knowing fully that their relationship would develop further.Boy weren't we right? As you all know, we are getting married! We are using this as our registry! The morning after we get married, we are driving to Vancouver to catch a flight at noon bound for Paris. We will spend six nights there before venturing to the Mediterranean, where we will spend another six nights.Asking for the money that would probably be used on gifts like a toaster, plates, or a blender, to instead be allocated to making this an unforgettable and amazing trip, would mean the absolute world to both of us.The money would be used for a variety of things:-Museum Passes-Metro Passes-Dinners-Rental Car-Spontaneous fun things since it's our honeymoonWe both understand that this may seem non-traditional, but after living together for five years now, we both seem to have acquired more than we need. Any more stuff and poor Duggie will have to move out!We really appreciate any and all help! Even $1 would be amazing!!!!! We are so lucky to have amazing people like you in our lives, and couldn't thank you all enough for your help!

We decided that what is most important to us going forward is loving and enjoying each other. With that being said we chose not to do a huge registry for gifts but to ask those who would to take whatever they would find in their hearts and budgets to spend on gifts to instead contribute to making our honeymoon a time together that we will never forget, and look back on for the rest of our lives together here on earth.

                        Here's the deal... People all over the world pay enormous amounts of money for weddings. Some even start their marriages in debt. We would rather just try to raise some money and offset the cost. Also, if we were to do a traditional wedding it would be very hard to bring our bi-coastal families together. We figured we'd send dvd copies of the wedding out along with digital photos and maybe even a few skype viewers. We would like you all to walk this journey with us, we just do not feel that having a traditional wedding is the right fit for or very non-traditional lifestyle. I f this was 20 years ago traditionally the Father of the Bride would pay for the wedding, but for us that just isn't happening. We are from Ocean Beach, CA and pretty much love it here. However, we think a wedding in Paris sounds so romantic. So we've decided to let people into our lives and make a go at trying to get everyone involved in our story. We have been together for almost 3 years and we are ready to take the leap into marriage. We would like to ask our friends, family and pefectly beautiful strangers to invest in love. We need money to get married, that is our reality. Here it goes... Our story is most certainly not a fairy tale but it's real and we are building a life together. I met Justin at a farmers market in San Diego, CA about three and a half years ago. He was a high strung Marine that bragged about his business ventures and I was working full time as a residential youth counselor for at risk foster youth. Our paths crossed and it has taken time, patience, arguments, kindness, generosity and most importantly commitment to make this work. We have both grown and evolved together much like our relationship has. It hasn't been the easiest of roads but we have made it work and after all we have been through together I know we will spend the rest or our lives together. I have met my equal, my other half, my soul mate. Be apart of our story, invest in love. Skip the wedding gifts and donate a few bucks so we can have a small wedding in Paris, France. The money will be used towards airfare, lodging, a small chapel, a wedding dress, photographer, a flower girl dress, and a bouquet. We will be posting pictures and updates frequently so everyone can be a part of the process. We only have until the second week of November and are just trying to work this out.FYI this is our engagment announcement!!! :)With all the love in our hearts thank you!!!If you cannot donate money please don't worry just wish us luck and a lifetime full of hapiness.

So, Samantha and I are planning on getting married at the end of this March. If you want to know about who we are, please watch the video. We have plenty of ""things"" so we are not asking for traditional gifts. However, the past year and half of unemployment have taken their toll and we are multiple months behind on the mortgage and are in rapid danger of losing the house. The store is on its way to paying us, but in the meantime we have not taken any income as of yet. In lieu of wedding gifts we are asking for donations to help us keep the house from being auctioned just prior to the wedding (we've already received a March 8th auction date). Any gift of $5, $10 or more will get us that much closer to keeping the home.



Unfortunately this is a rather urgent request. We are in need of raising this amount by the end of the month. I realize this is terrible timing coming just after Christmas, but unfortunately the bank is not one to negotiate with.Thank you for your love and support and thank you for sharing this with people you know.

AUSTIN, TX                                




My name is Ian Cowart, and I am in love with my best friend and fiance Samantha Cory. We grew to be friends in Virginia Beach, VA but it wasn't until after I moved to Austin, TX to find work that we truly found each other.I proposed in April of this year, and we are planning our wedding for July2017. There is only one catch, of course - finances.We need your assistance for several interrelated reasons, and some of them will be hard to read about. (Please be advised if you are squeamish regarding bugs that you will likely be triggered during the course of reading this.)We are unfortunately in a place where we cannot move forward with completing our wedding plans until our legal issues are resolved with our previous apartment management company. We are in need of funds to retain a lawyer and counter-sue for our deposit back, as well as to build a wedding fund.

Our previous apartment was the stuff of nightmares, and what we were lead to believe was a ""minor pest problem"" was documented with pictures and videos. There was evidence of roaches everywhere . They were in the closets, on the walls, bathroom, bedroom, oven, pantry, and laundry area. They even got into the TV and would skitter around relentlessly. My fianc is still suffering from flashbacks of the 2.5 months we had to endure being crawled over and nibbled on at night by hungry roaches. Towards the end of the ordeal they were apparently quite hungry as they ate the other roaches caught in the traps, as well as the spiders and lizards that were similarly trapped. I like to think I am a typical guy as I have pretty thick skin when it comes to grossness, but it was all too much for Samantha - and nobody who has seen the evidence could ever blame her. Before this, she wasn'tafraid of roaches and there are real emotional scars where there used to just be an aversion to bugs in general. There were times I had to come home from work to help her through the panic attacks. It was incredibly depressing to have to deal with the daily realities of the infestation we faced in that hellhole. We didn't eat a single home-cooked meal during our months there as there was nowhere untouched by roaches to prepare real food safely. We spent money we shouldnt have had to spend on frozen entrees, boxed food, or takeout when we were too exhausted or depressed to eat another microwaved cup-a-noodles. We didnt trust our dishes to be sanitary so we never got around to unpacking the majority of our belongings, much less the cookware.

The fact remains that we were misled about the units condition, and we would not have moved in if their ""minor pest problem"" had been investigated before we moved in. As it stands all we can hope for is to try to get our deposit back and move on with our lives. We had consulted an attorney since it seemed like a simple case then, and moved out under a renters rights health and safety clause after the timeframe quoted for a resolution was extended from the original1-2 weeks when we moved in mid-June, all the way to an even longer 5-6 week guesstimatein August. That was the fourth time they extended the timeframe . They didnt even alert our apartment neighbors of the infestation until we asked our exterminators why they were trying to treat a single unit in the apartment building in late July  the management didnt deem it enough of an issue and continually downplayed the scope of infestation. The roaches always came right back because they had other units to move into, unlike us! We were also condescended to by an employee for criticizing their unprofessional conduct and minimizing the regular hell of being eaten alive by roaches at night. I will never take that kind of flakfrom any property company again. The move in and subsequent un-planned move out took a huge financial, emotional, and physical strain on both of us and we have not recovered yet, much less found the funds to retain a lawyer. We are simple people, and we want to move past this enduring nightmare to start the next chapter of our lives. It can't happen until we can retain legal counsel, and furthermore it won't be made right until I catch up to my goal of buying my Love the engagement ring she deserves! Im shooting for the stars with this campaign, and I know the legal fees will definitely pile up on top of the projected costs of our wedding. We want to be married here in Austin, but that just wont happen until we are free from this gigantic knot of stress in our lives. It has pushed our finances to the point of breaking, and we are hoping for $2,000 to help with the cost of legal issues and subsequent pushing-back of our bills, as well as an additional $4,000 to put towards wedding expenses including a venue and engagement ring. I know we wouldn't have been able to save that much in the time we expected to be saving, but I want to get on the right track with the love of my life. We will both be ecstaticly thankful for any and all assistance!Ihope to raise the full amount ASAP as we are staring down the barrel of piling debts. I am already thinking about how we could give back, even if only via a handwritten note to everyone. I know we can make this happen, and I thank each one of you for reading this all the way through. Please share, and if you can donate, any amount helps.She deserves it. We deserve it. Thank you so much for taking your time to read this. - Ian Cowart

                        We have been together for 12 years now and we're finally tying the knot! We are paying for the wedding and honeymoonourselves. However, this does leave us limited on funds. We created this for friends and family. I know your thinking what should I get as a wedding gift for Michelle and Neil. So instead of wedding gifts we are asking those who would like to make a ""gift"" to our honeymoon fund.
 We really don't have a large goal to meet but its greatly appreciated! Our wedding day is Saturday July 11, 2015We thank you all for any help!! 
Love,
Michelle& Neil

                        Hello there!! My name is Taylor and I'm creating this go fund me to ask for a little help toward my wedding/honeymoon. Here's why, my fianc and I have been together for over 6.5 years and just recently welcomed our son into this world in April 2016. We have been wanting to get married for a long time but everytime we started to plan something popped up financially. I currently work part time/ full time hours but help take care of my family. & house hold. That includes my son ( almost 3 months old), my mother who is disabled and has MS, my little brother (10), my fianc and myself. We(my fiance and I) take turns with jobs so one of is always home to help with the children/mother with no worries and we can't afford daycare or a home nurse, so that's our best option. Our income isn't that much and it's very hard to support all these people and plan for a wedding with such little income and such little time. I'm not asking for a million dollar wedding I just want a wedding we will remember for the rest of our lives even if it's small it will mean the world to us! Anything would help! 1$ ,50 cents, 25 cents ( it builds up). We appriciate it all!!! Our wedding is September 23rd 2016 so we have until then to reach our goal!! Please help & thanks so much for taking the time to read this

                        Hey everyone!Justin and Madison will be getting married May 28th, 2016. Since they have already lived together a decent amount of time, they have been able to collect more household items than  they will ever really need.  Therefore, the last thing they need is more stuff. Ya feel me? Their honeymoon is very important to them and they want to have the time of their lives. So with that being said, instead of giving them useless items, why not donate to a good time and life long memories? Thank you so much for making their dreams come true!

The first collegefootball game of that upcomingseason was the first timewe called each other ""Boyfriend"" and ""Girlfriend"".  Three years after that, on the weekend before our anniversary, Whitney arranged for a Groupon wine tasting tour in Tamecula, CA. He told Morgan all about it. What he didn't mention was that he had secretly planned a sunrise hot air balloon ride, where he planned to propose.  Morgansaid, ""Yes!""We would like your help to get to Europe for our honeymoon. Were going to Spain and Germany in October to experience their festivals. Every little bit helps. Our airfare, AirBnB, and adventures total around $5,000. It's a 21-hour flight to Europe and 25-hour flight home, with a layover in Moscow. We would like to make ourtrip as memorableas possible. Please consider helping us reach our Honeymoon goal.  Think of your supportas our wedding gift. Thank you all very much, Whitney Redfield & Morgan Evans

                        Hello! My name is Asia and this is my fiance Zach. We are getting married in June of 2015! :D We could not be more excited, terrified, or blessed to be starting this new journey together. Our story began about 2 years ago when Zach and I both stayed on the campus at Rochester College over the summer as student workers. He worked on the housekeeping crew and I worked on the grounds crew. So most of our encounters were in passing and just consisted of passing hello's or small talk about work or weather. As the summer went on we saw each other around more and he bagan to pursue spending time with me. At first I didn't realize that he was trying to date me, I just thought he wanted to be friends; so one day he had to sit me down and tell me what was going on. This led to a couple more months of long walks and talks as Zach patiently waited for me. As a result of all our time outside nature and God have become the things that brought us together and it is where we are most happy. Therefore we are having and outdoor/barn wedding in June. My dream has always been to have a simple county, vintage wedding with family and friends and good food. I have a beautiful dress but I can't give any details aways ;). My bridesmaids are wearing flower print sundresses of their choosing with cowboy boots and the groomsem are wearing khaki's with a white button up and suspenders and cowboy boots. Zach and I are both easy going people and we get by on very little (being two newly graduate college students). We struggle to make it from month to month but God always provides us with what we need. All we want it to be able to make our day special (which to us means being able to pay for the basics without going flat broke ;)). We hope that this day will be simple, with lots of love, laughter, and fun. After the wedding festivities we hope to head up to Mackinac City to do some camping, hiking and site seeing. Like I said before, we love being outdoors!! It is what makes our souls happy and it will be the perfect way for us to start our new life together. In order to make that happen we are asking for your help by supporting us monetarily. Whether you can give us $1 or $100 it will mean the world to us!

                        Hi! We're Lee and Jessie, and we need your help to finally fulfill our dream of having a beautiful wedding and honeymoon!For friends and family that have been asking, this IS our wedding registry. We've lived together on our own for quite a long time now, so we have no use for a materialistic-type registry that most couples have. Asking for pots and pans, stand mixers, bedding, or any of those other typical 'registry' items would simply be a waste of your money because we don't need any of those things. What we need can't be bought in a store! If you had plans to be amazing and get us something off of our registry, this is what we're doing in place of that :)So... about us if you don't already know:We started out as high school sweethearts, and now we're quickly approaching our tenth year of being together. We've been engaged for almost four years, and every single year we've made plans to get married, but the funds just have simply not been there to do so. This September, however, marks our tenth anniversary, and we don't want to keep putting it off any longer.We decided to have our wedding in Hawaii because not only is it gorgeous, but it is the most cost effective. It's essentially a wedding and honeymoon in one, and with all the great packages and bundles offered since the islands areknown for weddings, it cuts the cost in half compared to when we were looking to have a traditional wedding with all of our friends and family present. This is the only way we've seen to make it even slightly possible, butit's still just out of reach for us.Even though we've gone the financially smarter route, weddings are still expensive (we had the full cost of the wedding up previously, just as an overall goal for everyone to see, but it seemed a bit daunting so we changed it to just the extra help that we need).Even the spare dollar you might find in your back pocket or in the bottom of your purse could add up and help us book our flight, or even just eat dinner in our room one night.Lifelong friends and family members know that this has been a long time coming - we've wanted to get married for so long, and we're tired of finances holding us back from taking that next step in our lives together. As crazy as it sounds, we knew when we were 15 years old that we wanted to be together forever, now, ten years later, we'd be absolutely overjoyed if you could help our dream come true :)Please know that nothing is expected of anyone, and no amount is too small. Please don't feel bad if all you can do is share this page, or leave us a single dollar; at this point, every little bit helps us so much.We love you guys and, if you are able to help, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts, and we can't wait to share our stories and picturesof what you helped us to gain when we return. Thank you all so much <3

Hey guys, Most of you know me, for those who don't, my name is Chander Raj. Around Julyish next year (2017) Me and my fiance Alisha James are trying to do an engagement party, Now after calling multiple places all across NY, we found a reasonable place that offers $50 per person with things that we need for the party. Now that puts an amazing bill around $8,000. Now I know everyone wants us to get engaged allready, so we are trying to come up with that kind of money. Still 8k is a large sum. Thus we are using GoFundMe so get some kind of cash to help support the engagement. Every little bit helps. Thanks a lot guys.

We feel like the luckiest people on earth to have found each other, fallen in love, and now to be getting married.We made the difficult choice to have an intimate destination wedding so that we could remember and cherish every moment of this sacred event. Unfortunately that means there are a lot of friends and family who won't be there on our wedding day, but we hope you can understand and respect our wishes for this most important day in our lives.We're lucky to already have a home full of everything we need so if you wish to provide a gift, we would be so grateful if you could contribute to our dream honeymoon! After our Florida ceremony on March 11, we will be going on a 7-night cruise to the Western Caribbean and we hope to go on some amazing excursions.Thank you all so much for thinking of us on this momentous occasion and for any gift you provide. We love you all!

Originally we had a family member who was going to pay for the wedding, but because of personal reasons in the family she wouldn't be able to now... We even thought about canceling it for now till we could save up ourselfs, but because of the contract location, we can't and we will end up paying the amount no matter what..USA is tough. I feel bad because I don't like asking for help, it makes me feel weak but we really don't know what to do and both Robert and me work till 4am and we won't have enough. And don't want to get sued for the amount we owe.We are keeping a very small wedding, there is a lot of things were cutting off from the wedding, and the honeymoon might be one of them.(Photo Joey + Robert movie Night Date)Update on best man: sad to say he won't be coming anymore. He has bills to pay and we couldn't help with his plane ticket... So were cutting donations much less amount so people don't think were gonna pocket it ourselfs.We would be forever Grateful for anything, even $1.Rebecca aka Joey xoxo

Derek and I (Reema) finally got married after 12 wonderful years together! We saved every penny for the past five years to have the wedding of our dreams and were excited to celebrate our marriage with all our friends and family this summer (You!)Originally we were asking for gifts towards a honeymoon in Italy, but as life happens sometimes, weve changed gears. Derek has finally convinced me, along with friends and realtors, that the economy and housing market in Houstonis ideal for investing in a house. We want to move into an abode before the housing market ascends. An average home inside the city of Houston, between 1,200 & 1,900 square feet, is $200-500K right now. Were looking on the conservative side, butit's still a lot of money.Weve already saved up almost $5k, and are working toward saving another $10k. Our Goal is toput 20% down, and bring down our monthly expenses so we can handle any manintenence that may come up.Instead of a gift of more stuff, it would mean the world to us if you gave a monetary wedding gift to help buy our first home. Even a little bit helps. If youre old-school, well have an off-line gift/donation box at the reception Sat July 16.We appreciate every little thing!See you there!Derek & Reema Yeager

                        Hello, everyone! My name is Stefan. I'm 22 years old and I'm from Serbia.I am writing this campaign in hope that you will help me come to America this summer and be a part of Teal and Ale's wedding. This would not be just some trip for me or another wedding I have to go to, this is a chance to realize some of my lifelong dreams. I was ''spiritual'' long before I found Teal. And by spiritual I mean that I was aware of spiritual concepts about the world and the Universe, I knew about the Law of attraction, I was meditating, I read tons of books about how to make your life better and which technique to use for every problem you have. But all that theoretical knowledge and spiritual wisdom were helping less than I was willing to admit.Something was missing. And after all those ''life changing'' techniques I was still far away from living the life I wanted. And I honestly believed that going to college will somehow change everything. College was supposed to be the beginning of my new life. I hoped that new city, new people and new opportunities will help me create a better and more fulfilling life. And I did everything I could to manifest that.But a few months later I was sitting in some crappy room depressed more than ever. I couldnt believe what my ''new life'' turned out to be. Instead of enjoying the benefits of the law of attraction, I ended up living with complete strangers as my roommates in a places where having an ounce of peace or freedom was simply impossible. And that would be disappointing enough, but I soon had to accept the fact that nothing of what I was ''manifesting'' for myself happened. People who were supposed to be my new amazing friends lived in a whole different Universe. We had absolutely nothing in common, and trying to connect with them was like trying to connect with ETs.I was desperate. I have never been under so much stress and pressure in my life. Panic attacks were now a normal thing, as well as intense triggers I had to deal with on a daily basis. It was hard not to worry about what bad thing will happen the next day, when expecting the worst proved to be absolutely justified. I coped with everything by focusing completely on my classes,and ignoring the whole world around me. But that, of course, didnt work. So things got worse. Being exhausted and overwhelmed by everything, I woke up one day at 7 oclock to go to class, but then realized it was 7PM, not 7AM. I couldnt even function anymore. And because every life changing technique has failed me and I didnt know how to help myself and how to deal with everything, in less than a year I developed a various health issues. I was now struggling with breathing issues, sinus problems, hair loss, allergies, chronic fatigue and severe insomnia. It was around that time I found Teal. I watched one of her videos when she ''accidentally'' appeared on YouTube one day. And after that I watched another, and then another and another and you know how that goes. Soon I was listening to Teal and doing shadow work instead of studying for exams, and I started skipping classes to go in nature and do inner child work. For years and years I couldnt feel anything. I knew I was in a lot of pain but I couldnt really feel it. I didnt know how. I even tried so many times to make myself cry by watching the most heartbreaking movies and by playing the saddest and most depressing music I could find. But nothing ever worked. I would just sit there with no reaction. Completely numb. I was dead. I had no reactions to the world around me. My life was a living hell. And Teal pulled me out of that hell. She set me free. Thanks to her I can feel again. Thanks to her I have my life back.Teal helped me understand myself more. She helped me meet my true self and find out what I really want. She helped me understand what kind of power our negative beliefs have over us. But also,she helped me understand the power I have over them. I can now choose what I want to believe in. I can pick my own beliefs. Thanks to Teal I started questioning everything I was thought about myself, other people, the world, the Universe (God), and the life itself. She helped me realize that there is solution to every problem. And that you dont need to be most powerful or the most conscious person in the world to find it. She helped me ground my spiritual practice. She helped me understand that Im not alone. She showed me that there are millions of people around the world feeling the same way I feel, facing the same problems Im facing and doing the same things I was doing. And the best of all, she showed me that there is someone fighting for all of us! <3I couldnt believe how someone youve never met can affect your life so much and understand you more and help you more than real people from real life. It was as if instead of giving me everything I wanted by thing the Universe said: ''Teal is the answer! '' And she really was. :)I was blown away. And Im sure you know what happens when you are blown away by something or someone. You want to tell everyone about it. You want to share it with others who will be excited about it like you are. But I never had a chance to go to any of Teals workshops before, and I never met any other Tealer for all this years.And thats why I was beyond happy when I saw that there is a chance to attend Teal and Ales wedding. I wrote a letter so excited for finally having a chance to tell Teal how much I love her and how thankful I am for everything she does.And then I got my answer. It was 4AM in Serbia when Ale sent me an email saying that Teal and he decided to invite me to their wedding! He told me they opened 23rd spot for me and suggested that I start this GoFundMe campaign.After crying for like an hour, I started thinking about how amazing this is. I will finally meet Teal. I will finally tell her how much I love her and how happy I am for her and Ale. I will be a part of their wedding. And knowing that I can add to their happiness makes me even more happy. It would be a blessing to share my love and happiness with other amazing people on that wedding. It would be a blessing to be surrounded by really conscious people who gathered to consciously celebrate true love :) I think that this whole trip will make my life richer and more beautiful. And maybe after the wedding I will have that new life I wanted for so long.And yes, not only that Im excited about Teal and Ales wedding, I also cant stop thinking about coming to America! Coming to America is a dream that my entire childhood revolved around. And now, all of that can really happen!!! :) Now, once again, Teal gave me a chance to change my life!I couldnt sleep for days after that email Ale sent me. Some of my friends decided to help me with this campaign because they know how much this means to me. So we took this beautiful picture in the park (Im wearing a shirt with ''T'' letter). But now I need your help too.Coming to America wont be easy. Besides the money I need, I have to apply for visa and getting your visa approved from a country like Serbia is not easy, especially now with Syrian refugee crisis unfolding across Europe and our county. People from embassy are very strict about everything, and one of the things they expect of me is to prove them that I have enough money for everything Ill need on this trip. And I dont.Ive never had or seen $2000 in my life. Thats actually more money than my dads annual salary. So even if we all start saving up, it just wont be enough. And thats the minimum amount of money the embassy expects you to have if you are staying in America for a week or less.So I want to ask all of you to help me by donating any amount you can or just by sharing this campaign with others. It would mean a world to me to be on this wedding! :) Please know that your money will be refunded in case my visa application is denied.Thank you very much!I love you all! <3*This GoFundMe page and letter was written and created by Stefan Petruevski. Because GoFundMe is not supported in Serbia, Cody has been asked to set up this page and transfer the funds over to Stefan once the goal has been reached.

Get Gus & Jessie To Their Wedding!!,"$3,708 ","$3,500 ",Newlyweds," August 10, 2016",111,1,BURBANK,CA,441000,,10,2,"

                                                            on behalf of Jessie Caballero

BURBANK, CA                                





                        HI GUYS! A PUBLIC UPDATE TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ALL WHO DONATED AND NO NEED TO DONATE ANY MORE!! WE GOT GUS AND JESSIE TO THEIR WEDDING ON TIME, THEY HAD AN EXQUITE AND INTIMATE WEDDING, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU/US MADE THIS HAPPEN. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE MAGIC OF A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIRACLE.KEEP MAKING MIRACLES,LOVE NICOLA. ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN FOR POSTERITY AND INSPIRATION:--Our beautiful beautiful friends Gus and Jessie need our help getting themto their OWN wedding!!They are getting married this weekend on Friday 12th August in a forest in Seattle. They have been preparing for over a year, lovingly restoring and rebuilding a trailer from the inside out to take them on this gorgeous adventure into married life.The Trailer is named Pierre. I'm not sure why. I will ask them when they are less stressed. But It's a great name.Gus and Jessie are from LA and have chosen to have a private and sacred Ceremony in the forests of Seattle, with just their officiant, a photographer and a videographer, filming the wedding. Then in the fall they are having a celebration in Texas for all their families and friends, where they will be screening the video of this weekend's Sacred Marriage Ceremony in the Forest. They have been working all year on this Trailer to enjoy during their wedding adventure. All year. It's been a labor of love that they have been sharing with their community on their blog and on instagram, and finally finally finished it last week. It is so beautiful and so meaningful, with so many precious and special touches.Above their bed is a beautiful embroidered map of the US State Flowers that Jessie's Aunt Sharlene embroidered. Jessie posted a picture of it on facebook last week with a note that said that herAunth Sharlene, who passed away last August, embrodiered this map of the US State Flowers decades ago and Jessie's mom and Aunt Joyce gifted it to her and Gus for their trailer. She said it was the first piece of art hung in their little house on wheels and they couldn't feel happier about it.And this below is the final finished amazingly awesome love-filled home that they built with their own two hands and set off in last week to go get married.The plan was to drive and camp and adventure through Yosemite and other beautiful parts of the Country as part of the getting hitched journey, which they did this past week. You can check out their pics at: #ragmopandgoosegethitchedBut alas alas, 2 days ago they left for Lake Tahoe, on their way to Seattle, for their wedding this weekend, and 3 hours into the trip, calamity struck.Their SUV that they were driving overheated and the breaks on their car completely shut down while they were going downhill on a Mountain edge. Did I mention they had A TRAILER BEHIND!! The car had overheated and everything just stopped working. The brakes stopped. The engine stopped. Everything just stopped. While they were driving. Down a Mountain. They stayed calm. Amazingly. Survival instincts kicked in. (Thank you Evolution.) And as they were heading straight for a cliff, and Jessie saw Gus pumping at the breaks to no avail, she suddenly pulled the emergency break, and Gus somehow managed to steer the vehicle and the trailer to a pull stop on the side of mountain. Only then did Jessie let herself burst into tears.When they got out the car, there was no cell reception, so they made a handmade sign (it's starting to sound like a movie.) And finally got their car towed to a mechanic in Nevada, where they have been waiting and paying the past day and a half for it to be fixed. They have now found out that it's a problem with the engine that certainly can't be fixed in time for their weddingand may not be able to be fixed at all, so they are having it towed back to California.And now, three days before their wedding, they are essentially stranded in a parking lot in Nevada, with their magical trailer full of their things and their animal babies, when they are supposed to be on their way to Seattle to meet their officiant for their forest wedding.They tried to get a rental car but there isn't a rental car in the vicinity that can tow the wedding trailer, and their airbnb they have rented for their wedding night is a 12 hour drive from the parking lot in which they are right now stranded.They and their little cuties (Scotty Pippen and Little Monster) are exhausted and trying to keep their spirits high, but this certainly isn't how anyone wants to go into a wedding that they have been planning and building for for over a year. At the end of the day, we are all grateful that they are safe and alive, as are they. And they are super humble and would never ask for themselves, but can we rally as a community, can we raise enough money to get them a car? Can we get people from every state, like the flowers from every state hanging over their bed, to come together and get them to the forest on time? Or can we find a car company that could come in and save the day and provide them with a vehicle to get to their Wedding?I believe in miracles. And I believe in Love. And I believe that when we come together, particularly to honor an important and sacred rite of passage like the marriage of two beautiful, kind people, we can make magical things happen.Let's share this far and wide. Let's give $7 or $11 bucks each and let's get Gus and Jessie and their animal babies to their wedding in the forest on time and give them a Wedding that they will remember forever and ever and ever...And then we'll all get to see the beautful video!!!Timing is obviously of the essence, so this is really a 24 hour situation. Can you share this now? With everyone you know??? Thank You Thank You Thank You!!!!From their hearts and from ours. Thank You.(Gus and Jessie + Scotty Pippen and Little Monster.)

Post Tragedy Honeymoon,"$6,242 ","$5,000 ",Newlyweds," March 9, 2016",87,6,SAN MARCOS,CA,421000,,,2,"






                            Christopher Graves
                            
                                                            on behalf of Jennipher Lorber

SAN MARCOS, CA                                




Hello, my name is Christopher Graves and my wife Karen and I have the privaledge of knowing an amazing couple named Jennipher and Brian Lorber and this go-fund-me post is for them. We've been close friends with Jen and Brian for roughly 7 years and were very sad to see them leave San Diego to move to Montana in 2012. Jen's amazing Mom Deb, a real estate agent in Helena, couldn't have been more excited to have her daughter and son-in-law move up to her town and she immediately assisted them in finding a forever home even being featured in an episode of ""House Hunters,"" ( http://helenair.com/news/local/house-hunters-to-feature-couple-s-search-for-home-in/article_3473689e-5cb5-11e3-9adf-0019bb2963f4.html) Fortunately my wife and I were still able to maintain our friendship even over the large distance. Finally in 2013 Brian proposed to Jen after years of saving and delays and their wedding was on June 2nd, 2014. After their wedding they had planned on taking a dream honeymoon to Thailand that same year but were sadly beset by personal disasters that drained their savings starting with a major surgery for their dog that same year and then in 2015 being forced to replace a roof on their home. Finally last summer, they made firm plans for their dream honeymoon and booked it for late February, 2016. They decided to invite friends to come with them and my wife Karen and I were one of the lucky friends to be close enough to earn an invite. In total they planned to meet up and celebrate with two different couples and one single friend while in Thailand. Jen and Brian have two weiner dogs named Guiness and Lady and Jen's mom volunteered to watch her ""granddogs"" while they embarked on their honeymoon and drove them several hours away to the airport to send them off.  Jen and Brian arrived in Phuket, Thailand a day earlier than we did. As soon as we reached baggage claim in Phuket my wife used the free wifi in the airport to reach out to Jen and Brian and tell them that we had landed and would be seeing them within the hour. It is then that Jen texted Karen that her mom Deb had fallen down the stairs in her own home's basement and was in critical condition and on life support with her husband Harry at her side. Just like that their honeymoon was over and Jennipher's life would never be the same. Jen and Brian were rushing to the airport to immediately fly home to be with her mom since obviously family is always more important than friendship and vacations. After nearly 30 hours of traveling exactly one day after they landed in Thailand they arrived back in Great Falls, Montana where her mom was on life support. It turned out she had suffered major head trauma from falling down the stairs and was brain dead. On February 27th, 2016 at the young age of 64, Debra Smith was taken off of life support with her family and friends at her side and she passed away shortly after. She was kind, inspirationally passionate for life, beautiful, happy, bubbly, caring, selfless and overall an incredible human being and mother to Jen. I debated putting Jen's own facebook post here from the day Deb passed away being that it is clearly so personal but I think it's too powerful to ignore and more than I could ever say;Jennipher Lorber feeling heartbroken.February 28 at 10:05pm  Great Falls, MT Today my grief is more than one soul should ever endure. I lost my motherDebra Smith. My best friend. My everything. I am broken. I am lost. I am beyond console. I can't even breath.Why did this happen to someone so young and so full of life?How will I never hug her or laugh with her again? How do I go on? Will I ever laugh again?I have small comfort in knowing how truly blessed I was to be born to her.How incredibly fortunate we were to have the loving bond that we had.No one had a mom like mine and I count my blessings every single day.Thank you Mom for your wisdom and guidance and love and friendship. My world is forever better because you were my mother. Thank you! I love you as big as the world is round!!!Life can be unfair and cruel. Deb didn't deserve this, she had decades of life to live. She was more than just a mother to Jen, she was her best friend. Nothing will ever change what happened but our goal here is to find a way to bring a sliver of happiness to a tradegy too terrible to comprehend. Instead of buying flowers or sending a card with our condolences, we want to do this. We want to prove to Jen that there is still happiness in her future and there are good people everywhere that care for her. My hope here is to put enough money together for her and Brian to take that honeymoon that was tragically cut short. I plan on keeping this a semi secret from them for now being that the funeral isn't even until March 12th but after two or three weeks I will bring them in on this post and any donations will go straight to them.They received virtually no refunds on prepaid excursions, hotels or end of trip flights and incurred a huge bill for their emergency international flight. This after 2 years of penny pinching and saving for their honeymoon.  A vacation will never heal that hole that Jen has in her soul or bring her mom back but just maybe a honeymoon funded from love from friends, family and complete strangers will start to heal her heart. Perhaps in a sad way this could be perceived as a last gift from her Mom. Thank you for taking the time to read my (Jen and Brian's) story and I hope this will make a difference for two incredible and deserving people. For those who donate, I can only say thank you for being an amazing, kind person and that you've made a difference. Thank you.

                        Matthew and I got married on June 4th 2016. We originally set this up to get donations towards our honeymoon. On June 6th 2016 we were going to leave for Florida but were awaken by our building catching on fire. We got a couple trips to collect our personal items but lost many things due to water damage and lack of time. Anything helps in the tough time. We thank everyone who helps us tremendously and again thank you.

Chris & Hannah's Honeymoon,"$3,395 ","$5,000 ",Newlyweds," January 18, 2016",50,8,HELOTES,TX,414000,,,1,"

                     She said yes!   Hannah and I started dating in May 2015, andbelieve me, that was a miracle in itself! I'll admit that I became fond of her first.Wemet during a Spurs Championship playoff game whenour two small groups decided to hang out together. I'm not sure if it was her pure beauty or the atmosphere of the Spurs winning their 5th Championship, but I was hooked.  It wasn't until a few months later that she actually gave me a chance. And guess what? She actually liked me too. However, the butterflies in our stomachs were just half of the confirmation in this relationship. Through prayer and through God's prophetic voice in others, we knew that this was right!  Needless to say, we began dating and continued to be smittened by each other. Fun is one of many words that can describe what our dating life has been. So within 2 weeks of our first date I found myself in a Jared's store looking at engagement rings. I wasn't entirely sure when I'd propose, I only knew that one day I would. And that day came a lot sooner than I expected.   One week later Hannah and I drove up to The Cross at Kerrville where I got down on one knee at the foot of the empty cross to ask Hannah to marry me. She said yes!  We get married on June 10, 2016 and we couldn't be happier. We're also grateful that the Lord has blessed us with household items to start our marriage. Therefore, we decided to ""register""for our honeymoon instead of wedding gifts.  Hannah is a Kindergarten teacher, so she will be off for our honeymoon and I have been blessed to take my sabbatical during this time. Thus, we'll be spending two weeks in my homeland of Hawaii where we'll get to have fun, spend time together, and visit some of my family members who will not be able to attend our big day. Most honeymoons last 5 to 7 days, but ours will last 18 days. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to have a dream honeymoon!

Tying The Knot of Our Love...,$786 ,"$10,000 ",Newlyweds," January 18, 2016",9,8,KILAUEA,HI,407000,,1,1,"






                            Jamie Bhavani Eversage
                            
                            
                                                           
KILAUEA, HI                                




Aloha to all our loved ones, near and far, but ever present in our hearts ~Jamie and Jonathan joyfully invite you to join in the celebration of our love and union on the 23rd of January.As our marriage draws nearer, many have asked what gifts we would like to receive for this blessed occasion. For practical reasons, we have decided against a wedding registry. As you may or may not know, we are currently (and happily!) sharing a tent on the beach in Kauai until we find a more permanent home here, that suits all of our needs. Sitting amongst the piles of our ever-accumulating things, it simply isnt possible for us to receive the sort of gifts traditionally offered for a wedding, for lack of space to keep them. ;-)However, many of you still have expressed the desire to contribute in some way to us, as we step forward into our fresh, exciting lives together. We honor your love and compassion and wish to offer our manifestations to youWe wish to establish our home base here on the island of Kauai. For us, it is the epitome of paradise. We thrive in the lush beauty, abundance, and vitality this island has to offer. We wish to manifest our dream homestead here. Whether we build or simply live in a home already on a lot, we wish to be able to sublet the property year round. We consider our main focus to be volunteering with Amma for her humanitarian organization Embracing the World, and the support of this income would help us to fund our travels around the globe. This home would be available for us to come back to when needed, serving as a jumping off point for our adventures. The land would offer enough space to garden, set up a nursery, and keep bees. A workshop would be in place for Jonathan to create his exquisite Kahelelani shell jewelry, and Jamie to experiment in the kitchen with raw baking delights. We both long to be able to give back to our community, establishing a space for satsang, where others can come together to practice yoga, sing kirtan, and share a meal regularly. Caring deeply for the environment, we both yearn to give back to the earth, over time planting one million trees around the world.At the moment, our dreams are merely seeds to be sown, visions we wish to co-create together as one. Humbly, we offer our manifestations for the upliftment of the world, to serve those in need and to restore balance to nature.We feel that tying the knot of our Love is only the beginning Interwoven, the colors of our dreams dance and play on the blanket of our destinies.Mahalo ~

                        Hi Everyone!Please help us transform this long distance relationship into a long lasting relationship....Charles and I have had a special connection since that fateful day we locked eyes in Las Vegas. I was there to witness my best friends brother marry the woman of his dreams and Charles was there with his family as his brothers dying wish was to see the Grand Canyon.For the following year, Charles and I continued to grow as friends across many miles, spanning from Cinncinati, Ohio, U.S. to my, tiny town; Kenora, Ontario. Our friendship blossomed into love and Charles made the trek (for his first time ever) to visit Canada.Fast forward to August 16, 2013, we said our vows in a small, intimate ceremony, barefoot in my front yard and took off back to Vegas for our honeymoon (by fate, I won a trip for 2 to the place it all began!).A few days after our special day, reality hit and Charles had to return to Cincinnati.Being in love with (and married to) someone from a different country comes with challenges that are out of our control (immigration laws). Unlike what most people think, in order to be together in the same country, its not just about getting married. There is a lot of paperwork and expenses that go along with it.After 8 agonizing months apart, Charles and I took a leap of faith and decided to pack our backs and travel to Kauai.Fast forward 6 months, we have decided that we want to make Kauai our home.

                        My name is Keshia and my fiance's name is Mark. We met and fell in love with each other in high school at the age of 15. We are raising funds to pay for our wedding as our funds were lost when Elaborate Events in Duluth GA closed their venue without any warnings.We've paid Elaborate Events thousands of dollars to have our dream wedding at their venue on August 20th, 2016. I just happened to go onto their website and to my surprise there were very negative reviews about them closing their doors. I couldn't believe this was happening to us! Our wedding is one month away! We are not rich to throw money like that away! I tried calling but to no avail. We visited the location and sure enough they are closed with padlocks on the doors. They walked away with our money without advising us they were in financial difficulties or whatever their reasons were for doing what they did.We are now faced with the burden of finding funds to pay for another venue with short notice, so we are asking for your assistance to help make our day special.We will be totally greatful for any assistance you can give.Thank you

Just some silliness with the love of my life this week...Update: 8/9/2016 Linda and I were engaged this week.Linda: ""It all began about 20 years ago. I was at a downtown coffee shop called Old Vienna that was my home away from home. I was sitting out front when I saw a very interesting man who appeared to be the love-child of Art Garfunkel and Woody Allen. I was inexorably drawn to him, to the point where I was obviously staring and didn't care. The energy was palpable. I said to myself, *SELF, you can't let this person leave without meeting them* so contrary to my comfort zone, I approached him and said something like, *I am insinuating myself into your conversation because I find you very intriguing, and I can't let you leave without meeting you...* Fortunately, he was friendly and open and invited me to walk with him to Subway at midnight to get a veggie sub. I was hooked before we ever spoke. <3""Jonathan: ""We reconnected about five years ago, we took a beautiful trip to Tennessee last year you may recall from my emails.Linda wanted rain, it rained... synchronicities as if the universe was cojnspiring in our favor, or we simply were being true and in tune, everything was just magical... spending time together at Mount Soledad, the beach, Hotel Del Coronado, exploring the place where our favorite movie, Somewhere in Time was written... meeting remarkable people... it was all a dream, it was all so perfect.Linda and I talked about getting each other promise rings as a reminder and galvanizing symbol of the goal of our future together... so last night we were looking but it was all from China and I wasn't really feeling the connection... today the train stopped in Albaquerqueu for an hour and I got out and I saw a row of sales tables and a lovely older Native American woman selling pairs of adorable, locally sourced silver and turquoise rings, sent off a photo to Linda, and they were perfect.Now comes the hard part of saving money to move me out to San Diego so we can really begin our lives together.""Share our journey.Thank you.~Jonathan and Linda.~*~

                        Avengers, assemble!This is Cayla and Colin. You want to see love? Look at them, they're super grossly in love. They're just too adorable for words.Cayla and Colin were married this past weekend in one of the most tear-jerkiest weddings ever attended. The love levels of the room were at critical massas we all danced the night away. But sadly, this joy was overshadowed by a thief. This piece of human garbage not only stole Cayla's wedding band, but proceeded to also steal the majority of cards and gifts that their family and friends intended to give them. So, needless to say, that sucked the biggest suck ever and really put a damper on the night's event. These are two of the kindest, most phenomenal people to ever exist, and truly do not deserve to have to deal with this insanity. They should be laughing, drinkingcaf au laits, and thinking, ""Wowie, we're honeymooning in sunny Indianapolis!"" Instead, they are taxed with endless phone calls to friends and family to cancel checks, and fruitless back and forths with the police. The future of Cayla's wedding band is rather bleak, so let's band (pause for laughter)together and get her a new one! Funds raised will be used to acquire new bling, and also help them begin this new chapter in their lives. Let's show this thief that love always wins.If you donate, thank you in advance for your love and support, you're all amazing human beings. If you don't, then you're dead to me. (Just kiddding, nothing but love here.)

Salena and Corey's Big day,$450 ,"$1,000 ",Newlyweds," June 20, 2016",9,3,ATLANTA,GA,226000,,1,1,"

ATLANTA, GA                                




Greetings everyone! My name is Salena Meyers from Atlanta, Georgia. Honestly the last thing I wanted to do was start a go fund me account, not because everyone is starting one, but because of the negative light that has been shined on it. Alot of people have have usedthis tool as a selfish gain to scam and pond on people,but iamusing this tool as a means to make a very special day, even grand. I am getting married this December to my college sweetheart.
 Corey and I met at Atlanta Metropolitan College our freshman year. We met in a time in both our lives where we were experiencing pain, and changes. We were children playing an adult game. Somethings stripped us so bare that we had no choice but to cling to each other. One of the things was the lost of our first child.That pain alone was enough to send me out of my wits. Corey was nothing more than supportive and stayed by my side all the while.
 Two months later I found out I was pregnant again. This time things went without a hitch. I was miserable, happy, and pregnant during the summer of 2009, he was dueon October 25th, so I had the whole entire summer to be miserable, but Jordan and my body had other plans. He was born a whooping 1lb and 14 oz of fight on July 29th. He stayed in the NICUfor 3 1/2 months. Thoses were the worst 3 months of my life. He made it through though. He fought everyday for his life an we were grateful for that.
 Every day life hitched on, and we were parents, college students, and working to help provide for our family. We struggled, and in result we made the decision to quit school, and work full time. That time in our live we grinded to keep a roof over our head. For about two years we really did struggle. So I decided to go back to school.
 Around that time my mother saw delays in Jordan, and that prompt me to get him tested. He was diagnosed with ASD(Autism Spectrum Disorder). The news of this diagnoses was scary. I worried for my child, as I do now, but Corey assured me that we would get through it , we did and we stillare. Having a child with autism is no easy feat. Even the smallest things like going to a grocery store would upset him, and cause him to kick and scream. I remember getting some of the most dirty looks from other consumers, thinking that I just had a spoiled brat on my hands. Not knowing the truth behind his meltdown. Not knowing that I was melting down on the inside, trying to gain control of the situation. 
 Life got better as we got the therapy he needed, and gothim into school. Corey was so good at teaching him, (and he still is) patient with him, and a real loving father. Something at the time me and Corey had yet to experience.So I finally decided to go back to school, and enrolled into Brown Mackie College in 2012.Along with the challenges of dealing with a child with autism, andthewear and tear of our relationship over the years caused usto make a decision to split, and move into different homes and be coparents to my son Jordan (my daughter wasnt born yet, I didn't even know I was pregnant). We decided to create a friendship so that ur son would still know that he came from love.
One Monthafter I moved into my own place, I found out I was pregnant with Aaliysa. It was a shock, that came three months after I graduated with an associates degree in Surgical Technology and two weeks after I started my career at Atlanta Medical Center. We were happy, even though the circumstances were not ideal. We got over our differences, and continued to forge a friendship that no person could break. Corey became my bestfriend, something that we didn't TRULY have a concept of previous years ago.We grew close again, and I knew that I wanted my kids to see the love that their father and I share. I am excited that we get to continue to fight for our realtionship and our family. 
 We learned so much over the years, one of many thingsis you can't do it all alone.We are asking your help to make our day special, and take some of the stress away from the planning. Every donation will go towards that special day in december, and our honeymoon. Whether it is a dollar or 25 cent, It will mean the world to me and my family to make this day special. Even if you do not donate, the well wishes and the sharing of this page will not go unnoticed, and will be very appreciated!!!

PLEASE SHARE THIS PAGE EVEN IF YOU DO NOT DONATE. I post this in the name of love, and family.

                        We are getting married! In leu of traditional registry gifts, we are instead asking that you considerdonating money. Your generous donations will allow us to actually go on a honeymoon!We took off a week in December so that we can go someplace warm. A honeymoon was originally not on the books due to costs, but we decided to try going this route instead. We would never be able to afford a vacation/honeymoon otherwise, so this is our chance to do something fun to relax after this semester is over for me at RCTC. If you don't feel comfortable donating via GoFundMe, feel free to donate cash or checks at the wedding, or through the mail. It is so very much appreciated!!Thank you everyone, from the bottom of our hearts.Mark Lundberg & Sarah Matt

We have lived together for some time now, so we decided traditional wedding gifts such as appliances, dishes, silverware, etc., might not be the best idea. In lieu of gifts like these, we're asking our family and friends to donate money in order for us to have our dream honeymoon! We hope we're able to go to Puerto Rico or Jamaica, and either would be amazing.Thank you all so much for thinking of us on this momentus occasion and for anything you are able to provide! We love you all!

                                                Hello,My name is Erik and I'm writingon the behalf of my fiance, Yana, and myself.We created this fund to help with one of the costs of our wedding, which is the plane ticket. It will cost around $900-$1400. She lives in Bulgaria. Any donation would be much appreciated and we would be so grateful.BackgroundYana and my story began on April 2014 in Jena, Germany studying abroad in the FSU (Friedrich Schiller Universitt) cafeteria at an event for international students. I sat there sitting next to another student from my PA college that went with me studying abroad. Yana knew my friend because they shared a German student who acted as there advisor. Yana decided to sit next to us and we began chatting. My German at that time was pretty freaking awful and I just began spitting off the only german I knew which was information on myself. Information like my family, where i lived, etc. Yana sat there either baffled by my horrible grammar or she was confused why this american just started spewing random noncensicle information. Yana humoured me and gave me her life story. She began to explain she was from a country called Bulagria. I looked at her with a smile and cocked my head to the side like a confused dog, ""Where is that?""So the begining of our freindship started out with me looking ignorant. However, despite the rocky introduction Yana, Anna (the other american girl), and I became something like the three muskateers. For the first two months of our study we were just friends enjoying Germany and having the time of our lives. Yana and I became closer friends sharing more life stories and finding out how much we really had in common. However, we were still not romantically involved, even though our friends could clearly see something between us.The Aha moment came in the begining of June when we finnally gave into our feelings for each other and admitted to each other. From that point on we were pretty inseperable we did so much in such little time. Savoring every moment because we knew that at the end of the summer I would return to America and she would go back to Bulgaria. One of the last things we did before we left was go to Vienna Austria. This was very specail to me because my family were missionaries in Vienna Austria and I grew up there from when I was 4 months till about 8 years old. We saw my old house where I balled my eyes out infront of her. At that point I started to realize Yana knew me more than anyone else in my life. She understood me even if we both didn't speak the nativelanguage. I knew this was something special, someone special, something I could not just let slip away because we were worlds apart.However, I still had to go home and she had to go home. We video called eachother for 4 months until i decided to take a trip to go see her and Bulgaria. I went there for two weeks and on the first weekend, I broke my leg.Even with that, we managed to make it work and it still was an amazing trip and great cultural expierence.When I returned home I moved to Detroit and started my career in accounting. I tried to get Yana into the US but it was a nightmare for 7 months we tried everything and I saved up money. The last thing we looked into was getting married, a serious decison for two people in their early 20's. We decided to try one more thing before considering that. However, another dissapointing failure and back to the drawing board. I grew impatient and finally snapped.I turned down a accounting postion at a corporation and went to Bulgaria for three months to find out...is this love? Is this the one? Had to find out.I thought my summer in Germany was the time of my life, but living with Yana for that summer and working as an English teacher was by far the happiest I've ever been. I asked for her hand in marriage. Could not afford the typical diamond ring, she would not want it anyways. At the end of those three months I still had to go home and this time I was leaving my fiance behind.When I returned home it was one hardship after another. The frame of my car broke so I had to scrap it and that meant no job. I moved back in with my parents back to coal cracking PA. They let me use their spare car and I went out job hunting. I have three jobs now with odd hours and pick up an accounting gig once in awhile.But its still not enough.EndI made this with the hope that my friends and famliy would see it and consider it as a wedding gift since mostly everyone in my life wont be able to come to my wedding in Bulgaria. If this fund flops and I get nothing it will not stop me. I am commited to my decision. I realize that there are so many other noble causes out there to be funded. So many people struggling to survive. By all means pass over this and go fund them. If you do decide to donate, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. It will be one less thing for us to dwell on and I will be one step closer to never having to say goodbye to her again without knowing when I will see her again.E & Y

Taking full advantage of the opportunity, Kyle managed to roll his four-wheeler on the most unassuming flat stretch of the trail, incurring a bit more damage than anyone had in the plan. With nobody hurt and stories to tell the trip was a success and we are all asking for a little help to cover the cost from the four-wheeler. Every little bit helps. Thanks in advance!

SNELLVILLE, GA                                





                        So after getting engaged on January 10th we quickly decided we wanted to have a non traditional wedding. Courtney loves Halloween and it just so happens it's on a Saturday this year, which left us with 9.5 months to make this happen. I proposed on January 10th because on that day in 2014 I had double hernia surgery and Courtney stepped up and proved she would be by my side. We had only been together about 6 months but it was the bond created then that sealed our love for each other. Unfortunately that surgery was completely out of pocket at over $7,000 including the trip and then the very next month I was hit for another $2,300 for septic tank repair.So here we are, recovering from that debt while trying to plan a wedding and that's where you come in. We don't need plates & silverware & other stuff people register for during a wedding, we just want to have a fun wedding for us AND the guests. We're trying to keep the budget low so even if we don't make our goal, I think we can pull this off.As a bonus incentive, any donation of $150 or more will receive a commemorative knife from Diabolique Kustoms (Chad's knife company) to be delivered near the wedding date.So whadda ya say, can you help us out here?Chad & Courtney

                        For those of you who don't know, Catie Mae and her fiancmovedto Salt Lake Citylast year from Georgia to be close to her mom, whose cancer came back for a second time, only this time much much worse. She was planning her wedding to be thisSeptember but was told yesterday by doctors that if she wants her mom at her wedding, she needs to move the date way up. As you can imagine the stress of being told that she is about to lose her mother, she now has to plan a wedding in a matter of a few weeks so her mom can be there. It is her ONE wish in life to have her mom witness her get married and she would be absolutely devastated ifshe was not there.Because she can no longer do her big wedding she's been planning,a couple of her close friends and family members are trying to put together a small ceremony very soon so that her mom can be there. We want to make it as beautiful andasspecial for them as possible. Weddings are obviously expensive and this last minute turn of events puts her in a tough spot financially.If youare able to donate any money so that we can make this as special as possible,we would GREATLY appreciate it. Seriously, anything helps.

Help get my wife to the USA,$570 ,$500 ,Newlyweds," July 12, 2016",10,2,HOUSTON,TX,165000,,,3,"

HOUSTON, TX                                




Hey everybody! As you may or may not be aware, my wife Sophie and I got married last month on June 11th of this year. It was a beautiful (albeit small) ceremony and we couldn't have had a better day if we tried.

But now, we're trying to move back to my country of origin (the US.) I'm still a US citizen, and although we're married in Germany, I cannot apply for work due to restrictions on my residence permit (which we're in talks to fix.) This is an issue, as it turns out filing for an immigrant visa, fees from the USCIS, and other travel expenditures are NOT cheap. Now, if you're wondering why we can't just settle down in Deutschland: it is much easier for me to work in the US, as job applicants are looked at by order of priority (highest to lowest): natural German citizen, EU citizen, foreign immigrant. This puts me at the bottom of the totem pole (despite 7 years work experience in my field!) Sophie has a mental disability (major depression and a panic disorder) that unfortunately prevents her from working.

What this GoFundMe is funding, specifically, is the immigrant fee payable to USCIS once Sophie has been approved for her immigrant visa ($165), airline luggage (two suitcases, going as cheap as possible would run approx. $100), any additional filing fees for USCIS forms outside of the I-130 (approx. $200), and train/bus fare to Frankfurt one time to get our marriage legitimized in the United States, at the US Consulate in Frankfurt (approx. $35, or 30 EUR)

We would need this campaign to meet it's goal as soon as humanly possible, as according to the USCIS.gov website, spousal immigrant visas are issued in a shorter time frame than other types of immigrant visas, and this financial hurdle is the last thing keeping us from settling down in the States. For those of you wondering what happens AFTER the ""final plane ride"", I am in talks with a former employer to resume my old position in manufacturing, and would be signing a lease shortly afterward.

I'll be frank with you guys, ANY contribution to this gets us one step closer to throwing Magic cards at each other from a closer distance than a webcam (with considerable lag), and gets my loving wife introduced to my extended family stateside. It would mean the world to the both of us to receive anything, no matter how small.

Love you all (and hope to see you soon!)

                        When we first met, we instantly knewwe were about to be taken on an incredible adventure. It was already so clear to us that we were walking towards marriage after only speaking a few days. We were in awe of God's goodness and blessings and we were so excited to pursue one another.From the beginning, this love story has felt special.We have been able to experience huge life moments in the short time we've been together. We even got to travel to another country across the world together!Now it's time we take on this adventure we call marriage, together. And, boy, are we overwhlemed with joy!Over the last few months, we've realized what lies in our hearts about this wedding and therefore are doing what we've desired all along. An intimate, small gathering out of town, at the end of August. Because of this, many of our friends and even some family may not be able to make it.We've also realized this gives us a lot less time to save for things, especially our honeymoon.So, we are doing something a little easier for our honeymoon and we are staying in a condo on the coast of Oregon.By creating this giving account for our honeymoon, we are hoping you will partner with us by helping us take yet another adevnture together.We are so thankful we are surrounded by such wonderful people and to know in some way you can contribute to the beginning of this marriage means the absolute world to us. We thank you DEEPLY in advance for anything you may decide to give. All our love,Logan & Mikayla

TULSA, OK                                





                        Hello, I am Joshua Proper. This page is intended for family and friends to be able to send wedding gifts in the form of money if they would like to. The reason we are doing this, is because we met in the Philippine's while I was here working for a year and are getting married and moving to the U.S. when my contract is up in November. With that being said, the traditional wedding gift option would only end up costing us more money as we are already trying to condense what we bring with us to reduce cost of flying/shipping.Also the cost of doing the Visa, travelling to the U.S., as well as getting married and starting our new lives there from scratch (new jobs, new place to live, furniture, car, etc) means that cash is the best gift we can receive materially. We are also wanting to bring our Dog - Romeo with us, which will be costly as well.Another reason for us doing this, is that some of our closest friends live in multiple countries, not just our families. Sending things by USPS mail can take 30-60 days, not to mention potentially getting lost. This is the best way for everyone to be able to send money as a wedding gift - if they want to.We are looking forward to starting our new lives together and to all those back home - will visit as soon as we can after we get settled in. I will be heading to the U.S. in November to start getting things ready and start a new job, so we would like to have all donations in the next month roughly so we can plan easier.For family - if you are unable to send via GOFundme, you can contact Jess or Jenn and they have agreed to send for you. Please do not worry or stress if you can only send $5.00 or $10.00 any and all gifts will be appreciated and used for our resettling. We will be happy with any amount we get as it reduces our stress little by little, and it is certainly money we didn't have.If you have any questions please contact Dess or myself via facebook for now. Thank you all for your love and support and friendship!

PORTLAND, OR                                




Running Away to Hawai'i to Get MARRIED!!!(Help us bring our loved ones)As many of you know, we, Stephanie and I, Christian, have decided to take the plunge together. We are so excited to be starting our lives together as one from here on out. Our Story:(Stephanie & Christian @ Burning Man 2011)It all started back in 2011 at an arts festival where wemet. Growing a friendship that neither of us had any clue as to the foundation we were building.On April 1st 2014, we met upin Hawaii and the love began that instant. We couldn't get enough of each other or the world now that we were together. From Hawaii we moved to Southern California.(Shock and awe in The Narrows after proposal)Exactly one year later on April 1st 2015 we hikedup The Narrows in Zion National Park in waist deep river for hours and hours until we found the perfect rock to prop up on for me to surprise her with a proposal. SHE SAID YES!!!Ayear of bonding and adventures to the highest degreein LA and across the SW, with camping, festivals, rock hounding, hikes and hot springs, we decided to solidify our relationship by tying the proverbial knot. Our Plan:(Our First photo together in Hawaii)Since our love story began in Hawaii on April 1st, we have decided to get married on April 1st. That date has been special to us as individualsand to be able to share April Fools days as our anniversary is a dream come true. We expect many pranks during our anniversaries to come. ;-)We also realized that the best place to unite ourselves would be where our love began, the Big Island of Hawaii. We can't think of a more magical place in the world to do this. With us getting married in Hawaii, it also doubles as our honeymoon.What a better way to seal the deal than doing a renegade wedding on the beachwith one of our dear friends as minister and our closest friends and family there to share in the celebration. Our Goal:While we can make the basics of this trip happen for ourselves, we desire more than anything to have a few key members of our family and friends there to share it with us.There has been a lot of transition in all of our lives with the most recent one being that I (Christian) lost my job on NYE. Only 3 months before our big day. As tough as this is, we are taking it with chins held high and see it as just another opportunity to grow and learn. The timing couldn't have come at a more challenging time. Bring it on!!! We love a good challenge. We have 2 dear people in our lives that we want to make sure they can share this moment with us. 1. Round Trip Flight for 1 - $6502. Housing for 2 for a week - $5003. Food and incidentals for 2 - $150Total = $1300Stephanie and I decided that instead of registering for wedding gifts or a honeymoonfor ourselves, we want nothing more than to be able to do this thing together, with our closest friends and family. We can think of no greater gift than beingable to sharethese moments with those we love.And that includes you. We appreciate any help you can offer and would also love it if you, our friends & family, were able to join us for this awesome occation. Please contact us about travel details if you are able to join us.How To Help:So if you have any ability to help make this dream come truein any way, it would really make us the happiest newly weds to have ever newly wed. (say that ten times fast)Our wedding date is coming up fast so spread the word far and wide. We only have a few months until its go time. Good thing Steph and I like to be spontaneous. =)Our Future:If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goals, Stephanie and I will put it towards our Portland reception party after hawaii (TBA).We love you all and are so appreciativeto have each and every one of you in our lives.

Hey everyone!

So as you know, Cynthia Leedy and I (Gene Tolentino)will be getting married on September 17th in Cali! (YAY!) We are also planning to have a wedding party sometime in October here in Florida with family and good friends! We are both very excited for these events!

However, after doing some calculations, we realized, we can't do this alone.

So we decided to reach out to loved ones and friends for some assistance.We have been together for years and we really want to be able to celebrate our wedding with all our friends and family, but financially, it's really going to be tough for us, and it is going to be an obstacle.We are hoping that our good friends and family from afar and nearby can help us make the dream of our wedding and celebrating together come closer to reality.September and October aren't very far away and we need whatever help we can get to secure a wedding venue or any place we can have the celebration and to also pay for all the other expenses involved with the wedding and the wedding celebration. All of the funds will One Hundred percent be used for wedding and wedding celebration.

We know that times are hard on everyone right now. Trust me, I know andwe understand. However, if you could please help us live this happy moment, we would be extremely grateful for the rest of our happily married lives together. If we could do this by ourselves, we would. But the reality is, we need help. 

Thank you guys for anything you can donate, and whether or not we reach our goal, we will be married and live happily ever after. :)

Gene and Cynthia(soon to be) Tolentino.

I am going to start off as to why I am on Go Fund Me. Our wedding date is 01June2016 and we are so excited to start our lives together! If you were not invited do not feel bad! My mother was the only person I invited from my side, We just wanted something small and did not want this all eyes on us moment! We have been asked where to send wedding gifts or what wedding gift we would want. While thinking about this I was given the idea of making a GoFund Me by a co-worker. It was a great idea! Why is this a great idea? I will explain! So Au and I meet 27Feb2015, she was in the states on a work visa, she is not a US Citizen but will be soon! She is from Thailand and been in the states just a few years. I could not be luckier to have met her! Check out her or my Facebook anytime to see all the fun we have! So the reason Go Fund Me was a great idea is do to her status (work visa). After marriage We have to file several forms, go through biometrics, and even go through interviews with immigration about our marriage, and if that sounds fun! I will add more fun, just to start this process we are looking at about $1400 on several forms required. Just an example of the one of them, I-130 Petition of U.S. Spouse for Alien Spouse is $355.00 alone and that's not even close to the most expensive one! So for the honeymoon! We are planning on Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. Both of us have never been but have heard great things. Also nothing better than the beach in the summer!Any gift, donation, or even just a happy post is greatly appreciated!Don't forget to share this on Facebook and Twitter! Thank you, everyone!

                        Angel and I are getting married on August 20th. We have had plenty of help so far but we are still struggling with it financially. I have an envelope in which I've been keeping our tuxedo rental money that has to be paid this , only to discover today that someone had stolen $60 out of it. We already have another $1000 or two to try and come up with, and I was denied my credit card application today. So I'd really just like to come up with the money that was stolen so we can at least get that taken care of. Thanks all for reading.

Help Moon Get To America,$370 ,"$2,000 ",Newlyweds," August 11, 2016",8,1,BOWIE,TX,147000,,2,2,"






                            Lane Scruggs
                            
                            
                                                           
BOWIE, TX                                





                        In the summer of 2013, I traveled across the world to a city called Xichang, located in the Sichuan Province of China. During that trip, I would meet several great people who would have a significant impact on my life, but none greater than a young man by the name of Moon Mok.Moon was a high school student at the time, and the group that I was traveling with helped students at his school improve upon their English as a second language skills. We quickly became friends, and during my few weeks in his city we were able develop our brand new relationship through conversations concerning our countries, interests, and most importantly, our beliefs.He had several questions concerning what I believed in regards to the Christian faith, and by the end of the trip, had decided to join that faith himself by accepting Jesus Christ as his savior. Since then, we have been communicating as much as possible through several different means. We've continued on in conversations that I'll cherish forever; conversations of life struggles, hard questions of faith, and how to deal with problematic relationships. Through those conversations,it's easy to see that Moon has become a devout Christian with a great heart, and has grown to be someone that I look up to and enjoy talking to even to this day.Immediately following my enagement to the love of my life (Jolie Hartmann) on July 30th, Moon couldn't have been more happy for me. He began bombarding me with congratulations and questions about the big day, and expressed his desire to come to the United States to witness our wedding. He instantly started searching for flights over here, despite the fact that we have yet to even set a date!The bottom line is this:I want Moon to attend mine and Jolie's wedding.Not only that, but if it's possible, I want him to be a groomsman on my big day. It would mean the world to me if he could make it here and witness me marrying the most incredible girl in the world. He's already told me several times that he wants to help me on this day in any way he can. His excitement can not be overstated.In fact:Moon has never been to the United States.He's always had dreams to study abroad, but his financial situation wouldn't permit it. Despite that, he is already prepared to start saving up to $5,000 just to make it here for our wedding, and is planning to do so with only a part time job.That's incredible,especially considering that he's also currently attending a University in Shanghai.So, I am asking for your help. Moon does not yet know that I'm doing this, and I would like to keep it that way. I would like to raise enough money to cover his flight to and from the United States. With all my family and friends scattered throughout the area, we will no doubt be able to house and feed him while he's here, but the airfare is costly. With the amount of excitement and dedication that he has to witness a Christian marriage between his good friend and his lovely fianc (who hehas yet to meet), I think that he deserves some help.What do you say? Would you help Moon out? I would be forever greatful, and you would be helping a young man fulfill his dream of finally visiting the United States and reuniting with one of his best friends who lives on the opposite side of the globe. It's a daunting task, but I believe that with enough people contributing, we can make it happen.(Also, I'd love you to the Moon and back)

                        We would like to invite everyone to an all-expenses-paid wedding on the International Space Station, but that's more than we can afford just yet.Instead, we want to be married at the Renaissance Faire in costume surrounded by friends and family. Even a scaled down wedding is more than we can afford for a few years, but we've waited long enough already. We're tying the knot and we could use some help making our wedding wishes come true!In leiu of gifts, we're setting up a GoFundMe account for the wedding. We have everything we need for day-to-day living already. Should we surpass our goal, any extra will be used to help pay for our honey-moon in the Spring of 2016.

                        Howdy ya'll!We are super excited to be getting married and moving into the next phase of our amazing relationship! We are also grateful to include your love and support in this process. So here is the deal:We recently found out that our current home is being assumed into a large commercial development at the end of this year. And as Austin becomes more attractive to many people for many reasons, its becoming a tough place to buy property, especially for creatives. While most homes stay empty during the work day, the situation is quite different at our pad.Along with housing us, our 2 dogs, and constant visitors, we use the garage as an art/fabricationstudio, and the apartment above as a co-working space including Sarahs graphic design business, 2 artists, a landscape architect, and another designer.We do our best to maximize space and effort, so as we look for our next place, we have high hopes of bringing our community with us.We already have an amazing life together filled with lots of lovelyness, i.e. pots, pans, linens, dogs, art stuff, modes of transport...For this reason, we are asking for your financial support to help us make a downpayment on a house. In the interim, we will continue to share our abundance with as many people as we can via our open-door style. We are super grateful for your support in whatever form that takes and want you to know that we are always sharing what we receive. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to share them with us. We thank you, love you, and pray for your well being. Be well and we'll see you in September!!!Love,Sarah and Nick

MENA, AR                                




October 8, 2016 is our wedding date. To visit our wedding website please click this link:Mengjia and IsaacWedDue to the nature of our lives and the reality of living and working in Jerusalem, Israel, what some might consider as a more ""traditional"" wedding gift would be too difficult to transport and manage. Intercontinental travel is expensive and Mengjia will be moving from China to Israel as soon we are married. So, if you wish to bless us with a gift we would truly appreciate one of a monetary kind provided through this website. No amount is too small and you will be directly helping us in fulfilling our dream of pursuing what we believe is God's calling for our lives. Thank you.Love,Mengjia and Isaac More about us...My name is Isaac Gwin. Originally from the United States, I am currently working as a humanitarian features producer in Jerusalem, Israel. My job is to put together stories about individuals and families that have been helped through our humanitarian organization within Israel and other countries throughout the Middle East.Mengjia Li is my best friend and the love of my life. We recently got engaged and are looking to have her move to Israel from her current home in Beijing, China, to be with me as soon as we have our wedding in Arkansas on October 8, 2016.A Brief History of UsWell always have Dublin[Disclaimer: Isaac's account of things]Our story begins in the idyllic (and rather green if you can imagine) country of Ireland. We were both living in Dublin and doing internships for the summer with Mengjia crunching numbers at an accounting firm and yours truly working the beat for a local newspaper.We lived in the same apartment complex and had mutual friends, but hadnt had the pleasure of meeting each other yet. That was until said mutual friends decided to go for Chinese takeout. I went along knowing full well to expect the same variety of foodstuffs found at most every given takeout joint I was accustomed to munching at back in the States: crab rangoon, chow mein, General Tsos chicken (love that stuff!).When we got there I wasnt disappointed, but Mengjia had a very different take on things. I noticed she seemed rather perplexed as her eyes danced over the tiny, plastic menu grasped firmly in both hands. She looked up and said, Im Chinese, but I have no idea what any of this stuff is. Being the stinker that I know I am, I jokingly replied, What are you talking about? This is your people, your food! How could you not know what all this is? Well, by the scathing look she darted my way youd think I had insulted her and all 1.3+ billion of her countrymen by spouting such blasphemy. I will have you know that this is NOT real Chinese food, she roared with a stare of death. In fact, Im going to find a REAL Chinese restaurant with REAL Chinese food and Im going to take you there! As the smoke cleared and my senses returned to me, I slowly backed away and quietly went about my business.I received a text message two days later that read, I found a REAL Chinese restaurant. Youre coming with me tonight.  Mengjia.Guess what? I went! And that was our genesis. We had some truly amazing adventures in Ireland during that summer of 2012 and became fast friends. We stayed close even after we went back to the States  me to finish my journalism degree at the University of Kansas and Mengjia to complete a degree in accounting at Ohio State. Even after I got my first big-boy job and moved to Virginia Beach, Mengjia and I were in constant contact.Eventually we started dating, mostly long distance. Soon the time came when she would have to return to China and I was presented with the opportunity to pursue my dream of working as a humanitarian features producer in the Middle East with a move to Jerusalem. The vast expanse between us hasnt made things easy by any means, but we knew something very special awaited the two of us if we could just hold on to that dream of being together.So, on February 6, 2016, I proposed to my best friend and the love of my life on the Great Wall of China. I love her, I love her family and I want to share everything, all that I am, with her for the rest of my life under Gods blessing.And we are both so grateful that YOU are here to share in that journey with us.

An International Love Story,"$1,510 ","$3,500 ",Newlyweds," June 2, 2016",30,3,LAKE IN THE HILLS,IL,142000,,1,1,"






                            Kim Crum Klein
                            
                                                            on behalf of Karlyn Klein

LAKE IN THE HILLS, IL                                




Karly and Cj met in a most unlikely--and yet thoroughly modern--way. Cj was visiting Chicago during a record-setting cold snap in January 2015, when he decided to add his profile to Tinder out of curiosity. At that very same time, Karly coincidentally decided to check out the app that so many people were talking about just to see what it was all about. They both swiped right for the first time ever, and suddenly found themselves in a conversation with one another. After some initial dialogue via the Tinder app, they began changing actual text messages, and soon decided to meet in person. And that's where this love story begins.Cj is a British musician with a deep, abiding love for football (that's soccer for you Americans), and Karly is an artist with a deep, abiding love for music, tea, and animals. The two of them discovered kindred spirits in one another, and became inseparable during the very short time that Cj was in America. Unfortunately, he was only in Chicago for a visit and soon had to return to England. Thanks to modern technology, Karly and Cj were able to continue their blossoming relationship through FaceTime and Snapchat and WhatsApp and email, and both of them soon realized that what they wanted most of all was to spend more time together.Cj flew back to Chicago several months after their first meeting, and Karly traveled to London a few months after that. As time wore on, they both became sure of their conviction that they were meant to be together. The only thing standing in their way was the 3,945 miles between Chicago and London and the funds needed to shrink those miles. They decided to try to move continents, oceans, and mountains so that they could start a life together, and they began planning a wedding.Karly and Cj plan to be married quietly and privately in October in a quaint inn in the English countryside, and then to return to the United States to start their lives together.As as it turns out, whether you are an American or an Englishman, marrying someone from another country is quite complicated and filled with more paperwork and travel and visas and licenses than you can imagine. And all of this is costly for young people who are just starting off in life. They are both working hard to save enough money to make the wedding happen, but there is only so much money that they can put aside after paying their regular living expenses.I am Karly's mother, and I have started this campaign to help raise money to offset the travel costs necessary to bring these two wonderful people together. Neither one of them has asked for help from anyone else...I am making this request on their behalf. Karly must make two separate trips to England for the marriage license and the wedding itself, and then Cj needs to make a trip to his new home in Chicago after they are married. All the funds donated to this campaign will be used to help pay for their plane tickets and travel expenses, as well as some of the application fees involved with the licenses and visas and the wedding itself. They would be grateful beyond measure for your help in getting them to the same continent, so that their love story can continue on to its happily ever after.

                             Amanda and I met a few years ago, funny enough through an online dating site! A little shy and timid at first, but our friendship bloomed into a beautiful relationship; filled with respect, growth, encouragement, and most of all, love! We have been inseparable ever since we met and we're glad to announce that we're getting married September 10, my Fiancs Grandparents Wedding Anniversary.       As we both work long hours, we rarely get to spend time with each other and at times, it can be rough and stressful. Our mission is exactly that, a honeymoon where we can enjoy each others time and company, as well as celebrate our lasting bond to one another.        Amanda and I already live together, so we've accumulated all the household items we need. What we would like is a vacation! Some time just to ourselves. We have decided to go to Las Vegas! We know, thats where everyone goes to get married, but we've enjoyed our time there in the past and wish to explore more of what the city has to offer as a couple. We'd love to be able to see a show like Beatles Love, Blue Man Group, KA; just to name a few. Even go to the Historic Freemont Street and enjoy an evening on the town.       Amanda works for a spa, but is too busy to take part in the benefits. Id love for her to have a full spa day. She deserves to be pampered as she pampers everyone on a daily basis. Im a chef and would like to be able to try some new cuisines out, maybe Wolfgang Puck or Alize.      So many adventures and not enough time! We are truly blessed to be able to start this new adventure and with your help, it'll go off without a hitch. Just kidding  Of course we're getting hitched! Thank you in advance for helping start and create a lasting memory on our journey! Please help spread the word!

The resort is already booked and paid. Passports paid. She went to get her nest egg that they have saved of $1600 to find it gone, from her home. Nothing else touched or taken. The most heartbreaking about it is it must've been someone they know and trust. My daughter said to me ""Mom, the only thing I can do is think that whoever took it needed it more than us"". Well, its still sucks and honestly, impossible for them to save up that amount they had worked so hard to stash for this incredible week.They both work hard. Full time jobs, and have planned this for a year. I had an outpour of those who have asked to help. This is your opperturnity, and PLEASE no one under any obligation whatsoever.Please please know, that although this is a HORRIBLE and sad story, I understand there is much worse out there. Those that need much more than even money. But, that being said, I'm giving my loving friends the opporturnity here to donate to their honeymoon (they have already streatched it out until November). If you can, if you want, thank you from the bottom of my heart. If not, please know, that is totally fine.Love you all so much. I believe in good. Tami

                        Hi everyone! First, I just want to say thank you for taking the time to even visit our GoFundMe page. Stephen is an Army Vet, having served overseas. I, Tiffany, am still trying to persue my college degree after many set backs from being sick so much and having so many surgeries. We have 2 babies (puppies), work for the same company, a very supportive family, and are completely in love with our life! Our story was a very unexpected one but we couldn't be happier with it!Seven years after having met and after I moved down to Gulf Shores, we randomly started talking. He invited me up to surprise his mom and sister for a visit, as I was always closer with them than him. I went with the known intention of seeing his family, but was truly more excited to go see him. I was so nervous! I'd seen him a million times, but I had crazy butterflies because I had developed a ""crush"" on him. Little did I know, he had actually invited me to come with same intentions as me. After always saying we would never date each other, we started dating that weekend. Things developed with us pretty quickly and love came even quicker. We knew a long distance relationship wasn't going to work for us for very long. He made the decision to move down to Gulf Shores so we could really be together. On a random Mon. at work he told me to come home and change after I got off work, that he was taking me out. I got home and he was not yet home so I was stubborn, of course, and decided not to shower and get dressed to go out. It was a Mon. after all. What could we possibly do on a Mon.?He came home and made me climb in the car with him, not knowing where we were going or what we were doing. He took me to eat at the most romantic restaurant, which was a huge treat, and we went to walk on the beach after. We were sitting there for awhile, just talking, and then completely out of nowhere, he asked me to be his wife.So now we are getting married on April 23!We have been so crazy planning for the wedding that we didn't even really think about a honeymoon until recently. We decided to go to New Orleans because of the history and background of the city. We want to go visit the WWII Museum, take tours of the city, visit a plantation, etc.; just exploring the city and learning about it's traditions and history (no partying on Bourbon St. - we couldn't care less about that). We both love that type of thing and New Orleans is perfect for it!Between starting new jobs, sick puppies, doctors, car problems/repairs, and of course the wedding, we have had to use all of our funds. We have not been able to save up the first penny for our honeymoon. We have already booked our room and are so very excited; we truly need this time together, just the 2 of us. We will be so disappointed if we have to cancel.This would make a perfect wedding gift if you wanted to get us something but couldn't make it to the wedding or shower. It means a lot to us that you would even take time out to read this and/or consider it. If you can't donate we completely understand. We don't even really expect to meet our goal but any donation made would mean the world to us, more than you could possibly know! We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any donations and, like I said, even taking the time to read this.We love you all!! <3*Donations should be made by April 20 please.PS: Please feel free to share this :)

 SO! This fund raiser is for a SUPRISE trip for my new Husband, Michael (in white above) Shhhhh!Michael is the man of my dreams and I want to do something truly epic for him. I need your help to do this. The photo abovecaptures everything I love about US in one snap. Our Story: Those of you who know me, know that I am driven, fun and have always wanted someone to love and to cherish and to share all of my great adventures with. That being said, when I met Michael, I was more than a little jaded frommy previous encounters with New York's variety of crazy suitors. Five years of single life had taught me to be more than a little leary of someone's advances. Enter: Michael. Military man, handsome, charming, well spoken, patient and... PERSISTANT.  He was working two blocks from my apartment when we met, and my first thoughts after he approached me were something around the lines of, ""A hot, Marine wants to 'just' get to know me... Riiiight."" I couldn't have been more mistaken.  He courted me for two months, took me on dates, got to know me for who I am, and took the time to actually invest in US as a pair, as a team. Team. A concept that eluded me in all past relationships, in my childhood and in my growing up. This man taught me that two truly is better than one, and finally... after what seemed like an eternity, he asked me to be his boyfriend. I happily accepted, and we spent the next three months in a long distance relationship that made us grow exponentially closer because all we had was facetime, texts and the phone to grow closer together. We rose to the challenge, and six months later I was back in NYC and moved in. The rest of our journey was blizz, happiness, family, and love; all wrapped around my love and devotion to this incredible man. Then, thisApril, after months of bliss, trials, speedbumps, love, and incredible journeys together, Michael took me to Prospect Park on a suprise date and took my breath awaywhen heProposed to me on bended knee in the centre of Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Park. He took me to dinner that night at a restaurant named James, and the following monday, we were granted our Civil Union. I love this man with my everything and I want to show him a trip that will be forever in his memory.HERES WHERE I NEED HELP!Michael has visibly changed my life.I want to show Michael an incredible adventure to thank him for the unconditional love an support he has given to me over the last two years of our lives together. As explorers, we both wanted to see Mexico and to explore the Great Barrier reef that lies along the Yucatan. As a gift, my family has donated a time share for us to stay at while were there, and I have saved up some money for the expendatures, but I still need some assistance. Any help will go directly toward giving him and us a memory to commemorate an even that we were NOT even privy to until just a few years ago. I would give Michael the world if I could, but for now, I want your help in giving him memories of the ocean, and serenity... of paradise. I want him to be completely removed from his 65 hour work weeks, and from the pressures and hubbub of New York for just a few days. And YOU will be there for the entire journey!I plan to document the entire trip, facebook live, and photo bomb at every chance I can get. I will also personally thank each and every one of you for helping me with this suprise! Help me to Suprise the LOVE of my LIFE! Sending much Love to everyone who reads this, and hoping all your dreams come true!~James~

PHOENIX, AZ                                




One of my best friends for best part of 10 years, Kasey is battling terrifying circumstances, his 20 month old daughter is missing. He is loved by all, makes us laugh. He is nothing less than a strong provider, dedicated to family, friends MOST OF ALL ,Beautiful lil Ms Mila, a daddy's girl thru and thru Mila, 20 months old, and has disappeared, missing for nearly two months. Believed to be with her mother, by . AZ law parental-custodial interference!! Its a father's worst nightmare. I, as, so many other friends have sat trying to console..my sweet friend.. It just breaks down all our spirits. Kasey will not speak badly of Mila's mother. Whom the toddler was last seen with moving their shared home items into a moving truck. Not a call, a forwarding address, etc. Mother and Child are believed to be on east coast possibly New Jersey. AZ law requires minimum 45 day written notice before removing child from AZ. I'm in desperate hope his friends all come forward, and try to see if there is anything else we can do, he's done everything, exhausted all means to locate Mila. Time to find an aggressive family attorney, private detective!! He has attempted service thru family, friends in common, expensive countless internet searches, private investigator's. Mail by certification. Due to baby girl's disappearance in such extremes that nobody seems to know mother or daughter's whereabouts, friends of Kasey, and undoubtedly Kasey fears the worst. WHERE IS MILA?? She will be 2 November shown in photos. Every parent deserves to know their babies are safe at night. Kasey has done something to help us all at one point, he will/has always helped those close to him. I'm grateful and honored to call this Man my friend. He needs us all more than ever.A Family Court lawyer can run over 30k ,depending. Please shoot him a text, uplifting his spirits and donate what you can, so we can bring Mila home safely and QUICKLY. MUCH LUV

                        It is finally that time! I am ready to marry my 'swolemate'! Hi, my name is Zach and my fiance is Abby. We've dated for the past two years and I can honestly say that I am ready to marry the girl of my dreams. We've had our ups and downs but have always come out of it stronger. We have had our occasional arguments but they're always resolved before going to bed. She's the best thing that has ever happened to me.  I feel like everyday that I am with her, I am becoming a better man. She holds me to the highest of standards, challenges me to be the best I can be, and helps me stay focused on my goals. She even got me back in church and back in touch with the Lord. I find myself praying everyday even if its just about the small things in life. We have become quite an amazing team. Without her, I would not be the man I am today.  We're both about to graduate college within the next year and already have our next few years planned out for us by our jobs. Our future is looking great. As of now though,we're beginning the hunt for where to live and so there will be a few moving pains as well asa need for the essentials like pots, pans, towels, etc.I really didn't expect to use this site but decided why not? It couldn't hurt.  Thank you in advance for any contributuin you're willing to give. I know it will help us in our future endevors and make for a memorable wedding!

                        Hey everyone! So, Tashia and I are getting married! We are very excited about our upcoming day on June 19th, 2016! We talked at length about what we want to do for our wedding when it came to gifts, and honestly, all we could think of was how much we would rather be able to afford a honeymoon out of the country.  If you are uncomfortable doing a cash gift we are registered at IKEA and Target for things we do need. REMEMBER: Your presence is more important than a gift though :)It is hard for us to reach out like this, but in all honesty, we wouldnt be able to afford it on our own. We both come from modest families and are paying for the wedding all on our own.So, we hope that those of you going, and not but wanting to contibute, can consider donating as much as you want towards our honeymoon. From 1 penny to 2 pennies, anything is appreciated! But seriously, we love you all and look forward to those coming to be with us on our big day. Those of you who can't make it, or are supporting our new journey. Thank you for being a part of our day, if even in spirit. Regardless, your presence at our wedding is the most important thing. So, this is all optional!DONATE HERE!:  https://www.gofundme.com/tashcamLove,Cameron and Tashia

 As a highschool freshman on the way to class, I turned my head briefly to the right and immediately fell in love with a captivating individual. Fast forward eleven years later and here we are on the verge of our wedding. Sean and I have spent the last year building funds out of nothing to pay for our wedding. We're off to Colorado to marry amongst the sunset casted clouds in a hot air balloon. It hasn't been easy making our fairy tale plausible, but we're hoping with a little help from our friends, we can make our dream adventure come true.  Plenty of our friends and family members have been asking where we're registered and what they'd like for them to do for us. Well, here it is! As it seems, we don't need new material additions to our home, for we feel secure in our possessions. We are asking if our dear friends and precious family members would like to partake in making our honeymoon just a little bit more awesome. You see, Sean and I want spend our honeymoon doing what we love most- roadtripping. We want to visit some major sights as we make our way home from Colorado. With your monetary nuptial blessing, we feel the journey home will be laced with the warm hearts that want to make our union as special as possible. Thank you for your time and consideration! Our wedding date is September 4th, 2016. Sean and I appreciate any gifts recieved by then. *Any donation exceeding $50 will procure a small trinket from our trip picked out specially for you<3*Any donation less than $50 will guarantee you a smooch and hug from choice individual

                        Hello and thanks for stopping by our campaign! If you have already received your invitation and visited our wedding website, than you know what this campaign is for.Like we mentioned on our website, gifts are most certainly NOT a necessity. However, anyone who wishes to gift us something to celebrate our union, this is the place to do it.Sara has decided that she wants to go to North Carolina for our honeymoon, stating that she wants to see the mountains and hopefully the autumn leaves. I then suggested Asheville. One of the ( very few, lol ) benefits of marrying an over the road trucker is that I know some of the best places too visit in the country. I've driven through Asheville and was struck at how picturesque the place seemed, and when Sara looked it up online, she was sold.So that's our goal, to have a honeymoon filled with romance, fun, and memories to last us a lifetime.We both look forward to sharing our special day with all of you. We can't wait to see you there!

                        Hi friends & family. After 2 years of a long distance relationship Ethan & I finally have tied the knot and got married!! We are so excited to start our lives together however since our marriage isnt the traditional kind, we are now in the process of getting Ethans green card/living in the same country! With this process comes a lot of fees, adjustment of status $1,995, homeland security fees 1,490 and a medical exam of $300 +. Plus possible hidden fees. We aren't expecting to get anywhere near our goal, but anything would help and we would be ever so greatful. We are also extemely thankful for all the love and support we have already received from so many of you! Thank you again!

                        Hello there, Thank you for reading. Your support really means a lot to us. We met almost 5 years ago. The first collegefootball game of that upcomingseason was the first timewe called each other ""Boyfriend"" and ""Girlfriend"".  Three years after that, on the weekend before our anniversary, Whitney arranged for a Groupon wine tasting tour in Tamecula, CA. He told Morgan all about it. What he didn't mention was that he had secretly planned a sunrise hot air balloon ride, where he planned to propose.  Morgansaid, ""Yes!""We would like your help to get to Europe for our honeymoon. Were going to Spain and Germany in October to experience their festivals. Every little bit helps. Our airfare, AirBnB, and adventures total around $5,000. It's a 21-hour flight to Europe and 25-hour flight home, with a layover in Moscow. We would like to make ourtrip as memorableas possible. Please consider helping us reach our Honeymoon goal.  Think of your supportas our wedding gift. Thank you all very much, Whitney Redfield & Morgan Evans

                        There are just over 30 days until Tramaine and I tie the knot. We have decided to pay for the wedding ourselves, but between the wedding festivities and me moving to Arizona, we are requesting help from our friends and family for an amazing honeymoon.In lieu of gifts we are asking an average of 10 people a day to give $10/day towards a fund for our honeymoon. If we can meet this goal we would be able to take a trip of a lifetime to Jamaica. Anything willhelp so please consider contributing even if it's just a small amount.We understand that marriages go beyond the wedding and even beyond the honeymoon, we are excited to begin this amazing relationship built up the right way. At a time when both of us least expected, God put us right where we needed to be to find each other.We cannot wait to spend the rest of our lives together and are very excited to share these beginning memories with you all. We are extremely thankful we have you all as a great support group to lean on and remind us of what is important in a marriage. We have had many people tell us it is the friendship and just the other day we met a man on a plane who has been married 48 years and told us that, ""it is all about not only learning how to get along but also learning to not get along because it will happen, and no matter what you both have to have that stake in the ground and say 'we're not going anywhere'"". God has blessed us both very much in our lives throughbasketball and the people he has placed in front of us and we hope and pray that we will be able to continue to represent him and make an impact wherever we end up in life...together. Thank you again.

THOMASVILLE, GA                                





                        Greetings our Dear Friends and Family -  Karla and I - are a dream couple come true!  We meet two years ago in Thomasville, GA.  Here's how it all started... I went into a business thats a customer of mine and there she was working behind the counter.  All I saw in my vision was this very beautiful lady wearing a white sun dress, extremely attractive and smiling cheek to cheek. The first words out of her mouth were - Welcome to Sweet Basils. My thoughts at that very moment were...  yessss...... ""Welcome to Sweet Basils"" hehehe The key to a great salesman is to never give up and I wasn't about to let this beautiful lady out of my life!  As I learned more of Karla... I was soon to discover she had values just like mine and the best part was... she was part of a great and loving Christian family.  It was very hard at first for her to open up to me and hand me over her phone number. The salesman that I am... I knew I could make this deal happen!  Fast forward to 2015 - Karla's Birthday and and yes that's the day it happened! The first place where we had our first date was the place I asked her to marry me! Our Background -  We both moved to Thomasville the same year.  Early 2000 I took a career here in this beautiful city and Karla moved up to Thomasville from Florida with her parents.  Karla works at a Health Food Store and I work for Mediacom Communications Corp. My background is in Television Broadcasting and the Cable Industry and Karla's background is in Health and Natural Medicine. Be part of our celebration: After the day we say I do... We are still unsure as of what type of celebration we both would like to do and take. However, the time is quickly approaching! Our Wedding day is May 21st, 2016. My Birthday!  How neat right - I asked Karla to marry me on her Birthday and we our getting married on my Birthday. This is and will be the best Birthday Gift a man can ask for!!! We are still unsure as of what we would like to do for our celebration. We have tossed around a cruise, going to the mountains, and or the beach. God has blessed me throughout the years with the things that I need to make a house a home. Therefore, Karla and I are well taken care of in that area of need. If you feel lead to help us celebrate our celebration... please feel free to give to our celebration fund. Please also feel free to give us any ideas of how to use the love offering that you are blessing us with.  Any amount you give will be received with tons of love from the both of us. We love you and look forward to sharing our life story with you throughout the years to come.  Soon to be Mr. and Mrs. Karla and Julian Griffin

My Transgender Cousin's Wedding,$730 ,"$10,000 ",Newlyweds," July 12, 2016",12,2,LOS ANGELES,CA,118000,,2,2,"

                                                            on behalf of NANCILEE SANTOS

LOS ANGELES, CA                                





                        After much thought and consideration I have decided to start a gofundme for my beloved cusin whom is found herselfin a challenging life situation. This person is kind, hardworking, intelligent, courageous, and deserving. She has spent herentire adult life helping children who are developmentally disabled and has brought joy to many. Shehas maintained a burdensomesecret for many years. However she has finally found the courage to do what she has felt in herheart. She made the brave decision to transition last year. Yes, she is transgender. Right after hertransition, herlongtime and loving partner agreed to marry her. Last summer, they signed a contract at a hall for a rather modest wedding that they were sure that they would be able to afford. Unfortunately, being transgender in this world has many consequences. One consequence was that she was unmercifully harassed by his administrators, coworkers, students and was forced to leave herjob and to find a position which paid much less. She kept trying to keep up herpayments to the wedding hall. However due to hernew financial situation, she has found it impossible to do so. As a result, she will lose all the money she painstakingly invested in the wedding. For all those who know her, theirwedding was going to be the bright light at the end of a very dark tunnel she and herpartner have experienced for the last year. Herpartner's father was trying his best to help with the wedding expenses, but unexpectedly he just had emergency open heart surgery. Due to the physical nature of herpartner's father's job, his doctors will not permit him to return to work for several months. Therefore, he is now unable to help this couple out as he had planned and fully expected. Although, this couple is extremely relieved that his operation was a success, they fully understand that they need to find the money this caring father so wanted to give them. Herown parents have also tried to help them, but their funds are also very limited because herfather has been very ill for several years and can no longer work. Herparents, who Ihave known since Iwas born, have always been hardworking, generous, respectable, and loving parents now find themselves in a nightmarish position which they never could have predicted. Their beloved family home is now in foreclosure due to the fact that herfather's poor health and not being strong enough to work left them no option but to fall behind on their mortgage payments. Yet their main concern in life is that their transgender child, who has struggled all herlife, and herstrong and supportive partner can have a wedding. We are also praying that herfather's health improves so he can be present when his child marries.  In short, their families have unfortunately found themselves in the perfect storm and feel hopeless and helpless. We know perfectly well that there are many people who do not support the transgender community. However, if you knew this person, you would know she is so much more than just being transgender. She has always been there for everyone, especially the underdogs and anyone in need. She always pays it forward. Therefore, we are praying that there will be people who might be able to walk in hershoes, and contribute whatever they can despite their opinions of transgenders. Please remember this couple and their families have tried their best to salvage this wedding. We would like this wonderful and courageous couple, who have experienced so much harrassment and pain, to have their one day in the sun. We would sincerely appreciate no negative comments about transgenders. We know that everyone has the right to their own opinions. However, please express them on your posts. Thank you in advance!! God bless!Thank You,Chris Santos

                        Marc and I have been friends since we were just teenagers. When I was just 14 I found him on a social media site and took the chance to say hello. Throughout the years we talked and remained friends and joked about one day meeting and being together. It seemed like a distance dream that we would ever be able to actually meet and make it reality. We both went through our share of bad relationships and came across each other again at the end of 2015. Marc helped me from going back into a toxic relationship and made me realize my self worth again. From then we decided we needed to meet. We both saved up whatever money we could to make our dream a reality. Finally he travelled 8000+ miles to come meet me and make our dream come true. Things were everything I imagined they would be. But he had to return to Australia and now our lives have a missing piece since we aren't together. We are asking for help to apply for a fiance visa and a plane ticket for him to come back for good and we can live our dream of being together out.

                        Our names are LAShonda and Jordan.  We are getting married in August of 2015! We could not be more excited, terrified, or blessed to be starting this new journey together. Our story began a little less than 2 years ago after the 2 of us returned from a deployment with the Navy.  An invite to a casual spaghetti dinner led  us to pursue spending more and more time together.  Now we want to spend the rest of our lives together, forever.  All we want to do is make our wedding day special; which to us means being able to pay for the basics without going flat broke. We hope our day will be simple, yet elegant, with lots of love, laughter, and fun. In order to make that happen we are asking for your help by supporting us monetarily. Whether you can donate $1 or $100 it will mean the world to us!

                                                            on behalf of Adriane carrier

VENTURA, CA                                





                        DREAM HONEYMOON REGISTRY http://www.gofundme.com/adrianedeborahwedYes! Adriane & Deborah are getting Married Saturday, June 27, 2015, New York City in Central Park.Before we share a little about ""US"" we would like to share why we have selected this form of registry. We have decided to use the tools of Gofundme.com vs. the traditional registry because we are blessed to have a home fully furnished. Many of our friends and family have inquired about wedding gifts! We would like to let all of you know that our desire is to travel & enjoy the history of our roots in parts of Italy! Our intentions are to gain your support in having that happen comfortably. And we really would like to spare our loved ones from the purchases of the double coffee pot syndrome. We invite our friends and family to be part of that dream and what we are up to as a married couple! This is my story, I (Deborah) was standing in the kitchen of my friend Francines house on or around March 2011, and she asked me what was I declaring in my life within the year? I thought about it for a moment, and while contemplating the question she said, think the impossible. I responded I would be married this year, she chuckled and asked by when? I replied by November 2011. She said that was bold and we laughed By November 24, 2011, I was engaged to the love of my life-Adriane Carrier. She is the beautiful soul I've waited for my entire life. Our journey together is truly magical and we have been engaged for nearly 3.5 years and during this time I have discovered she is my teacher, student, friend, lover, confidant, role model, my accomplice, my true counterpart, ally in conflict, my greatest fan, toughest adversary, comrade in adventure, accomplice in mischief, smart, intelligent, witty, tenderhearted about life, her smile melts my heart, and my equal in all things, she is my True Love! Adriane: Many people go through life with the hopes of finding a true love and soul mate. The journey of love starts with the self. In 2011 I embarked on a life changing, soul-searching journey in Florida at the invitation of a dear friend, Josephine. The changes in my life that I created while immersed in my journey at Gratitude Trainings would change the course of my life and eventually where I met the love of my life, Deborah Maglio. By being open to seeing myself in a different light and being willing to be vulnerable and challenge myself, with the support of an amazing team of beautiful beings, I also met an amazing, beautiful woman, whom I desire to spend the rest of my life with and travel the world together. Life is an amazing journey and we are so blessed to have each other and its our dream to be married in Central Park, New York June 27th 2015 and share our love around the globe, starting with a journey to southern Italy and Sicily.What's left:     A Dream Honeymoon!!!! Thank you for supporting us!OUR 'REGISTRY' DREAM HONEYMOON is to travel to our roots in Italy and Sicily.

We also are planning on doing some home improvement (hence the request for gift cards if you would like to do so).

                        We are desperately trying to raise money for our wedding in November. We currently are relying on friends and family for free positions in the wedding, but would love a chance to feed our guests and maybe even rent a place for a reception. We both work making enough money to survive but nothing extra for wedding expenses, and I am currently in school with no financial aid. Anything would help us to have a beautiful wedding, which my lovely fianc deserves so much. Thank you from the bottom of both our hearts!

                        Hi everyone! First and foremost, thank you so much taking a minute of your day to check out our honeymoon fund.We are SO very excited to get married at our own home on Agust 13th, 2016 and celebrate with our wonderful family and friends! Why we started this honeymoond fundWe knew right away we didn't want a traditional wedding gift registry. We've been living under the same roof for two years now, and we are very fortunate to have everything we need! Instead, we wanted to ask our family and friends to donate to an experience.As many of you know, Amber and Ihave had different schedules over the last 2 years. Our weekends have been spent apart. It has been hard with traveling and constantly working as we both run our own businesses and manage to feed and love 4 teenage boys. It would mean the world to us to take a real vacation together and escape from our busy lives!Where we'll goOur plan is to take a 7 day fishing trip through our favorite parts of Montana and Wyoming. We both spent many years away from Montana before moving back to the place we love the most. Our most favorite thing to do is be out in nature, together. Some of our most favorite time have been out in nature and that's where we would love to celbrate our marriage.When we'll goWe are planning October of this year. This will give us a few months to get things back in order at home and work, get the boys back school and actually have the time to enjoy all the wonders of where we live....after the tourists have mostly left. ;)We hope to meet our goal of $3500 by September 1st, 2016 so we can book our stays.Many people have asked us what kind of toaster we want, or what bottle of liquor they can buy us. We would be SO thankful if you would consider donating to our honeymoon fund instead of buying us anything. We'llbe putting together postcards after the honeymoon and will send you all one.Thanks for reading and supporting The Phillips! We love you all.

Kelsey and Steve are getting Married!

Our wedding is on Saturday, October 8th and we don't want to do a registry. Our honeymoon will be to New York City on October 10th and we figured, if you wanted to get us something for our wedding, helping to offset the honeymoon cost was the best thing you could do.

Donate whatever you like and we will be eternally greatful, whether it be $1.00, $10.00, or $100.00! Or you can simply wish us well on our Facebooks and the whatnot!

We intend to see a show, see some standup comedy, act as lame tourists, and gain 10lbs.

Help Billy stay!! Immigration fees,$700 ,"$2,000 ",Newlyweds," July 15, 2016",8,2,COPIAGUE,NY,108000,,,,"

COPIAGUE, NY                                





                        Hello!My name is Rebecca DeJesus from Long Island, New York and one year ago I met the love of my life. His name is Billy Moore and he lives in England. We recently got married! June 28th 2016 to be exact, in a cute park in Rosyln with my family and our friends. When I met Billy I knew he would be the one I'd spend the rest of my life with. The way we could spent hours talking to eachother , even an ocean away, the way he could make me laugh like no one else. We knew we were meant to be, and it was a surprise to us how we could share this love for eachother, and the boarders of our countries would keep us apart. After learning when we got married, Billy would have to return to England, we were distraught. We discovered the process of getting a greencard for Billy was going to be difficult. While doing our research online we realized there was no way we could do it with out legal advice. We contacted a recomended immigration lawyer, and have got the process started. With his advice, Billy should stay in America during the process, leaving him not able to work. We intend to use ALL the wedding money we recieved as gifts, but we still come up short. 2000$ short. We need this to pay our lawyer by September 1st. We are very blessed to have my godmother Joan who recently had a kidney transplant, be our number one supporter who has and will do whatever she can to help us. At this time she can no longer give us any monitary assistance.  We are bestfriends, and now husband and wife, all we want is to live life together, like any other married couple. We desire the things most people take for granted: waking up together, having breakfast and sharing the day. We always have a departure date mocking us when we are together. Can you imagine having to leave your loved one due to these visa contrictions? With no idea where to turn, here we are, on Go Fund Me, asking for help from anyone who is able to. Thank you for reading our story.-Rebecca and Billy Moore.

Pencils and Pads for Girls ,"$2,200 ","$2,000 ",Newlyweds," July 21, 2015",23,14,PORTLAND,OR,108000,,,4,"






                            Jyothi Gaddam
                            
                            
                                                           
PORTLAND, OR                                




Why Pencils?On a recent trip to Ethiopia, when my car broke down, (more than once!), school kids would crowd around and typically ask me if I had a pencil! I was so struck, because kids where I came from usually ask for candy or money. All along the countryside, I could see evidence of the determination of kids to go to school in Ethiopia. Kids waking up before dawn and walking 2 hours or more to get to a school. Kids as young as 6 and as old as 16-18 years - all walk miles to school, every day.  I am going again to Ethiopia next Monday, July 27th and would love to carry any school supplies you would like to donate.Why Pads ? I also learnt that in Ethiopia, there are about 18 million school age girls. Most of them drop out of school when they hit puberty, because they do not have access to sanitary pads. Most use unhygienic ways to protect themselves and are restricted to the house, ending up getting married or having children early. Instead as in any country, if a girl stays in school, she is less likely to get married early or give birth before her body is even ready. This has a huge impact not only on her health and the health of the children she bears, but the health of the nation. Realising this need, the Mariam Seba Sanitary Products Factory in Ethiopia is producing low cost, environmentally friendly, washable and reusable sanitary pads called dignity pads.  A $100 will help 30 girls with protection that is good for a year! There is another great environmental reason for promoting reusable pads because one disposable sanitary napkin takes 300-500 years to disintegrate .Drop off your donation of school supplies or donation for sanitary pads between 10 and 12noon on Saturday July 25th at 4430 McCoy Village (corner of MLK and Prescott).

With that being said, we are asking for donations to go towards the wedding in lieu of gifts at the ceremony. No need to donate or bring a gift, but if you were planning on bringing a gift- we would rather it go to everyone having a good time at the ceremony instead of our bank account. Donated money will go towards food, booze, and fun activities! The more we raise the more fun it will be!Thanks in advance everyone! We hope to see you there!!

We are a hardworking young couple who put everyone else above anything. My love works in computers, I work as a deputy. We do the best we can always. We are excited to be getting married starting this beautiful journey together as one. We hope we get support and help with our honeymoon adventure. We are barely going to be able to scrape together money to have a fabulous time with our loved ones at our wedding. But we are trying to make it all happen to make beautiful memories. If you can please support us that would be wonderful. It's better to receive funds than to have to buy items. It's just our own personal belief. We won't have much time off together so we just want to have the little time we have together to make memories be the best without worry about expenses. After our wedding we would love to take a small road trip across some states, sight see, etc as we won't be able to afford a real honeymoon. So if you can help us make this happen we would forever appreciate it. Thank you and God bless

Since we both work in media we dont make money and we also know that all you beloved friends and family want to give us something to celebrate our love and partnership.Thats why we created this gofundme: there's some legal fees we have to pay in order to get married (if you need more information just ask us!) and if you can help us we will be grateful forever.So, everylittle amountyou can help us with will be used to make our love stronger and *legal*.We have about four or so months at least to get our paper stacked for this so dont feel stressed if you are low in cash now, you got time to contribute.Love y'all!Callie and Camilo

                        A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....Well not really, but it did all start with a mouse. Two lovers of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Disney, James Bond, and more found someone they love even more than those things. Even better someone to share their love of such things together! Gaines and Sarah came together because of their shared loves and now they are setting out on their greatest adventure together. On November 5th, 2016 they will say I do and agree to a lifetime of adventures together.To start this adventure they want to set sail on a Disney Cruise, but to do that they are going to need the help of a legion of stormtroopers and others!The chance to go out and cruise together under the familiar and beloved banner of Disney means so much to them. To have this chance would be a perfect cap to their wedding. Funds will be used to help make this wish come true onboard the Disney Dream and pay for a hotel for the nights before the cruise.Thank you for taking the time to look at helping us start our journey together. It means the world to us if you would help us do what we cannot on our own.

                        Adrian and I created this GoFundMe account in hopes to help with money for our dream wedding. Although we are both very young and know that marriage is hard, we know with God's help and guidance our marriage will flourish. With Adrian being in the Marine Corps and a full time college student, and myself recently an early grad and starting college in a couple of weeks while looking for a job, money is very tight right now and we do not want to start our lives together while being in debt at such a young age and so early on. In hopes to avoid that we ask for some type of donation, even one dollar will help, anything will be greatly appreciated, and we will be blessed to receive help. Thank you and God Bless.

                        We are getting MARRIED!  Sunday, July 24, 2016 on the beach in Ft. Walton Beach, FL. (No shoes required.) Many of our friends and family have asked where we are registered and want to get us a gift for our wedding. Because Jamie and I have lived by ourselves for the past few years, we each have all our own stuff and therefore, collectively we have two or three of everything. While everyones desire to get us something for the wedding is awesome (we really appreciate it) we just don't need anything. In fact, we are already planning the big yard sale when we finally move in together. If you still wish to give us a gift, we would be thrilled if you donated to our wedding fund. The goal is help cover some of the wedding cost and start our lives together as debt free as possible. We cannot thank you enough for your generosity. See you on the beach in July!

                        When you find someone who is just as wild, just as crazy and hopeful as you are...you stick with them.Luckily, I found two.My name is Robyn ""Mouse"" Johnson, and I am in a loving polyamorous relationship with two of the best men my little world has to offer.While Brian, the man I've been with for 4 1/2 years, is a dedicated life partner, Parlan and I have decided to tie the knot in a very long engagement.Giving a nod to Parlan's ethnic background, we have decided to follow the tradition of a Scottish handfasting.For those that don't know, in the olden days, handfastings were used a public declaration of intent to wed. It allowed couples to live with each other as a married unit until such a time when a priest could officially wed them.With a modern twist, we have decided to have the handfasting as our big celebration (think engagement party) in November of this year, and will be legally wed November of next.I have the support and love of my family and friends, and while I wish that was enough to pull this off...it's not. Both Parlan and I are currently unemployed due to various disabilities, which greatly limits what we are able to accomplish at this time.The costs of dress, venue, food, and honeymoon have stacked up, to the point where our plan of tying the literal knot has slowly turned into a pipe dream.We want this...badly. He is such a huge part of me and my heart, and Brian adores the man just as much as I do.While I have very little to offer in return, you will get a thank you letter from me for any donation, no matter how small. And of course, for those who wish to attend, an invite to festivities.We never thought we were the types to get hitched, and yet here we are, finding eachother and loving eachother and ready...so very ready...to start our lives as a wedded couple.

LOS ANGELES, CA                                




Hi! For those of you that know us, we met 2003 and have discovered how much we care for and love each other. In 2011 we registered domestic partners since marriage wasn't an option yet in CA. This past few years our relationship has grown stronger and we want to celebrate that bond by having it formally declared with a ceremony. However, the cost of arranging such a celebration is proving more than we were prepared for. Our desire is to hold it during the October 9-11th weekend in Palm Springs when many of our friends would already be there so it would not necessitate additional travel for them. And we want to include many of the wonderful people we've met over the years and have them join in this joyous event. So we would like to ask our friends and family to in lieu of a wedding gift that you offer a contribution to help offset the cost of the event and will allow us to include everyone that wants to join us for this special day! Our plan is to hold the ceremony on Saturday morning October 10th around 10am. Those of you who are going to be in the Palm Springs area that weekend be sure to let us know! Once we have the venue and other arrangements made we will notify everyone who wants to participate to mark this great event! We both thank you for your consideration!!!

                        Friends and family...If you have ever wondered if true love really existed I can tell you, yes..it does. Jeremy and I have lived through many tests before God granted us the gift of each others faithfulness, honesty and true love.Many of you have watched through the years as our love has grown through facebook or face to face. There is no doubt that we were made for each other. Jeremy has opened his heart so easily to my children, loving them more than I could ever ask for. Being there for them on a daily basis to help with all of their wants and needs. This is one of the many reasons I love him so very much!We are so excited to enter into our next chapter of life, through marriage. We cannot wait for May 29th to get here...to become Mrs. Carissa Johnson is to be one of the biggest highlights of my life! Jeremy and I are asking that since we have about every single thing we could ever ask for...that instead of a wrapped gift being given..whatever amount you would have spent on that gift, please donate it to us to help us pay for our honeymoon.Our desire is to be able to go to Turks and Caicos for our honeymoon. I personally have never been on a real vacation and am truely looking forward to an opportunity to enjoy this experience with my husband.Jeremy and I are paying for everything to do with our wedding ourselves. In September my boss retired and left me with no job. It has been a struggle for our family but we are making it through. It is now March and I have still not found a company to belong too. We have had to put all wedding plans on hold for the time being to keep focused on daily life. I know God will bless me with an amazing job opportunity soon. Any help that you as our friends and family can give will be humbly appreciated.We love each of you so wholeheartedly and cannot wait to share our joy with you on May 29, 2016!!!!

Nikosi and Juiliet's Dream Wedding,$95 ,"$10,000 ",Newlyweds," May 16, 2016",5,4,ORLANDO,FL,100000,,,,"

ORLANDO, FL                                




    Myfiance Nikosi and I met almost 4 years ago in the summer of 2012, through mutual friends. He was visiting home for the week before he was to go back to school for the Fall semester. I know its cliche to say but it was sort of love at first sight, In its own weird way. I was going thru allot at the time but he took my mind off of it all.    Unfortunately, he lived in one state and I in another. So for the past four years we would only see eachother when he came to visit from time to time. But every visit he made it seemed as if the time in between never mattered at all. We were always so comfortbale and able to be ourselves with eachother.    Finally, in January of this year to my surprise he decided to move closer to me . Since the day he arrived, we've been darn near inseperable. Neither of us expected things to be so perfect, but I believe everything happened how it was suppose to, in its own perfect timing. Nikosi would always tell me if we really gave this a chance it could be beautiful and it has been.     On March 13th of this year Nikosi proposed to me on his birthday in church in front of all our loved ones. I was so surprised and overwhelmed to say the least. I had been asking him everyday in the weeks leading up to his birthday what he wanted and finally found out that day. In his proposal, he said all he wanted for his Birthday was to spend the rest of his life with me. Oh how the water works came lol. We've accomplished the biggest of the battle , finding true love. Now we are left with task of planning a wedding and it can be quite overwhleming at times.      I am 21 years old and he is 23 but im so proud to be young, black, and in love. We have both been saving towards having a beautiful wedding but it has not been easy. We are hoping and praying that we can get married at the end of August for that is the time in which we met eachother 4 long years ago. The money we are raising would be going towards having the Wedding , Wedding reception, and our HoneyMoon. We would be ever so thankful if our story touches your heart and inspires you to help us make this very special day a reality.

                        Hi, we are Mr. Kyle and Mrs. Tsvetana Dondero and we were recently married May 16th, 2016!We are reallyexcited to start a life together, a Russian woman and an Italian man, two worlds that are quite literally colliding, and we would really appreciate your help.Who knew that you could make cherry raviolis and serve them with sour cream, followed by a cannoli and espresso? Or that anchovies are dear and near to the Russian heart as they are on a Sicilian pizza? These are some of the fun facts that have learned along the way and hope to learn more new, and interesting, things as we grow old together.We started this GoFundMe account as a way for our family and friends to support our new adventure as newlyweds.  The money raised will be used to help us in a number of ways: 1) Wedding Reception($4,000)- to help with the costs associated with bringing family and friends together in a few weeks.2) Moving/Used Car($2,000)- to help us settle into a new life near Atlanta, GA. We are driving with just the essentials, physical gifts would be too hard to transport. A used car is already lined up!3) Safety Net($1,500)- with new careers, we look forward creating a healthy saving account. This money will be used to help us pay for essentials until we are firmly established within our careers. Both of us are in transition.4) Honeymoon($1,500)- we are avid travelers and looking forward to seeing the world! Our first tripis to sunny Florida to enjoy the clear blue waters and white sandy beaches...and of course try the recommeded Delray beach favorite dish: Cheese and pear ravioli with White truffle cream sauce!It means a lot to us to have such wonderful and supportive family and friends, so any gift, large or small, is greatlyappreciated. Knowing that we will have financial support while we make this transition into married life and a new place will give us a deep peace of mind.Thank you again, from our new family to yours,Mr. Kyle& Mrs. Tsvetana Dondero

I guess that shows how many weddings I've planned.After8.5 years of anticipation, I couldn't bring myself to just sit back and plan a mediocre wedding. I have poured every last cent that I have (and then some, thanks Capital One!) into the wedding of my dreams, and we really can't afford a honeymoon.If you happen to have a few bucks to spare, please help us go on a honeymoon. I don't often ask for help, and there are so many more worthy causes you could be donating to, but I figured the worst thing that could happen is that this account was made for naught. And that's ok!!! What do I have to lose?? Anything helps!

                        Hey guys, Dain here!As you know, I'm getting married on July 16th, here on the beautiful island of Kauai! My lovely fiance Auika, and I have family and friends traveling from all over to be with us on our special day....but as you can imagine, it is no easy task to get here. That's where this link comes in! Three of the best friends a guy could ask for, ( Ralph, Burton, Cheston)are stranded in LA and have no way to get to Kauai for my wedding. So I figured I would take the time to reach out to those who are willing, and able to help out! We need just enough for three plane tickets, and while I hate asking for help, this was our final option!Plus like........Burton is the minister for the ceremony, so it's pretty important that he gets there.Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and thank you for your donations!!!

Porcupine Cafe',$75 ,"$75,000 ",Newlyweds," January 18, 2016",2,8,VENTURA,CA,140000,,,12,"






                            Porcupine Smith
                            
                            
                                                           
VENTURA, CA                                




My name is Porcupine Smith (yes! real legal name) I'm 53 years oldand recently got married for the first time. My now wife Gaby, has a 14 year old son. I've had many different jobs over the years and when I was single was satisfied living as a ""starving artist"" going from one job or gig to the next and from one place to the next. Now I am finally married and have been renting a house for over a year. Her son goes to the local middle school and is looking forward to attending high school next year.



I have had over a hundred different jobs in the last 35 years and am now trying to settle down (have a regular long time permanent residence to call home) I recently got a job at Target. I was hired as a seasonal employee with the implication that I could become a permanent employee after the holiday season and I mentioned to the manager that I was now married with a stepson and wife to support and really need along termfull time job.



He said he would see what he could do but on Jan. 6, 2016 I was laid off with all the other seasonal employees. They said I was an excellent employee and worker and would give me the highest reference but just didn't have a job to offer me.



I was very taken back by this because I worked really hard over the holidays to try my best to secure a full time permanent job at Target. It just didn't happen, now my savings are almost exausted and I am applying for about 20 to 30 jobs a day online but because of my ""gaps in employment history"" and unusual name (yes! Porcupine; real legal name) It took me about 3 years just to get the Target job. Even if It takes only a couple months for me to get a job. They just don't tend to last; I have been faithful, loyal and dependable to employers but they on the other hand throw me away on a whim! Like they did at Target even though I did a ""verified"" excellent job.



I need money to start my own business and/or support myself, my wife and stepson for about a year, by then I should be able to againsecure a regular income sufficient to sustain the rest of my life.



Without assistanceI feel that I may surely be homless within a few months. Icomplete 20 to 30 job apps onlinea day; but as evidenced by the recent job at Target; even if I would land a ""regular job"" with a big company like Target and do well; there is still no guarantee of any regular income.



If it was just me and/or me andmy dog Fred,as it had been for the last 40 years I would not fear having to live out of my car but due to having now a wife and her 14 year old son. I am scared for them and me.



Please either donate some basic funds for living or indicate that you wish to fund the capitol for me to start my own restaurant 'The Porcupine Cafe'which I estimate to be 50 to $75,000 dollars. Anyone who has ever owned a restaurant knows that it takes that much these days just to open a small restaurant and I need money to live on for the first year or so;until I would a generate acash flow.



I am most sincere about this and strait forward. I'm just a guy who once lived on the road,out of his car and was more or less fine with it but now having a wife and kid cannot go back to that and have tried everything in the name of God and Jesus and prayed to God and Jesus but yet regular work and a regular paycheck illudes me.



I'm responsible with money. Don't drink, smoke or take drugs of any kind and niether does my wife. We are Christians. Note: I will also take a job in my area or surrounding area if someone has one, but please don't send me links to jobsites etc. Only if you are a business owner who actually has a job for me.For the reason that I have probably already applied there. Also because I'm at the point where I need a job or money ASAP

Sincerely Porcupine Smith

WARREN, MI                                





                        Hi Friends!I'm Pastor Millard with Waltham G.B. Church. I need your help. The church & I have been doing what we can to see that these children have food, clothes, shoes, etc. Theses children are orphans & go without food 4 to 7 days at a time. They drink tea & water much more often than they eat. The church & myself with help from the good Lord, have managed to get them from being homeless, into a 4 room house. Amazingly, the house only cost $600.00 US dollars. We have been doing what we can for the last few years, to see that they at least have food. But we can't do this alone. They continue to go hungry more than they see food. Our sister in the Lord, Hina, who is a young woman herself, works a full month only to be able to provide food for these children for 1 week. $70 a month is all she is paid if she is blessed with a job. The small church I pastor is all the help Hina and these children receive. Without any knowledge of our sister in the Lord Hina, who has taken these children in, or the children themselves, I have taken it upon myself to ask for any help I can get, to help these children. I know not everyone is able to help. But for anyone who is able to help, I'm asking you to please do so. Only $50.00 provides food for 7 to 8 people 3 times a day for a week. I'm not asking for a $50 donation. No donation is so small that it can't help. Any amount you are able to donate to this fund, will make a huge difference in the lives of these kids.If you're unable to make a donation please remember these children and Hina in prayer. If you are able to make a donation please do so, and help us help them. No donation is to small. We send them help via Western Union when able. I keep the sent, and the pick up notifications for anyone to see that 100% of any help goes to these children. These children and sister Hina are extremely poor Christians in Pakistan.Won't you please help us help these children! Thank you so much. God Bless Us All.

                        We have been together now for 11 years and it's time for us to tie the knot (by this point I'm pretty sure he is the one, :-p ). We are on a difficult road, I had no idea how expensive getting married was, we are aiming to get through this financially sane. So in lieu of gifts we are asking for whatever amount you could spare, we greatly appreciate it. We feel so blessed to have known so many great souls and are excited to start this next chapter of our lives.

We are overjoyed and excited to share such an amazing celebration with all of our family and friends.Jamie and I discussed in great detail what we wanted to do for our wedding when it came to gifts and to be honest, we decided that taking our first trip together as wife and wife would be the most amazing gift in the world to us. At this point we are pretty much paying for our wedding on our own and BOY, does this thing get EXPENSIVE. If you are uncomfortable giving cash gifts, we completely understand.REMEMBER: Your presence on our special day is more important than a gift to us.Anything you can donate would be greatly appreciated to making our honeymoon a memorable one. One penny, a nickle, a dollar... It will all add up. :)We truely look forward to spending our big day with all of you. Even those of you who are unable to be present physically, we will have you with us in spirit. Thank you so much for supporting our new journey we are starting together.

Thank you for clicking and hearing our story, we already love you:~)As with so many discoveries about each other that were so uniquely similar; scary movies, mountains, video games, beaches, Star Trek!, etc... We both have dreamed about the having the exact same 'Bucket list' Honeymoon! A Super relaxing, overwater bungalow in Bora Bora, here is a video of the expereiance we're extremely greatful of your help to achieve:

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUMevdZJnL4We worked hard and saved up and were soooo close but... ahh life... We had to move recently resulting in our savings for this dream and our wedding being almost entirely diminished. We'll be getting Married in July and our trip is planned for November. Instead of wedding gifts or shower gifts any contributions; large or even a couple bucks, to making our dream come true would be a huge help and greatly appreciated. VIbes are valuable too, so even if you can't show us some love at this time spreading the love to anyone you know who loves us would also be an act of love we love for which we love you very much!Thanks for the love!Melina and Erik

HOW DID YOU MEET?We met online almost 20 years ago, and it only took that long of our beingfriends to realize we were perfect for each other the whole time.  They always say you find love when you stop looking. I stopped, he stopped, and we realized we were in love with each other the entire time.WHY ARE WE ASKING FOR HELP?I have been suffering from Crohn's Disease since I was about 7 or 8 years old. Then, when I was 28, I ended up withadvanced stage 4 carcinoidcancer found in my intestines. I had to have two surgeries, and I'm still due for more follow ups, as it has entered my lymph nodes.  I just found this out recently, and I'm waiting to find out if I need to start Chemotherapy or Radiation Therapy. The medical bills I have are out of control, and that is why I am here asking for some help.  Unfortunately, at the time of first finding out about the cancer, I did not have good medical insurance and mybills are still way over $50,000 that I just don't have. After all this, I had an accident in my home and hurt my lower back to the point where I now have 6 screws and 2 rods in my back that leave me in constant pain.At the time this was all going on, I was engaged to someone else and my mother had paid for a wedding (literally everything for 150 people!) and then I was told by my ex that ""I didn't realize how much more sickness there would be than health."" Ouch. So my mom is out the money, and I don't want to ask her for any more so I'm trying to raise some funds to pay for a verysmall wedding on my own.  I'm planning for 2016, afternoon wedding, not too many people - so it will be mostly family. I'll even keep everyone here updated on my plans with photos and any new plans made. So, that is my story. Please help us outif you can, anything counts! John has a son from a previous marriage, so he is also included in everything. Both John and I are disabled - me for my back and John for being a severe type 2 Bipolar that only lives day to day with medication. We have a very limited income (especially with a teenager!) and are trying everything we can to make this a beautiful day on an extremely tight budget. I love this man with everything I have, and I so want us to have a special day to remember. I don't expect to hit the $5,000- but anything we do get is MUCH appreciated.WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO WITH THE MONEY?I obviously need a cheap dress. Most of the expenses are going towards a rental hall and food and some small flowers. Whatever is left over will be going towards medical bills. So thanks for that, too!WHY SHOULD I HELP? Unfortunately, half of our friends won't be invited because we are trying to do a very small, afternoon wedding. Just want to keep it smalland intimate. Photos will be posted before, and after to keep YOU abreast of our decisions. Thank you in advance for all of your help!Tara, John and Hunter <3

Financial gifts aswedding gifts.


Hi, my name is John. At the beginning of 2016, I wrote out my ""bucket list"" for the year. One of the items was to remain a bachelor for the whole of 2016. I had been through a divorce, had tried dating a few people and realized that I wasn't ready. As fate (or I would rather call it ""destiny"") had it, no sooner had I decided to remain a bachelor than I met the most amazing woman named Michelle and everything changed!


Now, we are getting married! We are tying the knot. I will be closing down my Chiropractic practice in Colorado Springs to move to Loveland, CO in August.


Starting a new practice takes a lot of time, effort and money. We are asking all those ""well-wishers"" who desire to give some type of gift to us for our upcoming wedding to consider making a financial donation instead.


The funds contributed will go towards defraying the costs of starting a new Clinic in the Loveland area as well as contribute to our new start as a married couple.


We are so grateful for your friendship and generosity. Regardless of your ability to give we hope that you are able to join us for our celebration!


PS: I have revised my ""bucket list"" :^)

He knew the whole time that he wanted to be with me for the rest of our lives. Even though it took me a long time to see it, I decided he was the one I was going to share my story with. In 2009, we started dating (for the third time since middle school) and got engarged shortly after.We never wanted to get married right then at 18 years old; our engagement was more of a promise than anything else. We knew we would stick it out through thick and thin, and we have.It's been 5 and a half years, and we are finally stable enough to feel like getting married is somehing feasible. We always wanted the wedding of our dreams, and not just something saying we got married and could reap tax benefits (oh joy). So we waited and waited until now.Halloween this year we are getting married, rain or shine. We have our venue and catering ready, but there are some small things we could really use some help getting set up. As of this writing, we have 24 weeks (approximately). That's 12 paychecks. We can cover everything, but there won't be much of a honeymoon at the end of it all if we do.So, in leiu of getting a registry and buying us stuff (since we've lived together so long there's not much we really need), we would like to ask that any money you would use to buy us physical gifts be given here. This money will be used to order our invitations at the $250 mark, order my dress when we reach another $500, and get our centerpieces/flowers ordered every $150 after that. We are putting our goal at half of what the wedding is costing us so far, but we don't necessarily need to reach that. Everything after the first $1000 or so is going to be used for the honeymoon to Spokane, WA we are taking.Any and all contributions are VERY much appreciated. We'll update the offer rewards with different things that we will do for you. Everyone will receive ""Thank You"" cards, for any donations. Just make sure to send your address along with it.We love all of you, friends, family, and even any strangers that happen to see this and know that we are just trying to make a night worth remembering that celebrates our love.Thank you all, so very much.The Future Mrs. Hamlin,Catherine

Shmilie & Duddy's Sefer Torah,"$14,864 ","$43,000 ",Newlyweds," December 26, 2014",111,21,BROOKLYN,NY,70000,,,7,"






                            Shmilly Duddy Halpern
                            
                            
                                                           
BROOKLYN, NY                                





                                                Shmili and Dudi H. are not just ordinary people. They are special young men, special in many ways. At a young age they were diagnosed as being mentally disabled. But even though they cant read or write, they always try to be part of the crowd. They always participate in shul by davening as much as they know by heart from listening to others, singing along, etc. They always participate at simchas, and family events, and being that they are very social and outgoing, everyone enjoys being in their presence. Wherever they go they bring happiness to others, and they always bring smiles on peoples faces.Whenever anyone they know makes a simchah especially when their siblings get engaged, married, or have babies, Shmili & Dudi become very happy for them, they go around spreading the word, and sometimes even start dancing out of joy. But deep down they sometimes feel a little sad about themselves every time a sibling has a simchah. When will it be their turn? When will they be standing under the chuppah? Will they ever get married? Will they ever make a simchah? How they wish so much to have everyone go over to them & wish them mazel tov. After many years, their family has decided to bring their dream to fruition; they came up with an interesting solution. A sefer torah will be written in their name & will be given in to their fathers shul. They will be the baalei simchah!! Its as if they are getting married!! At the grand celebration, which will be held at the completion of the writing of the sefer torah, they will be the ones under the chuppah holding their sefer torah in their hands dancing on the streets full of joy!! Everyone will go over to them & wish them a hearty mazel tov, yes; they will be making their own simchah at last!! After all there will be something that will live on their memory!!And so it was that after a lot of work and planning Shmili and Dudis siblings have taken it upon themselves to fundraise the large amounts that are needed to start writing a sefer torah. And, after several weeks of collecting funds it has finally come the time, and the starting of the writing of the sefer torah has begun. Boruch Hashem, several months have passed and a nice sum of money has already been raised, and the writing of the sefer torah is well underway. But a large sum of money is still needed to cover the expenses of the remainder of the writing of the sefer torah, and for all its accessories (the mantel, the atzei chaim, the gartel, the silver crown, and the grand celebration at its completion). Therefore Shmili and Dudi, and all their friends and family, are asking from all of you out there, to please help in this great mitzvah, and help them bring their lifelong dream to fruition. Please donate with an open heart, and you should all be blessed with healthy kids and much nachas. May we all merit the days of moshiach in the near future.

Genesis 2:24 ESVMarriage is a beautiful gift from God and amazing transition into a new journey in life. Scripture commands us to rejoice with those who rejoice and to mourn with those who mourn, this is definitely a cause to rejoice! Brandi and I would like to invite you to share in this celebration with us and help to make it as special as possible. As the date gets closer and time shortens when both of us will become one we thought about things we would need to begin our new journey, and gifts we would like to receive from those who love us and would like show appreciation for this momentous milestone in our lives. We decided that what is most important to us going forward is loving and enjoying each other. With that being said we chose not to do a huge registry for gifts but to ask those who would to take whatever they would find in their hearts and budgets to spend on gifts to instead contribute to making our honeymoon a time together that we will never forget, and look back on for the rest of our lives together here on earth. Thank you for your love, consideration and continued support,The Watkins!

Because we are young, money for us is tight, and it's been tough for us to start out in creating our life together. It's our dream honeymoon to go to Disneyland together, as neither of us have been! We have very little money to make this dream come true, and we are doing our absolute best to try to save up. Our wedding is in June, and we are hoping to be able to raise enough money by then to embark on this Disney dream adventure! It would mean so much to us to be able to start our lives together in the place where dreams come true, and any amount given will be appreciated greatly! We are so thankful for everyone that helps us in this dream of ours, and we are very excited at the chance of being able to go to Disneyland! Thank you all so much, and please help us reach our goal so that we can have our dream Disneymoon.

                        We are Reuben and Amanda. An extremely loving couple who have been through ups and downs and are finally with the person we each deserve.We recieved the news that in order to have a family, medical help would be needed. The proposal was magical and finally done right for both of us. We originally had a planned wedding for March 2017 but due to our news we decided that we wanted to go through the emotional and long process of Invitro as a loving married couple.Due to this we moved our wedding to September of this year. With such short notice we decreased our budget and limited what we could do for our dream wedding and honeymoon. All this while having to pay for medical expenses, past, present and in the future.Please help us have the wedding we deserve so we can have the loving family we also deserve.We thank you greatly for your gift and support.

We are headed to Australia for a fresh and bright adventure! However, it will be difficult to take many of your gifts with us (our suitcases won't leave much room for your awesome gifts).Instead, we are asking for donations. Jeff and Kate in the Everglades, 2015We can't wait to see all that Australia has to offer in the three years we'll be abroad, while Jeff gets his PhD. All donations will go toward getting us to our new home with our three dogs. You will be part of making this incredible chapter in our lives happen.Violet, Benny, and Duke

We were going to throw a jack and jill party to help with wedding expenses but we didn't have money to get a venue AND this is easier for our friends and family who are out of town that can't make it to the party to donate. We have lived together for a while and don't need much for the house so we don't really need any gifts. But if u would like to donate as a gift that would be awesome!!! *ALL the money is going to wedding expenses thanks guys u rock :)

It's never easy telling a personal story to the world, especially when asking for just a little bit of help- but I'll give it my best shot.I'm creating this Go-Fund-Me page because while my wife and I are making ends meet, we do live paycheck to paycheck.We're typical Americans. We get up each day, we go to work, we pay our bills and are responsible adults. On occasion we manage to pinch together a little bit that is left over and go out to dinner with friends, but that is a treat. We don't live glamorous lives by any stretch of the imagination.This year has been tough on us both. We moved from the DC area to Pennsylvania because she got a job offer in her field and I spent a year out of work- not for lack of trying, there just isn't much work to find in Central Pennsylvania. I worked as many part time jobs as I could find- at one time I had four different jobs at the same time, usually in the same day. I did this because I did what I had to do to help make ends meet. We fell behind on some bills, lived on credit cards to eat, pay other bills and keep a roof over our heads and the heads of our furry kids.I finally found a full time job and we couldn't be more grateful that the tide started turning. Getting caught up on things is a lot slower of a process than getting in trouble in the first place that is for sure.I turn 40 this year. And my wife has never been out of the country. After all that we have been through, the stress of the move, the daily grind- I want to take her on a real vacation. And that is why I'm here. I don't want to raise money just to pay another bill. That's all our lives revolve around now. I want to take her on the honeymoon we never got because life kept rolling at break neck speed as soon as we got married- all of our savings put aside in order to fund our future- which thankfully we did because it kept us out of the fire for a minute when I couldn't find work. But thatwent fast. And I just want to take her to a place where we can put our toes in the sand and momentarily forget about reality and the responsibility that we honor in our daily lives. Five days away to relax and reconnect with each other.If there is even a few dollars that you could donate, we would be so grateful.Thank you for taking the time to read this even if you are unable to give.

                            Elizabeth Brewer Lagaaia
                            
                            
                                                           
HONOLULU, HI                                





                        You know how you used to hear about the crazy coincidences that bring specific people together, and you would wonder if those stories were true? Well, have I got one for you.My name is Elizabeth, but friends and family call me Lisa. It's a play on my mom's name, Elisapeta, which is the Samoan versionof mine. For some reason, she always went by Peta, and I always went by Lisa. Anyway, my mom was my best friend, although I didn't always know or acknowledge it. She wasn't perfect, but man, I couldn't have asked for a more loving and supportive friend. She always knew when I needed a kick in the pants, or a shoulder to cry on. And she never complained that I was a stubborn and petulant child. Instead, she loved me harder,despite my making it hard for anyone to love me. But I digress.In the spring of 2012, everything changed. One night, at the end ofan episode of Wheel-of-Fortune (oh how Momloved that show), just as the final contestant answered the final puzzle correctly and successfully won a million dollars, my wonderful and loving mother had a stroke. I almost blame the excitement of that million-dollar win for causing her heart to beat faster than normal, moving the clots in her blood ever faster towards her brain. This is a ridiculous theory, of course, but I haven't been able to watch that game show ever since.We spent 9 months in hospital together, and if I ever doubted how strong Momwas before that, I had absolutely no doubts afterwards. After falling into a coma the first month, due to the swelling of her brain, and after the doctors informed me that I needed to prepare to make a ""hard choice"" because it was unlikely she would ever wake up again, my beautiful mother opened her eyes on Mother's Day 2012 and clearly recognized us all.Sadly, thestory doesn'tend there, andthis was just the beginning of the hardest year of my life. By the end of the year, Mom would have consciouslyendurednumerous emergency surgeries, several ""code blue"" events, constant life-support, emergency round-the-clock dialysis, and long stays on each of the hospital's 4 distinctICU wards, to name a few of the worst, and I would have lost my greatest friend and advocate. I was there for all that she went through, and I attest to her strength and good nature because, despite all she had to endure, she still found it possible to smile for her children. Who could smile through pain like that, if not an incredibly strong and determined individual? I will never know how she did it, but I will spend my life trying to find the strength that she had.My purpose in recounting all of this is not to solicit pity or sympathy, but rather to illustrate fully exactly what was lost the day that she died.So. Eight months later in the summer of 2013, and my life wasstill upside-down.I decided I wouldtravel abroad, like we had planned to dohad Mom recovered. I would travel to see my Grandma in the motherland of my people. Samoa. A small decision that would prove to change my life yet again.I met Lalolamaduring the second week of my trip. He had just returned to the village himself the week before, coming home early from his mission in the Phillipines. If not for that, we never would have met and this story would be very different.Lama had kind eyes and a kind smile, but still I laughed and rolled my eyes at his shy advances. I was certainly not looking to complicate my life any further, and I had more walls around my heart than should be humanly possible. But there he was. I deflected Lama'sadvances with sighsand excuses.I was determined that we should just be friends. But there he was. I'm not even sure how he did it, but at onepoint it was finally clear to me that we could not remain simply friends. My trip to Samoa lasted six months, four months longer than originally planned, and when I came home again I knew I wanted to marry the man I had left behind in another country. I found myself a good job, got my ownapartment, got my life together again, and finally stopped living off of my family. That was the spring of 2014. I had been unemployed and stumblingthrough lifefor almost 2 years.We tried for a year to find a way for Lama to come to the U.S. so we could be married here, but that wasn't meant to be.In the spring of 2015 I flew to Samoa, and we were married there instead. We had a wonderful two weeks together, and my only regret is that my mother was not able to meet the man that she had been waiting my whole life for me to meet.Unfortunately, I had to say goodbye to my new husband at the end of those amazing two weeks without knowing when we would see each other again. It is now almost a year later, which brings me to the reason for this long story.Our one year anniversary is approaching in April 2016, and try as we haveto save the money needed for a reuniontrip, thishas been nearly impossible for usto do. I still don't know when my husband will be allowed to live in the U.S. with me (although his papers are finally in process!), but having a chance to reunite for our first year milestone would be such a welcome shot of hopefor our future. Thankfully, life in Samoa is simple and we wouldn't need much to get by. Any monies donated to our cause would be used for my airfare from the U.S. and for our accommodationsabroad.So that's ourstory. Two people who met at the right time and fell in love, and who are now forced by circumstances to live apart until some unforseeable day in the future. On behalf of my husband (who has no idea I'm doing this) and myself, Iexpress our gratitude to you all for reading our story and for considering how you might be able to help us to be reunited.Thank you very much,Lama and Lisa

                        About three years ago we met and instantly clicked. We came from very similar backgrounds, had the same sense of humor, shared similar outlooks on life in general... Heck! We even named our pets the same name! Having been in other relationships that didn't pan out... We both instantly knew we were a match. It felt different this time. It felt right for the first time! Fast forward a couple of years later and we were engaged while on a wonderful vacation in Ashton's hometown. We started making grand plans to be married the following year... Then life happened (as it often does). Matt's restaurant was sold leaving im without his upper management position he loved and depended on. It was a difficult few months but we survived! We optimistically pushed the wedding back a year... We have the rest of our lives together and plenty of time we thought.This year has brought a new set of challenges from job changes, to issues with our beloved Lewis's (our lab/husky mix) health. Sadly, his health has declined and the vet bills have taken their toll. To make matters more difficult, the day we always feared recently came and we had to say goodbye to our sweet captain.But we keep going ahead and when life throws you a curveball you hit it out of the park!We recently decided to change our plans for a big flashy steampunk spectacle of a wedding to a more intimate and affordable family and friends weekend. We found an amazing rental home called ""The Great Escape Lakeside"" in nearby Groveland, FL and we are planning on having our families and friends stay together and have some fun getting to know one another. Please check out the website at: http://www.greatescapelakeside.com/index.html

This place was built for fun as each room is themed and filled with hundreds of games. It sleeps 45 people and has everything from a lazy river, water slide, human bowling, laser tag, a night club, and even a movie theater!! The best part is, it's less expensive than our original plans, will allow us to manage our own dining options, it includes everyone's accommodations and will allow us to hold the ceremony and reception on its sprawling grounds. We are prepared to pay for the majority of the event but are requesting a little help from our family to get things off the ground. Since this will include everyone's accommodations, we are hoping you won't mind paying a little for a fun family vacation getaway. Our goal is to raise enough for the deposit which is just about $1800 as soon as possible so we can lock in our dates. Then, it's just a matter of time until the fun, memories, and mushy stuff begins! Of course, we will be incredibly thankful to anyone who can help us get started! Thanks for your consideration and much love!

Amy is my best friend and she is marrying the love of her life on August 15, 2015. They are getting married in California then moving up to Oregon to finish their last semester at the university where they met. If they dont have a car before theyre married, they will need to pay for transportation from California to Oregon. Beyond that, they need a car so they can commute for their jobs and otherwise get around.Recently Amy paid $1600 on a car, which she believed was a gift from God. She had been praying for a car and an opportunity came at the perfect time to do so. However, it didnt take long to realize the gift from God was not the car itself, but rather the experiences she went through and lessons she learned when things turned sour.The car she paid for had a few issues, so she knew it would take some money to fix up, including the purchase of a new door for $500 (which she put a $325 down payment on). When she took the car in for a smog check, it would not pass. The California DMV requires a car to have valid smog certificate before transferring the title to a new owner. Getting the car smog checked is the sellers responsibility so Amy was doing her a favor by taking it in herself. What Amy did not know was that there were more issues with the car than she knew about when she handed over half her savings for it. It was going to cost thousands of dollars to make repairs for the car to pass the smog test. Because the car could not pass the smog check, she could neither transfer the title to her name to register the vehicle until all the mechanical problems were taken care of. Theoretically, the seller is supposed to pay for any repairs to bring the car to smog certification standards. The seller refused to make such payments. The best option seemed to go back to square one. Amy would get a refund and the seller would maintain possession of the car. When Amy suggested this solution, the seller would not give her the money back (most likely because the money had been spent on her new cars down payment). The seller said she would keep Amys $1600 but would pay Amy to return the title.The next option was to take the seller to court to recover the costs.Amy is a wonderful woman. What she chose to do instead really impacted me and is the reason why I want to help her raise the funds for a new car.She decided to forgive the seller, allowing her to keep the car and the money. Amy admits it was a hard decision for her and Andrew to come to.I had a hard time understanding this at first, but this is how she explained it to me:1. My money is not my own. I am not entitled to it. Yes I worked hard for it, but everything is ultimately God's.2. Most people Ive talked to about this have declared the seller a bad, mean person. One person said Karma will come back to haunt her. Its surprising how most people think that if someone does bad to you, you need to do bad back (or at least hope something bad happens). Were supposed to bless those who curse you (Luke 6:28), turn the other cheek (Matthew 5:38-40), love your enemy (Matthew 5:43). These are the things we need to live out. 3. I have a hard time with the idea of taking someone to court. How is that turning the other cheek? Considering the money is really God's and I'm supposed to turn the other cheek, taking [the seller] to court is the opposite of that.4. I can't represent Christ when fighting her. I am called to be a peacemaker.5. I've learned thatin the last year that you have to figure out whether you value the person or the feeling of being right. I truly value [the seller] and want the best for her. Shes a broken person in a broken world; she needs someone to show her grace. As much as I want her to admit she was wrong, I have to admit my own pride and sense of entitlement, and walk away from this.6. I want what's just and right, but my definitions don't always match God's. Vengeance is not for me to carry out. Justice doesnt mean taking her to court and getting my money back, especially if that sets her back in her life.We all can learn a lesson from Amys story. Now, lets stand up in agreement with the decisions she and Andrew made to forgive, and help her raise some money for a new car (dont worry, shell make sure its smog checked first)!

OUR HAPPILY EVER AFTERGreg & I met back in Chicago, Illinois in March of 2011. Our love story was a beautiful one. We knew right away that this was different. It almost didn't feel real. We moved in together after just weeks of dating, adopted Sadie within 6 months of dating, and continued to grow as individuals but also as a couple. When Sadie turned 1 we adopted Honey. Our family of four was all we needed...except it wasn't. We felt as if we were at a stand still. We craved some type of adventure. A new start. So we did something about it.Fast forward to 2013 when we decided to leave everything we knew behind and move to Colorado. This was the best decision we have ever made but at the same time one of the hardest. I hated being away from all I've ever known: my friends, my family. I knew though, that this was the right move for our family and for our health and happiness. Since moving out here we have experienced so many new things together, visited so many beautiful places, and faced many fears. We have gained amazing friends, we are both happy with our careers, and most importantly we have found a love for Jesus. Greg & I were baptized in January of 2015and we have never looked back. We have gained an amazing church family, and a new sense of strength. I truly believe that every single thing that has happened in our lives has led us here.As most of you know, weeks before I met Greg he lost his Mom unexpectedly. This is something that has weighed heavily on our hearts for almost 5 years now. We tried everything we could to heal from such a tragedy. Some were healthy, but most were not. Seeing Greg at rock bottom I knew we needed a change. That is what sent us to Colorado. Through friends that we have met here (and amazing family that encouraged us) we have found God again. Out of everything we have tried to heal...nothing has given Greg (and myself) the strength to get through each day like the love of our Father. I am so proud of all of the lifestyle changes that Greg and I have made since making this move across country. One of the scariest things we have ever done, was also the most rewarding. I thank each and every one of you that has helped us through our tough days. Who answered our calls when we were at our weakest. We wouldn't be where or who we are today without each and every one of you. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Friends, strangers, whoever is reading:We decided to do a GoFund Me page because we have to pay for our wedding ourselves. We were able to save every dollar, every penny. We are getting married at the Red Rocks. This is really important to us because when we first came out to Colorado, we got off the plane and went directly to the Red Rocks. I remember getting out of the car and seeing this beautiful scene right in front of me. It was unlike anything we've ever seen. We looked at each other and we just knew, this was going to be our new home. We took every dollar in savings and we packed our bags and we made the move. We knew that we wanted to get married here because it was where our life truly began. We were able to pay for the ceremony, and a small reception at our church. The only thing we will not be able to afford is a honeymoon. We both work so hard, we never have time to even think about it really. Now that it is 3 months away, it is dawning on us...wow. We aren't going to be able to celebrate all this hard work. We don't need anything fancy. All we want is to get away, turn off our phones, and enjoy each other. No work, no troubles, no stress. We don't really understand why we are making this page. Why would strangers pay to help us go on a honeymoon? All I know is that ever since we have been saved we know that there is kindness out there. People do have the hearts, and the ability, to see good. To do good. To change someones life. To change our life.We appreciate you taking the time to read our story. Whether this works, or it doesn't, I am just blessed to call Greg my future husband. Whatever we do, or do not do, we will be okay because we have each other. Thank you!Jen & GregA look into the day I said ""yes!"" ....We are blessed to live in such a beautiful state..We still have to rep the chicago blackhawks in Colorado though....Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Jen & Greg

I have been given $350.00 toward this from the VA.  Our goal is to have access to the morning sun on a patio for our health.This project would mean so much to us, to better our lives and would allow both of us and our soon to be new Pet, which will need its initial check up and shots to enjoy the outdoor sun.All these things are out of our reach without your help. So please help.Any help with this would truly be appreciated.Ken & Jeffp.s. We are also raising moneyfor our wedding and honeymoon.

We initially began planning our wedding right away. Sometimes life events occur that we do not anticipate. Milton and I both work in the non-profit to help youth in our community, so our incomes don't allow for many unexpected expenses. Like the love we have for each other, we do not give up hope and we continue to pinch our pennies and strive for what we can. We have done our research and found one of the lowest cost local venues that include the ceremony, food, cake, and our suite for the wedding night. We have been very fortunate to have a host of talented friends who have offered to help with other expenses such as offering to do the flowers for free, invitations,and providing the photography for a very low cost. I will be designing and making my own centerpieces and my friends will be helping me put them together. Despite all of this, unexpected expenses in life continue to occur and the clock keeps ticking. This wedding has been a dream we continue to strive for. Much like our love, we have no plans of giving up on making our dream come true. We have paid the deposit and part of the venue. We have the remainder of the venue to pay, the Deejay, tux rentals, wedding dress, officient, and clothing for children for the ceremony. We need the funds by September 1, 2016. Asking for help is the last thing we wanted to do. Know that we appreciate any amount you can help with. Any help is very much appreciated!

                        Our love story began back in 2011, although we didn't know it at the time. I met Naomi at Capernwray Bible School in England and it was months before either of us noticed each other. The first interaction between us that Naomi can recall is when a group of us were watching Disney's Robin Hood in the conference hall and I was tapping my feet along to the music... She turned around to me and said ""I really appreciate your enthusiasm about this movie, but can you please stop that. You're shaking the entire floor."" After a while, I got up to go play a night game with some friends and she thought I had offended her, so she found me a couple days later and apologized. I had no idea what she was talking about, but I thought it was really cute anyway. For me, Naomi caught my attention when we were volunteering together at Capernwray over Easter break. We came from much different worlds and neither of us was ready for a serious relationship (especially a long distance one), but we stayed friends over Facebook and Skype despite the 2500 mile distance between us.Several years later in 2014, we reconnected and decided to meet. Naomi had always wondered ""what if things had ended differently""and I really wanted to see her again. So she came out to see me inAlbany, ORfor a week in August and I went to Orillia, ON to see her at Christmas that year.  We have been able to visit each other back and forth every couple of months and as hard (and expensive!) as it is, it's been worth it.I proposed to Naomi on Canada Day 2015 and we have been patiently waiting since then to tie the knot! Right now, Naomi is waiting to be approved for her K-1 Fiance Visa and she is planning on moving to Oregon in May. We had budgeted the cost of the wedding and immigration fees, but completely forgot to budget for the move. It costs about $3000+ CAD to drive a small U-Haul truck across the country, and right now we just don't have that.We would appreciate ANYTHING you could give to help me get my girlout to Oregon for our happily ever after!

                        Elysse Arrington and Rebecca Richter are getting hitched, and lez be honest, its not your typical courtship, nuptials, or intentions of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Nevertheless, these ladies are getting married!!     In lieu of registering at Macy's and Target for a bunch of crap they don't need, we have decided to go the route of a fund for things they DO need.Most things, we ourselves, currently have and may take for granted.    Do you have air conditioning during the humid Kentucky summers? They don't. Can you invite your pals over for a rousing game of marbles, without having to worry about them all collecting in the middle of the floor because your house doesn't sink in the middle? They can't. Do you have windows in your house that aren't broken or cracked due to drive by shootings and/or mischievous neighborhood children with rocks? They don't. Do you have a driveway that is paved or graveled that you can get in and out of without first having to call AAA? They don't. And finally, can you go to bed without having to worry if a rabid woodland creature will somehow work its way down from the attic and rip your face off in the middle of the night? They only dream of that luxury!  So get your checkbooks, cash, credit cards and EBT cards out and help donate to a great cause! Rebecca and Elysse more than deserve being able to start their lives out as Mrs. and Mrs. with some of the things that most people enjoy every day. These 2 people are a couple of the great ones in life. Let's show them how much we think so!

We(my fiance and I) take turns with jobs so one of is always home to help with the children/mother with no worries and we can't afford daycare or a home nurse, so that's our best option. Our income isn't that much and it's very hard to support all these people and plan for a wedding with such little income and such little time. I'm not asking for a million dollar wedding I just want a wedding we will remember for the rest of our lives even if it's small it will mean the world to us! Anything would help! 1$ ,50 cents, 25 cents ( it builds up). We appriciate it all!!! Our wedding is September 23rd 2016 so we have until then to reach our goal!!

                        Greetings from Eric and Jen!!We are officially engaged!! WOOHOO!!!Eric and I are trying to plan the perfect wedding on a very tight budget. I am a FT student, and work FT - but paying bills and tuition has taken up all of our reserves in savings. Eric lost hours when his store caught on fire (the Walmart that was all over BayNews9 a few weeks ago) and we are working with my mother to pull this together this coming December - just before a big family vacation. This way EVERYONE could attend.We would need the funds no later than November 15th. This would give us time to finalize all wedding arrangements, deposits, and get everything we want - as well as give us a nice small honeymoon together before I have to get back to class. Missing work time is tough and PTO only covers so much (covers bills, but not the honeymoon itself).Eric and I would be extrmemly thankful for any and all help we could get. Especially since this would mean less of a financial burden on us, and my parents who are trying to help as well. Thank you so much for your time and consideration on our behalf. We are greatful for everything that everyone has done for us to help us get this far.Thank You!!Eric and Jen

Amber and I do have some savings built up together but we are struggling to get to where we need to host the kind of celebration we're hoping for. The food and a couple other items such as the suit and dress are proving to be a little more expensive than initial estimates showed.


Even if it's not help with funding it but with planning, equipment or services we could really use some help getting this together. I want to be able to give her something special. 


If any of you can help us with any amount possible we will be very grateful. 


Thank you all for being a part of our lives. 


Love, 
Amber and Dallas

We are looking forward to our wedding and spending the rest of our lives together. It is amazing that we each get to marry our best friend!In lieu of a wedding registry, we created this gofundme page for our honeymoon, since we are not in need of any traditional wedding gifts.

Send Jim to NYC!,$822 ,$790 ,Newlyweds," December 2, 2015",27,9,ASTORIA,NY,51000,,1,,"

ASTORIA, NY                                





                        BSU fans, as you know, it's been over a year since the last viewing party - and might become yearstill the next one if we don't get your help. For years now, Jim and Eddie have been providing Rangers fans with one of the most insightful and hilarious podcasts out there - and have done it all completely free of charge.Generally, Jim is able to travel out east once a year and make the viewing party complete. However, this year is a bit more difficult. You see, not only is he selfless with the time and effort he and Eddie give to the show, but Jim has been bending over backwards for his family, thus making it financially impossible for him to make it out east this year. What's more, his brother is getting married in January. Here's where you come in - if every member of the BSU group contributes $5 or even $20, we can send Jim, Jen, and Maegan to NYC for the wedding on January 16th AND have a BSU viewing party on the 17th (vs the Caps). It would mean the world to Jim and his family if you guys can help make this happen. After all, what's a few bucks to show your appreciation for years of free entertainment?

                        On Saturday June 25th, 2016 in Gainesville, Florida my fianc Tapanat Somkang, originally from Thailand, and myself, Michael Deall will be getting married. Do to financial hardships, we are asking for help to fund her parents who live in Thailand to come to the United States to celebrate with us the ceremony. Tapanats family are retired farmers and do not have any money to travel. My parents are also retired living in Kinston, NC who live off their Social Security checks. Im funding the entire wedding myself and cannot afford to bring them over. Im asking for your help to contribute anything you can to help get them to The United States. Sadly, Tapanats father has been recently diagnosed with stomach cancer and we know that this will be the only time he will get to see the US and more importantly, his daughter becoming a bride. Words can not even express what this would mean to us, we will be eternally grateful!Thank you so much for your help!

We didnt get to have the dream wedding that I always wanted, nor did we get to go on a honeymoon beings that I was very pregnant. I see a lot of gofundme accounts for bizarre reasons, so maybe this will actually work and people will donate money so we could enjoy a vacation/honeymoon this year. That would be so amazing. I am planning the honeymoon to be on August 18-20th. (Wish it could be longer, but...work)SO with that said, if you donate. I didnt know how much to put for the goal, beings that I have never done this before. Lol. We thank you so so much! We love all of you.Love, the Weipperts <3

                        A Honeymoon Seven Years Overdue Matt and I were married in June of 2009. At the time we were both involved in activities that kept us from having a honeymoon. As I was doing an archaeological dig in Eastern Kentucky to finish up my anthropology degree and he was in the final year of working on his masters degree. Not only that but our financial situation was very rough at the time and there wasn't any way we would have been able to manage having any substantial honeymoon. Our finances are still tight but nowhere as bad as they have been in the past and finally we have the opportunity to go on a real honeymoon to Paris at the end of September. We have already arranged a place to stay while we are there and just need a boost primarily for our plane tickets and possibly for a nice dinner or two out while there.We are looking for a hand up not a hand out so have decided to offer everyone who helps us with some sort of reward from personal signed postcard size photos, to photo calendars, to custom sets of coasters and more. Anything we receive beyond what we need to use will be donated to charity: water, which is one of our favorite charities and works to provide clean drinking water to people worldwide.We appreciate anyone's help.Merci beaucoup!Melissa & Matt
