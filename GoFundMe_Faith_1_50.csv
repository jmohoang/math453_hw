In The Name of God, The Most Beneficient, The Most Merciful.We are connecting with our Muslim community in large numbers. It is changing the way Islam is being portrayed all over the world. YoungMuslims in our era are in need of role models who can connect them to their deen. We represent the Deen Squad and we truly believe that we can make a difference in the world.Our Goals:Our goal is to inspire the youth to pray,fulfill all their responsibilitiesas Muslims and volunteer their time to help give back to their community. We believe in this dream and by Allah, we strive to make all of it happen.Alone we can only do so much, but together, as a community, we can accomplish anything!Remember, everytime you help someone convert to Islam or be a support to help them fulfill good deeds, you are entitled toreceive a greatrewardfrom God in this Dunya and the hereafter.Baqarah, verse 274:Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.We have confirmed that with this budget, the Deen Squad will be able to visit different cities all over the world to spread their peaceful message. With this budget acheived, we could producegreater content for the youth to engage with. We want to creatively educate them and motivate them to pray their Salat, pay their zakat and excercise their good nature of being Muslims.We need your help to make all of this happen!Where did this idea come from?2015 was a big success for the boys. We have reached an international scale as our video ""Muslim man"" reached over 50 Million People on Facebook, making it on news channels around the whole world.Karter Zaher and Jae Deen 's Facebook pages have collectively accumulated over 1 million fans who are engaged and we want these numbers to grow bigger inshAllah.We are now receiving hundreds of messages and emails from kids, parents and organizations all around the world who see the result of our work and are asking us to continue what we are doing.This is why we are so inspired to keep pushing forward and all we ask is for a helping hand from our brothers and sisters in Islam.

What kind of effect our work will have ?Help the youth find themselves, and inspire them to embrace their religious beliefs. Also help other non muslim kids to live in harmony and peace with the muslim kids. We are creating an understanding between our community and others.A large population in the Western World are being stereotyped , neglected and excluded. Our music helps educate the world aboutthe true beauty of Islam.What you should do right now!1. Donate any amount you want, or please pick from the rewards below.2. Share this on Facebook/Twitter & contactyour family and friends who will contribute to this journey.Guiding our youth is not a small matter, and Allah's promise to greatly reward you for your charity is indeed true.Surah Baqarah, verse110 :And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah: for Allah sees Well all that ye do.

The USS Liberty story and the following deceit and cover-up to the American public to order to protect the US/Israeli relationship is a microcosm of a cancer plaguing our country today. With love of country embedded in the hearts of the Liberty crew, we have witnessed first hand the lengths politicians will use to deny the rights of U.S. Navy veterans beginning with the White House whitewash of the Navy Court of Inquiry -- the details of which should be publicly known.

Help us save our historic church!,"$4,685 ","$550,000 ",Faith," January 23, 2015",89,20,MALONE,NY,562000,3,7,"






                            Cheryl Kirk Nolette
                                                            for First Congregational Church

MALONE, NY                                




The First Congregational Church in Malone, New York is in need of financial assistance to preserve its house of worship. This beautiful historical building, which was built in 1883, is 131 years old. It was built on the same site as two previous church buildings. The building incorporates tunnels of the Underground Railroad, which provided safe passage for slaves seeking freedom before the Civil War. William A. Wheeler, who was the 19th Vice President of the United States from 1877 until 1881, was a member of this church. Visitors are always welcome to come and visit the tunnels of the Underground Railroad and learn the history of the building as well as the area.Time has taken its toll on the large stone building and on our small congregation. We were unprepared for the depth of water damage to the buttresses and foundation until a stone rolled away. Contractors were called in to assess the problems, and it was found that the rafters and walls were actually moving. This became a safety issue for the community and the church family, therefore the trustees made the bold decision to move forward with the necessary foundation work. Collapse of the church would have threatened bordering sidewalks and roads, Notre Dame Church and Arsenal Green Park across from the church, and Flanders Elementary School, a doctors office and a private residence next door. Because of the urgency of the situation, there was no time to research and apply for grants. The total bill is in excess of $800,000. We have already raised $288,000 through pledges and donations from members and friends of the congregation. Our goal is to raise $550,000 to cover the cost of the stabilization work that has been completed and finance the final phase of the project in the spring of 2015, which will ensure the continued viability of the building. Banks and Credit Unions have been visited but no help is available. The insurance company has denied our claim for damages.This church has been a beacon of hope and provided a place to worship and glorify God for generations. Historically, the congregants have been at the forefront of providing for those in need and continue to do so through missions and outreach ministries such as circle of prayer, community linen chest, collection of food for distribution to local food pantries, prayer shawl ministry, puppet ministry, Operation Christmas Child and Holiday Helpers, just to name a few. We invite you to help us continue Gods work which started over 200 years ago on this site by preserving the church building for His glory and honor.

Help Us Pay Our Rent,"$9,767 ","$12,000 ",Faith," October 7, 2015",46,11,Williamstown,VIC,57000,,4,"

An English-speaking Orthodox Christian Church for Melbourne, AustraliaWe are trying to create a home for this English-speaking Orthodox Christian Mission in Melbourne, Australia.Holy Ascension Orthodox Mission is for people interested in English Language Orthodox Christianity. Standing outside national ghettos and unedifying sectarian polemics, it looks forward to the flowering of an authentic Orthodox spirituality on Australian soil.With hope for the kindness of our Lord, we turn to our brothers and sisters in Christ and ask for your support in this effort.Who We AreWe are a small congregation (average 20 people every Sunday) of struggling Orthodox Christians. We do not even have our own place of worship yet as we are a newly established Orthodox Christian Mission with very limited funds and resources.Holy Ascension Orthodox Mission is an English language Orthodox Church of the Australian & New Zealand Diocese of ROCOR. With the blessing of Metropolitan Hilarion, Holy Ascension was founded on June 4, 2009, and by the Grace of God, it has steadily grown since then. We are also blessed to be under the guidance and pastoral care of Bishop George of Canberra, the vicar bishop of the diocese.Holy Ascension Mission is made up of a diverse group of people and we maintain our schedule of services entirely in English. We have established a Mission Council, a Sisterhood, a Brotherhood, a Choir, and a Sunday School for the religious education of our children. Help Us Meet Our Immediate GoalWe hire a hall from the local Williamstown Uniting Church - Electra St, as our Missions temporary home until we can afford a place of our own. We have been at this location since February 2015. The use of this hall requires additional rent for 2016. Please help us to meet our rental payment. Our community is not wealthy and so the challenge of meeting the rent for 2016 is an awesome task. Therefore, we are seeking assistance from friends and family beyond our Mission boundaries. We have asked our faithful to contact family and friends humbly requesting prayerful and financial help, a one-time donation toward the rent, which can be made in Memory or in Honour of someone, too. If you would please help us by considering a donation to our campaign, large or small, we would be forever in prayer for your intentions.We do not receive any financial assistance from either the diocese or the government (state or federal) or any philanthropic organization to make this a reality. Nor is it incumbent upon them to support us in such a manner.Also, the Mission clergy do not receive any stipend from the diocese, but instead have to take up secular employment and rely upon the charity of the faithful.We rely purely upon the grace of God and the generosity of the people. If you have the means to help us, please support us with your generous donations. All donors will be commemorated at all the services in the litanies, for the founders of this holy Mission If you would like to donate a larger sum, you and your loved ones will be included in our memorial book and your names will be commemorated during the proskomedia at every the Divine Liturgy.What we needWe have negotiated with the Williamstown Uniting Church to use the hall at 32 Electra St as our Missions temporary place of worship (until we can afford to buy a place of our own). This means that we can have a regular cycle of daily and weekly services (all in English), be a place of fellowship for all who genuinely desire to learn about Orthodoxy Christianity, be a safe environment for our Sunday School and be a base for catechism, and have access to clergy who can administer pastoral care.Our goal is to raise $12,000 in order to meet our rent for 2016 which includes payment of rent as well as utilities. We invite you to prayerfully consider our need.We know with the hand of God and your support we can do this. Please show your love and support for: Help Us Pay Our Rent.How can I give to: Help Us Pay Our Rent.There are many ways you can give. 1) You can give to this project via this GoFundMe campaign 2) Direct donations into our bank account  visit our website www.ascensionorthodox.org for more details.If you have the heart to help but you do not have the funds please consider sharing this on your social media sites. If you need any further information concerning this request please feel free to contact us for more information  www.ascensionorthodox.org While all contributions are very welcome, please keep in mind that we are not a tax-deductible entity at the moment and therefore are unable to issue tax-deductible receipts.Why is this campaign important?Holy Ascension Mission is an important stepping stone towards establishing a permanent Orthodox Church in Melbourne worshipping in the English language.We kindly ask your assistance to help fund this venture and provide us with the necessary funds to meet our goal.This Mission inspires all who attend Holy Ascension to live beyond themselves.Thank you for your time and consideration of this worthy and God-pleasing project.May the Lord bless you!To learn more about us, please visit our website: www.ascensionorthodox.org

                        It is with great joy and humility that Cam and I are on this faith journey for such a time as this! Have you ever had a deep inner desire to do something that seemed so out of reach? Yet this voice on the inside kept whispering, It will happen. Well, the it will happen, is in its embryonic stage right now. And with the help of family, friends and other God directed people we are asking that you will be a part of our It will happen MIRACLE!Unwarranted circumstances have a way of putting our life into a better perspective.Good Friday this year I un-expectantly loss my job but I had such peace with it all. The only words that kept coming to me was, God's timing is perfect timing. I believed that God had another plan, but Lord what could it be? Little did Cam and I realize that in the midst of our storm there would be so great an opportunity and the desires of our hearts to be fulfilled? While we were trying to figure out, God was already working it out His way.

When we were asked to go on this mission trip to Swaziland, Africa for 2 weeks in July, we knew in our hearts this was a God assignment. In the past we have been asked but this time it was different. This time there was a strong pulling that we could not explain but we knew it was greater than either of us. The most humbling moment came when I was asked not only to go but to minister at the 2 day Womens Conference. We serve an awesome God! So despite what it looked like and the cost with me not having a job, we fasted and prayed and our answer came. We said yes! to the call and are walking by faith (actually we are leaping by faith) to be a part of this God given dream, that we have had for a long time.As we walk in what God has called us to, we realize that this task is monumental in our faith development. We have embraced the challenge and began moving on His word alone. We also realize we are going to need help along the way. Above everything, we want you to be praying with and for us as we begin this journey. We also want you to askGod how you can help us achieve our goalby being a sponsorfor this mission trip. WhateverGod lays on your heart to bless us with, we will be forever grateful. Please know this is not about us, but its about offering the gift of salvation and encouraging new believers to trust in Jesus Christ. Our hearts are tender and ready to do what we feel God has called us to do at this time in our lives. Most importantly, we ask that you will pray with us through this entire process. We know nothing is impossible with God! So with expectation of what God is about to do, we ask that you be a part of this MIRACLE!We love you and thank you in advance for your kindness! God bless you ALL beyond measure.With Sincere Gratitude,Cameron and Gwin Minter

                        After nearly 8 years as faithful tenants in our current location, (and after extensive, costly renovations to make the rental property inhabitable) our small Orthodox Christian mission, All Saints of America , was unexpectedly given notice last week (9/14/16) to vacate the property by October 31. Although small in number, our dedicated parishioners have been saving steadily to purchase property for a permanent church location, but with this imposed and sudden deadline of only 6 weeks, we are now facing unanticipated costs on an already tight budget.As we likely will not be able to find, purchase, close on, and renovate a property for services within 6 weeks, we will need capital to fund these expenses (among others): moving supplies storage for church materials temporary space for services while we continue our search renovations to ready a space for services misc costs to sustain our parish during this transition increased adjustment in rent and/or down payment & mortgageAlthough events of this past week have been unexpected to say the least, we remain certain that Gods hand is guiding us through this change. We are asking our families, friends, and sister churches to help our mission continue to serve His will through a financial donation of any amount. ALL DONATIONS  100% - will go directly to All Saints of America Orthodox Mission in Alexandria, VA. Thank you so much for your help!

                        Unlimited Thought Life Enrichment Center is a metaphysical center and bookstore which opened its doors for business in September of 1987. For the past 28 years, we have been dedicated to the expansion of consciousness and helping ease our collective transition to a love-based society. Unlimited Thought was quite successful as a business up until Sept. 11, 2001 when the planes struck the world trade center. Shortly thereafter we experienced a significant decline in sales from which we have still not fully recovered. That event was intended to strike fear in the hearts of Americans and bring down those that were in service for the good of all. Well, Unlimited Thought has been hanging in there since then, but we are now humbly asking for your help. We are in need of assistance for paying this month's and last months rent, and the 1st of September is coming quickly upon us. Anything that you can donate will be greatly appreciated and you have our thanks in advance for ensuring our continued success in the expansion of consciousness.-Namaste*Donations to Unlimited Thought are not tax-deductable

Defend Catholic Parish Education!,"$2,810 ","$50,000 ",Faith," April 9, 2016",52,5,NEWRY,PA,907000,3,,"






                            Allen Zeth
                            
                                                            on behalf of St. Patrick School

NEWRY, PA                                




Please Save Our Catholic School!St Patrick School in Newry, PA, one of the oldest Catholic elementary schools in central Pennsylvania, is under threat. Our diocese, faced with grave financial and legal troubles, has ordered St Patrick and four other parishes to close their beloved schools at the end of this year. In their place the diocese is planning a consolidated regional school on three sites in and around Altoona, PA.This would be a tragedy. St Patrick School is widely recognized as one of the best parochial elementaries in the region. Demand is steadily increasing among parents seeking a traditional and faith-based curriculum delivered in the loving environment of the parish community. Closing our school would be a betrayal of many generations of parishioners, whose uncountable contributions of time, labor, love and treasure created the outstanding school we have today.  Closing St Patrick would also extinguish the last kindergarten-through-eighth-grade option left in area. Many parents believe strongly in the small-class k-through-8 model, where older children are schooled with younger ones, childhood is preserved through puberty, and children take responsibility for one another across a large span of ages. Many studies suggest that isolating children in puberty from younger children may serve to shorten childhood. Our parish is brimming with energy, optimism, and community cohesion, reflecting our long history of overcoming adversity through faith and piety. St. Patrick Church began as a mission parish for Irish and German immigrants in the late 1700s through the efforts of Servant of God Prince Demetrius Gallitzin. It was formally established as a parish in 1816. In 1921, the parishioners built a school with attached convent to serve the community, which was then booming along with the rail industry in nearby Hollidaysburg and Altoona. The school burnt down in 1944 and was rebuilt and re-opened the following year by the parishioners themselves.

Despite the serious damage done by the sexual abuse scandals over the past four decades, Catholic schools are resurgent in America , thanks to their focus on moral instruction, academic rigor and personal discipline. While we understand why our diocese believes it must adopt a defensive posture and consolidate our schools, we believe it is time to expand, not contract, parish-based education, which is also in keeping with His Holiness Pope Franciss call for a ""healthy decentralization"" of church affairs. Parents at St Patrick School know there is no safer place for their children to be than in their own parish school. St. Patrick has petitioned the diocese to remain open as an alternative Catholic school. Our school is fully accredited and was recognized by the diocese as having the finest facilities among all the local elementaries. Our ability to stay open depends now both on our determination as parents and parishioners to stand firm in the face of crisis, and on the generosity of the Catholic community at large.Please support St. Patrick School as generously as you can! We are a tax exempt charity and donations are deductible.

We promote a family atmosphere so all students can succeed at their level of learning. At St. Patrick's there is a place for every student.At St. Patrick, fun is an integral part of the curriculum.St Patrick fosters Christian childhood all the way through eighth grade.

                        My name is Gene Binder. I have been the lead pastor at Cornerstone Boulder for over 22 years. 12 years ago God gave me an incredible insight into how the ancient Israelites of the Bible are a foreshadow for his plan to build an eternal family. Through the story of the Jewish people emerges an even bigger story that spans the entire course of history and beyond. I have been working on capturing God's heart in this subject ever since and believe the time is right to move forward with a book.I recently gave a series of 10 messages at Cornerstone called Foreshadows and those of you who have seen and heard these messages know how powerful and inspiring this teaching really is. You can watch a sampling of one Foreshadows video or the entire series at the link below.FORESHADOWS VIDEO SERIES I am in the process of converting the Foreshadows teaching series into a book by using a professional writing team . I am hoping to raise $16,000 which will be used to transcribe all 10 videos and to complete the writing of the book. This is really a huge part of my life's work and I'm excited to see it come to fruition. Please consider helping me reach my goal. Your partnership means a lot to me and together we can get this important material out to the world.

                        Continuing the Loaves and Fishes Miracle...Dear Friends,Many of you reading this will know of the Children's Mission of Leonidas Plaza, Bahia de Caraquez, Ecuador and how every year we fund raise for the upcoming children's Christmas party. This year has been a particularly challenging time for the mission since the 7.8 earthquake of April 16, 2016 left Bahia de Caraquez and its people struggling for survival and renewal. Fortunately the people are resilient and there is hope; however, many of the expats who supported the Christmas party last year are now without homes in Bahia and currently have returned to North America. With this in mind, we have decided to create a GoFundMe webpage so that those of you who have supported us in the past can continue the tradition from afar. We also welcome new supporters too!This year we estimate we will need to buy approximately 400 Christmas gifts and enough food for 500 people. We have set our target at $2,500 - 400 gifts @ $5 per gift ($2,000) plus $500 for food and supplies.Last year many people donated their time, talents, and money. This year there are fewer of us in Bahia but we can achieve our objectives with your support. So while we would love to have you here to help, then if that's not possible please consider doing the next best thing by donating to this fund.If you would like to read more about the Children's Mission, you can find us on FaceBook. The name of the public group page is:Children mission of Leonadas Plaza, BahiaThere you will find reports from last year's Christmas party and our Loaves and Fishes Miracle :) as well as our continuing efforts to feed the children.Thank you in advance for your kind donations. Also, please consider making an early donation so we can make more effective purchases and support local merchants.This year's Children's Christmas Party will be held on December 17th., 2016. Please pray for the children and their families...

                        For the last five years, my wife and I have intentionally given our young children an unforgettable experience (spending quality time with them, and creating positive winter memories).But this year will be a little different. 
I won't be around for the beginning of the Christmas Break to spend time with my family.
No. I'm not leaving my family, but with my wife & children's blessing I am going to attempt to do something I have never done before! I'm going tomake myself homeless for a few days starting the evening of December 22nd-25th (and journal, record, and blog about my experience on this site)! Why? Because my wife and I care and have worked with the homeless population in this city for eight years, I (Terence) have experienced homelessness in my younger years, and we both want to do all we can to help resource people working with this population and raise awareness about the epidemic in this city (Atlanta). Also, a person I have befriended (Kurt) challenged me to do it. He stays here (in the picture):He shared with me that he'd rather stay here because some of the shelters close by are overcrowded with a few urinals and showers. He also said, it's very uncomfortable to get a good night's rest. So, he has chosen to stay on the streets (literally).I asked him, ""Why don't you just at least get off the streets and stay in the shelter?"" and he stated, ""I bet you will not live in those shelters for one night without coming to stay with me:""I took him up on his offer:I'm going to sleep in shelters, beg for money, try to find food, sleep on the streets, and build relationships with more homeless people to get a full understanding of the shoes they have to wear (for four days:all the way up to Christmas morning). I will miss my family, but will be back to see my children's faces early Christmas morning. I am going to take one pair of clothes, a friend (Travis Lamb), and my laptop. That's it: ""nothing"" else!
I'm not doing this to pat myself on the back,
 but to gain an experience to be able to advocate about the pros & cons of this epidemic in Atlanta. I want to see #lovebeyondwalls grow to impact the lives of ""vulnerable people"" not only in this city, but around the country. People are hurting, and I believe God needs people taking God's love and the power of the gospel to those who are hurting.I need your help launching this organization starting in January 1, 2014.

                        So here I am at the VA today Dona is down at her appointment and I decide to go upstairs in the Cafeteria and wait for here to finish her therapy. I am sitting at a table in the corner and I am listening to conversations around me and checking my cell phone for returned messages and I hear the cashier laughing I look up and see she is speaking with a VA Police Officer. I am smiling because it always nice to hear laughter especially in a hospital, just then VA Officer catches my gaze and smiles and comes over and asks can he join me. My reply is of course. I asked him how his day was going and he said great it had been a slow week for him at the Hospital. I said wow what makes someone decide to be a VA Police officer being a cop is hard enough but working at an active VA Hospital you never really know what could happen. He smiled and said I love my job I am an Ex-Marine I served for 2 full terms after Desert Storm... I cant imagine doing anything else with my life. It takes a veteran to understand a veteran, those of us who have served during times of war have learned to read the energy in a room or environment we just have a different view of things, so if I can help my fellow man, Veteran or not that is my purpose. I said what a great way to feel about what you do You should do what you love so you can love what you do. It gives you passion and great perspective... We talked for a few more minutes then he asked me what tribe I was from, I said I am Lakota His response was what are you doing here shouldnt you be in North Dakota at the Sacred Stone Camp or New York at the UN supporting your people. I smiled and said I am planning on going but like all things it takes time and money to be able to travel such a long distance... His chuckled and said you should do a go fund me, we just did one for a friend of ours so he could go up to New York and be there to support the tribes at the UN for yesterday and today.. He said: You would be surprised how many people would be willing to help. Just give it a shot and leave it to spirit.. What words of wisdom from a complete stranger, how truly grand is spirit to have put where I was so that he and I could speak.. It was truly refreshing and motivating speaking with him. Dona and I have been speaking of my journey for more than a week now. My excuse: If I am to go then I am sure spirit will find a way to help me get there. Well my little conversation today has moved me to start the ball rolling.I will use the vehicle as my home base. I will be bringing many supplies for others with me as well.  Part of the cost I am figuring in is for food supplies for others as there are now more than 8000 people in attendance. 100 lb bags of rice, flour, beans, dried meats, potatoes, onions and drinking water.I will be leaving on October 12th 2016

May God grant you peace, and bless you generously, as you have blessed us - however He may use this! To request help is not something we do easily, and we wouldn't have considered this had it not been recommended to ease our plight. We've been blessed to be supported by loyal patrons, friends, and family and are humbled that they consider this request worthy to promote.We are Sandy Easter-Graham, and Denise Easter-Kramer and we ownEaster's Catholic Books and Gifts. It is a small, family-owned, retail business located in Northern California, the Sacramento area. We opened our brick and mortar store in 1998, after having spent 5 years selling books out of our cars. Many years of work in the secular world left us empty and unfulfilled. In 1990 through the prayers of our parents, and sister, Kathy, we both found our way home to the faith of our youth and developed a greatdesire to spread the truth of the Catholic faith. It was the peace, and joy that wasfound there that set our hearts on fire to offer ourselves as laborers for the harvest. Our dreams were realizedby sharing whatwe'd foundin the works of the great writers of the past, the Fathers and Doctors of Christianity, the Saints, and also the many contemporaryauthors who had been schooled in the same. More importantly, itallows us to share the love of Christ with anyone who experiences that same emptiness after setting their sights on the world's pleasures and .finding that thosecan't satisfy.This store, more than a retail business is about the journey of life, the journey of the soul.It didn't occur to us the depth of service to our community, the many and diverse ways we'd be called to be his hands and feet. I offer you a reflection-one week's activity that we presented on our Facebook page a few years ago.      As we begin a new week this is what's on our minds, this past week at Easter's we have --   ...given countless instructions on the saints, their names and history;   ...connected two children, one a newborn, who desperately need a loving family, with a family who hope to adopt;    ...comforted a newly baptized Catholic trying to comprehend ""trust in God"" as she wept over her lost job and faced the fear of losing 16 years tenure, including health care and retirement;  ...attempted to console two separate individuals whose long-time marriages are falling apart, both of these have multiple children  ...one split maybe because life had become monotonous;  ...the other, sadly, because of an addiction to pornography;  ...delivered a rosary book to a dear 90 year-old man who got lost on his way to our store;  ...encouraged and calmed the fears of a returning Catholic as she recounted the life of her late son and introduced her to something in the Catechism she'd never heard - indeed suicide is ""gravely contrary"" to love but we ""should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives.

This gown had been purchased by a woman who was not blessed to have children and wanted to provide for exactly this type of situation;  ...rejoiced with a grandmother as she shared the picture of her precious new granddaughter, her only grandchild, made even more precious because this little one's big brother passed away just one year ago;  ...were blessed by the visit of hundreds to our store and tried to greet each one with a smile;  ...lost countless sales to Amazon and apologized to potential customers scores of times for not having exactly what is available on the web, explaining to them why it's important to support local business to enliven the local economy, boost local employment, and reinforce the values that Catholics hold dear;  ...answered the calls of numerous vendors who are waiting patiently for money;  ...completely missed 3 marketing opportunities;  ...created nine purchase orders for product that we needed four weeks ago;  ...supported a parish event, promoted one diocesan event and two other parish events;  ...received 193 new items into stock;  ...placed 27 special orders but failed to find time to place 14 more special orders, (those will have to get done tomorrow);  ...prayed every morning for those who enter the store, for our vendors and all those on our prayer lists and in our hearts and thanked God for the gift of this apostolate;  ...and finally we thanked God countless times for all those who support this small business, who pray for us,  ....and who share this so that others will appreciate other small business around the country.In addition to the everyday duties described we've been honoredto providethe venue for many important and inspiring events inthe Sacramento area.

Founder of Daughters of Mary, Mother of Israels Hope -Jerry Usher, Author and Founder of Vocation Boom-Dr. Ray Guarendi,Clinical Psychologist, Author, RadioHostHit very hard by the ""online buying craze"", this small business was supported by friends, and encouraged in 2011 toestablish a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization,Easter's Faith Formation Center (EFFC).I've included information about this non-profit at the end of this blog.So, why do we need this help?In January of 2016 the building we wererenting sold.After many months we've relocated to Citrus Heights, about 5 miles from our old location. We began the move Memorial Day weekend May 27, expecting to reopen the store June 1. A previous move in 2007 had been done over a 3-day weekend.It is now July 9, and we are still not approved to reopen our store. Unable to request an inspection for our license until all items were permanently placed and attachinga detailed floor plan (3 copies to city 3 copies to fire marshall) requested by the city, we've now been notified this spot is not zoned retail. Here arepictures of the center. The last picture is our spot.Our spot: 6916 Sunrise Blvd. Suite I, Citrus Heights, CA 95610The city hasgiven no assistance or shown no interest to see the issue resolved. Of course, the property owner is now involved. But we have no idea and no expected open date at this time. This small business relies on daily sales to pay overhead. That includes utilities, inventory, business debt, and employee payroll. Our staff once numbering 8, have now dwindled to volunteers, (we are grateful) and 4 paid. During this move the paid employes have also donated most of their time. Obviously, maintaining the non-profit EFFC, the storeprovides over 80% of the income for that non-profit, and the overhead for the store these weeks without incomehave drained our resources. In addition, we need signage, and funds for important advertising with Catholic radio and local parishes, computer upgrades, and website upgrades -Easter's Catholic Books Website if it be the Father's Will. We fear the end of this small familybusiness, and our worklifting up the Body of Christ,will be soonif we are unable to raise the funds to carry us through until the city deems us worthy of the necessary documents. Your generosity will allow us to continue our classes and the service to the community. You'll be supporting a small business, and small business was once considered the backbone of the country. We work hard to live up to this important mission. Your contribution in any amount will be used responsibly, mayGod be glorified by its use. Our daily prayers include all those who pray for us, who have patronized us, and who enter the store. You will be included in those daily prayers and Masses. Trusting, we arefilled with joy anticipating how God willbe glorified through these events.Our trust is in the Lord, and ""we know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose."" Romans 8:28May God grant you peace, and bless you generously, as you have blessed us!EASTER'S FAITH FORMATION CENTEREaster's Faith Formation Center,EFFC, supports the development of catechesis in the Diocese of Sacramento, promotes the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and provides an academic and spiritual environment that engenders putting on the mind and heart of Christ.The classes are always free, we do encourage donations but do not want anyone left out. So, weve had the privilege of reaching hundreds of students from all walks of life, ranging in age from 16 to 89. Some were catechists or catechists-in-training; most had no formal experience with philosophy or theology. So, while the instructors often use undergraduate to graduate material, they do so in a way that assures understanding, regardless of background.It also serves as vehicle for the buliding up of the Body of Christ, for those who just want more. We discuss Church History, Christian doctrine, ethics, the virtues, literature, end-of-life issues and more. A great explanation of the EFFC - Friends seeking to ignite the action of the Holy Spirit within ourselves and our communities by exploring, analyzing, and reflecting upon the Truth.The EFFC isjust another avenue for us to build up the community we serve.A partial list of our instructors and presenters:Diocese of Sacramento Auxiliary Bishop Myron J.

We are starting something new and we want your input on this. During our almost 8 years of traveling and ministering in song in churches all over the United States and Canada we have been blessed to meet some great people and see a lot of amazing places. God has blessed and we are honored to do what he's called us to do.There have been times when a church has had to cancel an event we were scheduled to appear at which left us with no income. Some of you may not know that we almost always go to churches to sing on a love offering basis only. We have no other income but the offerings and the Cd's we sell at our concerts. When a date is cancelled there is no income for us which means well you know what it means!We have started something called ""One Buck A Month Club"" and you can be a part of the club. We are asking you to help us make up for lost income by pledging to give just $1.00 a month to our ministry. That's less than one soft drinkorone cup of coffee a month! This will help offset any cancellation we may have in the future and help us pay our bills and expenses.We will send you an email notice at the beginning of each month with a link to send your pledge in by credit or debit card. If you'd like to send more then we would certainly accept whatever you feel you need to give. If it's $5.00 or more a month we will send you a free CD every time a new one comes out as long as you are pledging. Please be in prayer and ask The Lord what he would have you to do. We appreciate your financial support and prayers. We hope to hear back from you and see you real soon at one of our services.Blessings,Bobby, Becky, Grace, Landis, Hope, Faith & Justis

                        #ALLCHRISTIANLIVESMATTERTHE STORYBishop Abrams was a prominent pastor in Detroit for over 12 years. She had served in many clergy organizations and taught ministers at the seminary. Bishop Abrams resigned from her pastorate in Detroit, MI in October 2013 due to her disclosing to the church that she was in a same gender marriage. Her church was split over her remaining the pastor after her honesty about her marriage. Bishop Abrams understood the importance of marriage equality and travelled to Iowa to wed her best friend earlier in the year (March 2013). Bishop Abrams received much discrimination in her community after disclosing her sexual orientation and was not welcomed in many clergy/denominational organizations. Bishop Abrams experienced an attempt by many in the Christian community todisgrace her via many websites, blogs, papers, sermons, and Bible studies with anti-gay messages and homophobic rhetoric. Bishop Abrams experienced threats by right wing evangelicals and conservatives and thus left Michigan to march on with the ""call"" that God placed upon her life after 15 years of ministry in Michigan. THE HOPE#ALLCHRISTIANLIVESMATTERHope is the only thing that has kept Bishop Abrams going. She has pressed towards the mark of the higher calling and found it by opening Empowerment Liberation Cathedral 2 years ago.Bishop Allyson Nelson Abrams is raising money to continue the vision that God has given her to preach, teach, pastor, and encourage ALL people.

I have been given a once in a lifetime opportunity to study ""Apostle Paul's Footsteps"" in Greece, to be taught by Christine Caine, and learn from one of the leading non-profits A21 combatting human trafficking, slavery and currently working with the refugees from ISIS. This is an opportunity that for the first time in 10 yrs of missions I can spend 2 weeks studying the Word, gleaning from world leaders and organizations. Then I'll be able to spend the next month in Europe gaining insight and hands on information of how organizations are fighting injustice around the world in the No. 1 ranked area(s) for human trafficking.I currently need $4,320 by Septemer 19, 2016, for the study expenses and am raising more to sustain the travel into and from countries and organizations as I am exposed to the injustices facing Europe and the Middle East today.The trip is two-fold, to learn and glean insght, strategize with world leaders today, and to go and continue releasing the love, hope, and justice of Jesus to those vulnerable and at risk. I know this is a quick window of time and an opprotuntiny I couldn't pass up. Will you join me to learn and to grow? I am willing to go. Thank you forpartnering with me as I continue to see the world restored and set free!Thank you again, for sowing into me, my dreams, my education, and the precious lives I am sent to.

As many know Naylien has a love and passion for singing. It has always been her dream to travel the world doing what she loves. Little did we know that God has a purpose in her life bigger than we can imagine. 
This week she was given the opportunity of a lifetime to travel with Eddie James Ministries. It was very difficult seeing her go but I am happy that she will be having an awesome experience. 
So the purpose of this GoFundMe is the ministry will be traveling next month to Germany and Israel and she has not been with them long enough to get sponsored so we need fund raise for her trip so we need to get together and help for her to be able to experience this amazing opportunity.
Anything is greatly appreciated .. Love you all!

BROOKLYN, NY                                





                        Greeting Friends and Family!!!I am so honored, excited, and ready to walk in my purpose. I give thanks to our Creator for allowing me to tap into my higher consciousness of self and directly connect me to my purpose in this existence. For those of you unaware, I have been called to take on the role of priestess in the Akan tradition (indigenous African culture among several west African countries often associated to Ghana). In order to complete this part of my journey, further my studies and expand my practices, I will be traveling overseas to Ghana to be a trained and graduated priestess to Nana Adade Kofi, an esteemed deity of the Akan spiritual tradition. Nana Adade Kofi is a male Bosom of strength and perseverance and is from the Guan area of Ghana. Nana Adade Kofi's sword is used to swear oaths of allegiance. He is the Abosom of iron, metals and is a warrior. I have always had a spiritual inclination and a heightened sensitivity to things of a spiritual nature, yet, I have never fully explored this side of myself nor have I truly valued it appropriately. This ability has only heightened after becoming a mother. I found that societal sentiment supported me in disregarding the ability to tap into the spiritual aspect of my conscious mind (which we all possess as extensions of the Creator). This changed when I met my spiritual family who allowed and supported me to connect to my gift of connecting to spirit. For four years my family serviced me spiritually and taught me even more about humility, perseverance, observance, and the importance of seeking and giving truth. These were the beginning steps toward becoming my most complete and best self along with serving my purpose in my lifetime. This has allowed me to find inner peace and self-assurance. This four year journey of learning a new culture and adjusting to my new way of being was a great challenge. For my spiritual strengthening I was unable to indulge in many of my prior ways of living (i.e. change in my attire, discontinuing the practice of applying makeup, or wearing jewelry) among other changes that were specifically named for me personally. The goal was to achieve discipline created by a very simple way of living. This truly humbled me and detached me from living in excess as I have done. Now I am more clear in my purpose for this physical life. My purpose is to use my light as vehicle for healing, empowering and transforming the lives of all women across the globe. In knowing where you are going you must know where you came from, whether you want to follow the footsteps of those who came before you or not. Ancestral Veneration is a large part of the spiritual work I am involved in. When we give honor and respect our ancestors we uplift them and ourselves in the process. Because we acknowledge and honor them, our ancestors can give unparalleled insight into who and what we are. As I have been fortunate enough to receive the privilege of being serviced by my spiritual family, through the connection of my ancestral lineage, I feel it is my responsibility to share the services among my community members. Creating the accessibility for others to gain self awareness and knowledge of self purpose will be most rewarding and merited for an, otherwise, ostracized group of people in America. Theres not a better time than now for people of color, especially, to find balance and salvation in connecting to their purpose and serving as examples to the loved ones that surround them. Honing in on self, finding purpose, or knowing where to seek the assistance toward that sacred and necessary process of being whole can pose as quite a challenge when constantly inundated by various media sources that do not serve in a positive manner. If fact, it serves as a great distraction from being in tuned and creating insight within ourselves. It is my duty to fulfill others by helping with the daily challenges they face including emotional turmoil and loss.  If any of you know me you know that I dont like to ask for much, especially money during a financially challenging time in our world. I would prefer to be the one doing the giving. I do want you to keep in mind the wealth of knowledge I will inherit during my time studying in Ghana to employ upon my return to help serve my community. I am asking for a total of $8,000 USD my goal is to raise this money by September 2016.

Ashley's IJM Internship - S. Asia,"$12,048 ","$15,000 ",Faith," May 4, 2016",96,4,GREENCASTLE,PA,428000,,11,"






                            Ashley Burkett
                            
                            
                                                           
GREENCASTLE, PA                                






In Mayof 2014, I traveled with a group of students from Messiah College to Southeast Asia. My passion for social justice issues and advocacy work, already ignited by my knowledge and involvement with organizations in the United States, only deepened following my experience abroad. My specific focus onhuman trafficking led to adesire to serve in the field with individuals fighting human trafficking in countries around the world. For the first week of my journey to Southeast Asia, we stayed in a hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, overlooking a district of the city known as the Brickfields, or ""Little India."" Within a few hours of our arrival, it became known to us that the Brickfields contained parts of the ""red light"" district of Kuala Lumpur. Red light districts are areas where (legal or illegal) prostitution, sex-related services, and human trafficking are rampant. I recall eating lunch on the edge of the district, at the Husen Cafe, studying a dilapidated hotel, my heart sinking, realizing that the hotel clearly offered more than room and board services. While in Malaysia, I listened to harrowing stories shared by new acquaintances of when they were approached by kidnappers who walked straight into their school and attempted to abduct them. With absolute horror, it was confirmed that it was a frequent occurrence for children to be abducted directly from school. Later, I discoveredthat many of the children abducted from theschools are eventually sold into labor and sex trafficking.After witnessing human trafficking on a more visible, personal level, my heart felt called to open itself to the possibility of serving in a field that works to fight human trafficking. Upon my return to the U.S., I added a secondary undergraduate major that would enable me to understand the cultures and social structures of a variety of other countries, and began to further my education on human trafficking, as well as other human rights violations. In the fall of 2015, I attended an advocacy day in Washington, D.C. on behalf of International Justice Mission. While in Washington, D.C., an intern approached me, discussing the internship opportunities available with IJM and his own experience as an intern. Approaching the end of my first semester of my undergraduate senior year, the path that I had originally intended on pursuing began to unsettle me. After a series of events, I discovered an opportunity to apply as an intern with IJM. The decision to follow the call to apply (and accept a position) with International Justice Mission has not been an easy one, as it has changed my life direction, but with an enormous amount of prayer, faith, and the continued support of family, mentors, and friends, I have decided to intern with International Justice Mission.In May 2016, I will receive my B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Sociology and Anthropology from Messiah College. I have been offered a position with International Justice Mission in South Asia, working as a legal intern. The internship is entirely funded through my own personal funds, and from those who are willing to support me in this ministry.I will spend about a year abroad, beginning in September 2016, and will need around a total of $15,000-$21,000 for the year. The living expenses occur on a varied timeline, as I need about 50% of fundingprior to leaving for South Asiafor costs of airfare, housing, and other pre-departure necessities. My plan, however, is to raise as much as possible prior to departure so that I am financially secure while abroad. While abroad, I am in need of donations and monthly sponsors who will continue to support me spiritually and financially while I work without pay for International Justice Mission.Thank you all so much for your support. I am eternally grateful for anyone who contributes, whether it is through prayers or material means. I am blessed through you.-Ashley""I must be willing to give whatever it takes to do good to others. This requires that I be willing to give until it hurts. Otherwise, there is no true love in me, and I bring injustice, not peace, to those around me."" Mother Teresa

                        Hello! Brett Cox here.. AKA DJ Bubba LoveIf you know me...then you know I have helped people in need my whole life. I have spent the better part of the day on ZELLO dispatch with the CAJUN ARMY. Yes... I have volunteered my services to help in anyway I can in Baton Rouge Louisianan. I did my part to bring awareness to the water crises here in Florida... it is now up to the people to vote tomorrow. I will never stop working for clean water, but there are other issues at hand, and I want to help. I will spend this week dispatching Crews, supplies and taking requests for help by phone, from the now...Homeless.... in Baton Rouge. The Cajun Army is a very well rounded group of people that are all volunteers. Very professional on the airwaves as well. I have been fortunate in my life to have never had a real disaster effect me, But I know many who have. There are elderly and poverty stricken folks still living in there homes that black mold has set into. The streets are lined with demolition debris from the now useless homes. It is very hard to compose yourself in not letting your emotions show when speaking to some of these folks...Just heart breaking. I will be heading down to Baton Rouge to get my feet wet and hands dirty, for 3-4 days to start, hopefully by this coming Monday the 5th. Then return home to work for the weekend and repeat as much as I can weekly. I am lucky enough to have my days free during the week right now. On that note....I am not a rich man. I never ask for anything from anyone. But If you feel the need to help me get there and back for a few weeks, well... I am going to need it. There is no personal gain here, I promise., I have a GOFUNDME set up. I will need help with Gas, food, some apparell gear and lodging for around 3 weeks. Whatever money is used will be transparent in receipts. Anything left over will be donated to the immediate group that needs it at the Cajun Army. I encourage you to go to  http://thecajunarmy.com/ and volunteer to be an admin, or hands on in Baton Rouge. Admin consists of looking at spread sheets with names, numbers, and reasons for help. Then, calling those people and making sure you prioritize them correctly for response time. Obviously, Demo help is exactly what it says. there is cooking, computer work also. together we will get this done. It goes to show you what serve and love thy neighbor really means. Thank you in advance... Bubba Love

                        HI Everyone! As you all have heard I'm leaving the nest. I am so excited about this opportunity to get closer to God! So I'll see if I can explain exactly what it is I am so excited about. The training I will be attending is called YWAM, or Youth With A Mission. It's a Christian based training in Muizenburg, Capetown South Africa. I will be taking classes in Church Worship. Using the gift that God gave me to bring glory to His name.It will be for six months, the first three months will be the lecture phase. The second three months will be the outreach phase. I am not sure where the outreach will be. There is talk of Mauritius, Kenya or working with Syrian refuges in Greece. I will get to put everything I learned during the lecture phase in practical application. I will be boarding at the school. It's a two hour flight from Johannesburg, South Africa... Which is a five hour drive from Swaziland. Since living in Swaziland I have met many people from Capetown through friends of mine, so I have some connections already. I've made friends with my classmates on Facebook and Instagram. So we've all had a chance to find out a little bit about each other. Other young adults from all over the world will be attending with me. I look forward to getting to know all of them and becoming friends. So I'm calling on all the Prayer Warriors. Friends, Family and Loved Ones. I will need a Spiritual Support team as well as a Financial Support Team.The funds I am raising will cover all expenses for the six months I am gone including lecture phase, room and board, travel for outreach, and visas and stuff.Thanks for taking the time to read this.All my love,Katie

James' Buenos Aires IMC Video Trip,"$1,245 ","$2,500 ",Faith," September 13, 2016",17,12,OWOSSO,MI,84000,,5,"






                            James Edwards

Help send me to this international gathering of church leaders, where I'll create media to share their stories and work toconnect them with the US church.



En Espanyol 

This IMC Congress in Buenos Aires will bring together hundreds of pastors from around the globe. I will record individual interviews, Congress sessions, scenes all around the city, and the hosting church community. I wantto share the stories of these leaders to foster and support relationships with the American church. I think many in the US couldbea huge blessing to these distant groups, if they found a way to connect. I want to help take a step towards being the body of Christ across nations' borders.

ecumenical (ekymenk()l)adjective -promoting or relating to unity among the world's Christian churches

To try to actively engage (in addition to creating video to passively engage),there will be a closed groupon Facebook whereI will post daily video blogs, highlight quotes, and pictures from the IMC. I hope to have you make a social investment as well the financial investment for the media content. I will be giving FB access to any donation. Even for one single dollar.No amount is too small. Every bit helps!I will also be giving access to anyone who helps re-post/tweet/share the GoFundMe posts. Details coming later for that.My goal is to create a bigger context for myself and to share it as visibly and dynamically as possible.

The IMC (International Ministerial Congress) is a organization that aids the Church of God(7th Day) in coordinating its churches around the world. I will be working with Bryan Cleeton(GC Missions) and Heber Vega(CoG7 Northeast District, IMC Board), who are facilitating the event in Buenos Aires. Alongside them, I will be helping to show the who and the what of the IMC. And thereis rather a lot.There are over300,000 membersfrom nearly 60 countries. Yet, most in America are unaware of the activity or situation of these manyfellow believers.I want to encourage and promote taking real action and pay forward the countless blessings that we, in the US, take for granted. I believe we have a powerful opportunity to be the rewardof faith for our worse-off brothers and sisters across the planet.

I arrived at the amount of $2500 after booking flights and receiving input from several friends with vast travelexperienced. I'm definitely attempting to live modestly during the trip but the expenses are still substantial. Your donations will be covering the following: round trip international plane tickets(DTW to EZE), baggage+insurance, five nights lodging, ten meals (two each day), and the rewards you will receive for contributing!

You may be thinking, ""Shouldn't the IMC pay for these costs?"" After a long conversation with Bryan Cleeton, I choose to try and crowd-source as much as possible of my trip. The IMC spends a great sum of money on travel forpastors from very impoverished nations. So for the opportunity to create more awareness (by inviting you to invest) and to not force Bryan to choose between any third-world pastor and myself, I hope to raise the funds this way.



Thank you for your interest and support!James Edwards - Bio

SAINT AUGUSTINE, FL                                





                        What an opportunity! Recently we were approached by the owners of the Ponce Mall about what to do with the space, now deemed dead. We said, we would like to buy it. Why buy the mall? you might say. First of all, Anchor Faith Church believes in serving our community. Theres no better way to serve than to revitalize the mall. Our plan is to continue to lease to the existing stores and fill the empty space located on the east side toward US 1, while the church grows into the back spaces located on the west side toward Old Moultrie. A portion of the proceeds of all the leases will enable us to give back to our city, nation, and parts of the world for missions and outreach opportunities. Within some of the retail spaces we will operate incubator stores for beginning entrepreneurs. We will update the exterior to create an environment that will draw community events to be held on the property. For example, car shows, food truck venues, fundraiser events, and most importantly parking to help offset traffic with large events downtown. Secondly, as the church grows into its space, we will be able to assist more in meeting the physical needs found in our area. Such as, clothing, food, and furniture  a distribution center you could say. Not to mention the growth of ministry as a whole. One of which will include a classical Christian school; K  12 with athletics and arts programs. We are a local church, with local people, wanting to create jobs and invest back into St. Augustine. We invite you to join us in this opportunity to possess the Ponce de Leon Mall  where people are more important than profit. www.anchorfaith.com

                        We all know that to abandon a child right after birth is a crime. A mothers job is not done when she gives birth to a child. With birth, motherhood and nurturing takes on a much more important dimension. And so it is in the KINGDOM of GOD ... and the ministry of CHRIST FOR ALL NATIONS.We have TWO massive Gospel Campaigns coming up in the CONGO and we need to have 1.6 MILLION COPIES of our NOW THAT YOU ARE SAVED follow-up booklets printed in the French language to accommodate the huge harvest of souls anticipated for these two events.Up to now, in our evangelistic ministry, under the leadership of Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke and Evangelist Daniel Kolenda, we have printed well over 90 MILLION NOW THAT YOU ARE SAVED,booklets in 50 languages. Now we need 1.6 million French versions printed and shipped just as quickly as possible. We have $85,800 due in FEBRUARY 2016 and another $150,150 in the months following.In our massive campaigns, our job is NOT CONCLUDED with the Amen of the sinners prayer. But rather, thats where it all BEGINS. EACH ONE of our follow-up booklet costs ONLY 20 cents. That includes preparation, translations, printing and shipping to the crusade site. What a GREAT OPPORTUNITY! FRESH MILK from the Word for every New Born Babe in Christ  for 20 cents ... just 2 dimes apiece. IF EVERYONE could do SOMETHING ... SOMETHING GREAT would get done.Gods Word is clear: as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, (1. Peter 2:2)We cannot turn a new babe in Christ out into the desert and tell them to take care of themselves. How could never say to these new converts go and be blessed, but not give them food or the milk which will cause them to grow spiritually and be strong? Its a great responsibility.The booklets are shipped in advance to the crusade sites in 40-foot containers. Once they get into the hands of a convert, we know it is most likely read by the entire family, neighbors, and often the entire village.We often hear reports how many more people get saved by simply reading it. What a priceless, powerful tool for the Kingdom of God. Praise God -- The milk of Gods Word has no expiration date.Nothing can take its place.Please allow the Holy Spirit to speak to your heart now and help us plant Gods Word into the lives of a new-born children of God. Your TAX-DEDUCTIBLEgift will help impact hundreds of thousands of lives! Not only will you have our sincere thanks but these precious, new-born Christians as well.----------------------------------------The purpose of Christ for all Nations is to fulfill the great commission of Jesus Christ by taking the message of salvation to all peoples of the world. Christ for all Nations is primarily known for its crusades in Africa and other third world countries.

                        God called me to the ministry at the tender age of 13 years old in New Orleans, LA...I answered the call and began to do His work without delay. My heart's desire/passion has always been to reach this hurting generation and touch the lives of God's people with authencity and relevancy in ministry through spreading the Truth of His Word. Since age 15, God began to use me in a great way to touch the lives of young people just like myself...who grew up in poverty, surrounded by drugs, by showing them there is a reality in serving God boldy and seeking to serve Him over succumbing to the temptations to serve the streets. As a result of giving and devoting my entire youth to Christ, God began to open doors for me to minister to thousands of hurting people and spread the Love of Christ throughout New Orleans and Houston. He placed the right mentors/leaders in my path to help mold me for the ministry mandate God had given me for building His Kingdom. I was licensed and ordained to preach the Gospel in 2005/2006. Because I was serious about the call of God on my life and have a deep hunger for Him and sharpening the gift/anointing He's already placed on my life, I attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma for seminary school where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Theological Studies in 2010. After finishing my degree, God supernaturally opened the door for me to work in the banking industry...by His grace and favor! I excelled rapidly...reach several promotions...even to the point of being invited to work out of the Manhattan area for the past 3 years. While I've been able to climb the ladders of success in the bank via my ""career"", I know deep in my spirit this isn't my ""calling"" by God. Early this year, the Lord began to deal with my heart and spoke boldly to go back to Houston and ""Finish the Work I have Begun in You...There's a Need among the people"". I wrestled with this for quite some time, to be honest, because God knows that I financially support my mother (who's a single parent of 5) in Houston, TX...after suffering devastation from Hurricane Katrina, I relocated my Mother and siblings to Houston and was eventually able to help provide her the home of her dreams after we loss everything in New Orleans. I support her on an ongoing basis and have made that vow to God that she would lack for nothing as long as I live.Nevertheless, God has instructed me precisely to return back to Houston to serve His people with undivided attention in the capacity of full-time ministry...He told me to walk away from Corporate America and to go ""finish the work He has begun""...Anyone who knows me know I have always been a man of strong integrity and pureness of heart...by God's grace, He's placed an insane work ethic in me to have always been able to provide for my family and work hard without the need of any except Him. I'm blessed to say He has allowed me these past 5-10 years to be a strong support to my precious mother and family while still being able to support myself while living here in the Manhattan area.However, to start-up this church-plant ministry, it's going to take several thousands to secure a venue to meet on a weekly basis, provide musical equipment, cover the costs for the initial start-up and transition. We have secured a facility that will provide a state-of-the-art sound system, proper seating, and space to accommodate families with effective ministry and meet the needs wholistically. This will allow us to mitigate the costs for at least the first 2-3 months.We're looking to launch officially in October and move forward with the ministry's inception.I'm asking those who truly know my heart, my passion and love for reaching His people and ministering to the hurting wounds of so many who are lost and in need of a true/fresh experience of His Spirit, to stand with me as I obey His Great Commission and help meet the needs of His people.I will also provide every donor with an itemized break down of where every dollar went once funds are disbursed because I believe in always being a man of God who always carries transparency and integrity.Thank you in advance to all my family and close friends from near and far for your support...please keep me in deep prayer as we begin this unprecedented journey!May you receive God's greatest blessings in return for your support.-Vashawn

Summer Ministry Trip to California,$697 ,"$2,650 ",Faith," June 6, 2016",11,3,KELLER,TX,276000,,10,"






                            Allen Powers
                            
                            
                                                           
KELLER, TX                                





                        Help us impact lives through outreach and ministry training. This TripChristen and I are following God's calling to spend the summer at Bethel Church in Redding, California. This trip is all about being equipped to grow in new ways to impact lives with the gospel. The Lord asked us to come to Bethel and get immersed in the culture. While we are here we are involved in outreach and evangelism training. We have already seen several people come to the Lord, receive freedom, and healing during our time here. We are excited and gaining momentum for what is yet to come. The Dream...Christen and I are passionate about seeing a generation walking in their identity, living from God's presence, and expanding His Kingdom into every realm of society. When we come home...When we return to DFW we will be launching an outreach to college students in Fort Worth. The college ministry is focused on activating young people in supernatural ministry to see revival on campuses. Why College Campuses? The college years are such a crucial time in our lives. For many, it is the time when we find our life's calling or at the very least begin to be trained in our life's work. Our heart is to create a safe place for emerging leaders to step out and take risks, gain invaluable life and ministry experience, and solidify their identity in Christ to be all that God has called them to be. How you can help...1. Prayer..You can stand with us for favor, divine connections, lives to be changed, and that we would receive all the Lord has for us here. 2. Financial Partnership...We have already raised over half our summer budget. We are thankful for that. Now we need to be fully funded so we can focus completely on our assignment here in California..No gift is too small....Since we started this journey we have received donations ranging from $5 all the way up to $1,000. Every gift makes a difference in helping us reach our goal. If we all pull together and do what we can, the bigger goal becomes easy. Any amount will be greatly appreciated and helps us reach more people for the Kingdom.The Results...You are investing in souls for the kingdom of God, young leaders growing in their ministry, and helping us fulfill our Kingdom assignment here in California. The Benefits of Partnership 1. God promises to bring increase and provision to those who invest in the gospel. (2 Cor. 9:8, Phil 4:19) 2. God promises we will reap as we sow, so whatever you make happen for others He will make happen for you. Helping us in our assignment opens heaven's resources to you in powerful ways. (Galatians 6:1-8) 3. We promise....**To faithfully steward the funds you invest.**To provide updates weekly on our Facebook group for you to see and hear all we are involved in. **To pray for you and your family regularly. **To connect with each of you personally as the Holy Spirit leads.**To share all we receive here in California with you in whatever way we can, via social media, meetings, and relationship. **To partner with you in prayer and faith for you to step into all God has called you to in your life. Thank you for believing in us and standing with us as we see a generation advance God's Kingdom into all the world! God bless you!

Alex and Milena in a German DTS,"$6,535 ","$5,150 ",Faith," September 7, 2015",46,12,COLUMBUS,OH,482000,,13,"






                            Alexander Schaller
                            
                            
                                                           
COLUMBUS, OH                                





                        Our story - When I (Alex) was in Germany in January, leading a Discipleship Training School outreach team, God spoke nearly audibly to me. He told me that I was to come and help pioneer the first DTS at a new base in Bad Blankenburg, Germany. The voice was clear and the command simple - Go! After seeking prayer, counsel, and receiving confirmation, I decided to move forward into the command that I had received.This summer, Milena and I got married! Milena has had the desire to do a DTS for 5 years, but it has never worked out. We see this as a chance for her to do the school so that she can continue to work with YWAM. With this in mind, we submitted her documents for her visa but she was denied. After prayer, we felt like God was saying, ""Do you trust me?"". So we decided to apply again - and were once again rejected. Again the voice of God, ""Do you trust me?"". We prayed and sought advice from others and even looked into some other schools around the world - but everything always came back to ""Do you trust me?"". So with hearts afraid to hope, we applied one more time. And God opened doors! Milena received her visa for Germany.We have no doubts that God is calling us to Germany for the next three months and we would like to ask you to partner with us. The school will cost around $5,000 USD for 6 months (3 months of lectures and 3 months of outreach). I (Alex) will participate in the leadership team for the school, will teach the 3 month media journalism class that runs parallel to the school, and will lead an outreach team. Milena will be able to complete the DTS so that she can work with YWAM and help staff the DTS - our vision is to minister as a family! We will also serve together in the current refugee crisis.Thank you for your prayers and support!

                        My name is Laura and I am Jenny Mosier's sister. Mosthave knownthe struggle she and her family have had with cancer beginning in 2008. Eight years is a long time to have extra medical bills and expenses. We've all shown them love and lifted the burden emotionally and spiritually. I wouldlike to givetheir adoring fans the opportunity tolift the burden financially.Sometimes saving your life takes a toll on your living. For all the details, here is Jen's CaringBridge site:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jennymosier. Jen was able (and needed)to take the summer off after working in the school system, but as you can imagine, fighting cancer IS a full time job. Her newest medication leaves her drained for much of the month.She is hoping to join the work force soon, but hopefully part time. Matt took a new job (yay!) that is better for him and the family and closer, but alas,pays less for now. Add insurance gaps, medication, 3 kids that insist on eating,cost of living and voila!--an opportunity for YOU and ME to show our love.The money raised will go mainly towards medical costs (tests, visits, medication, deductible), but I also want them to feel free to use it towards other pressing costs like car repairs or school expenses for the kiddos.If Jen and her family have made you laugh or smile or roll your eyes or made you go hmmm, please consider giving any amount. I can attest to the fact that they will be so grateful. And I bet we will even get treated to more of Jen's loony but sincere writings. Whether you are able to give or not, THANK YOU.P.S. Another great way to help is by sharing this page!

Keep Raising Real Men on the Road,"$21,810 ",$23.10 ,Faith," March 18, 2015",371,18,SMITHFIELD,NC,2000,9,4,"






                            Melanie Young
                            
                            
                                                           
SMITHFIELD, NC                                




UPDATE BELOW (and corrected my typo) :-)

We're praying hard for God's provision. We're Hal & Melanie Young, the authors of Raising Real Men, Christian Small Publishers 2011 Book of the Year, parents of six sons and two little girls (from adults on down), and speakers who travel all over the country trying to help families make Biblical family life practical.

We're pulled over at a truck stop, hoping that letting the van cool a while will let us drive a little further.

We're about one third of the way into a 3500 mile speaking and ministry trip. We drive our personal van and it has been losing oil pressure whenever we slow down or idle, so we took it to a trusted mechanic that helped us a couple of years ago when another mechanic told us we needed a new engine. He fixed it then for just a few hundred dollars, but this time he said it has to have a new engine. We had spun a bearing, the engine was failing and could go at any minute.We're praying we can make it through the trip (even though this afternoon it doesn't look good for making it through the day) and back home before it fails, but even if we do, what then? We're only home nine days before we head out on the next trip. We're scheduled to be on the road for 10 and a half weeks from March to July (about 17 weeks).We drive a fifteen passenger van pulling a ten foot cargo trailer with our booth set up, books and resources for our booth, and camping supplies. Between conferences, we either tent camp or stay in Christian hospitality homes to save money.We travel like that, even though it is more expensive than the two of us flying to conferences, for a couple ofreasons: it allows us to stop and speak at churches and small groups along the way that couldn't afford to have us otherwise and most importantly, it allows us to bring our children along. We don't wantto lose our own children helping other people to raise theirs. 

Here's another picture of our boys helping people at our booth at the CHOIS Conference in Idaho.Without the van, we can't get to those conferences coming up (NDSHA in North Dakota, CHEF in Louisiana, SHEM in Missouri, NCHE in North Carolina, HEAV in Virginia, OCEANetwork in Oregon, HINTS in Charlotte, and Teach Them Diligently in Ohio, Georgia, and Texas)!We know God is faithful. That's how we got this van to start with. Our youngest was born with a life-threatening heart condition several years ago and spent weeks in and out of ICU...Remarkably, that was the year we wrote our book, by God's grace.Within a few months of getting our little one stabilized and the book written, we found out Hal had stage IV cancer. The tumor was behind his breastbone, where it couldn't be felt or seen and the cancer had spread everywhere - liver, spleen, lungs, everywhere.We were contracted to speak all over, weren't supposed to fly because Hal's immune system was too weak, and our old van, well, here's the incredible story...Click to listen to God's amazing provision. Now we need to see His provision again! We need help! We need at least a running 15 passenger van that has a towing package able to tow a loaded 10 foot cargo trailer. It's the start of our conference season and we just don't have the resources after making it through the winter.Here's whatwe are thinking:If the Lord provided... (amounts include transaction fees)$4158, we could have a used engine put in our current van, a 2002 Ford E350. That's a little risky, because it has a short warranty and the mechanic can't be sure of it's condition until he has it, so it might cost more for repair before it was usable.

$5921, we could put a re-manufactured engine in it. That's a better option. There's still risk, since the van has 320,000+miles on it with the original transmission, etc. It's getting pretty rattletrap. This is also the second engine we have put in this van since we got it 5 years ago.

UPDATE: When we got close to making the earlier goal, everyone urged us to increase it enough to buy a late model used van, saying that they didn't think putting another new engine in our old van was a good use of money.

We did some research and the cost to geta well-maintained 2012 Ford E350 van with 60,000 miles on it and pay the transaction fees would be $23,100. So, we've updated the goal. OF COURSE, we are incredibly thankful for all that God has already done in such an unbelievably short time and will use whatever He provides with thankfulness! If the Lord provided this, it it would make our lives so much less stressful! We've lost time with three breakdowns so far in this one trip.

If God provideda good bitmore money, we might be able to get an RV, so we wouldn't have to stay inhotels (We can't camp in tents when it's too cold and hospitality homes are not always available.) and making it easier to do school on the road, or even pay off the debt from the past few years of medical crises and more.

Please check out our website , our Facebook page , even listen to this workshop on raising sons to be godly men and see if the Lord would have you to help our family. We are so grateful for your prayers and help, friends. Thank you so much for your incredible giftsto our family. It means so much to all of us!Note: Any donations are not tax deductible since they are gifts to our family and personal gifts for the benefit of an individual are not tax deductible.

                        What is China Missions?In 2012, while in prayer, God spoke to me and said, ""Go to China."" With that word burning in my heart, I left my home in Indiana, family and friends, starting a work that I did not know what God had planned. That was 4 years ago. Today, my wife Ruth and I, are continuing the work God had called me to since that December evening in 2012. Currently, my wife and I pastor a church in a large province of China. Together, my wife and I establish churches (church planting), along with weekly bible study's, this work is growing in just a short time.China boasts of a nearly 2 billion population, out of that, 82.7% remain UNTOUCHED (never heard of Jesus Christ) with only 1.5% of that entire population having a nominal understanding of Christ. YOU can help change that. So, what can you do? 1. Pray for this ministry 2. Pray how God would have you help in distributing Bibles, tracts and Christian materials and 3. Pray that God puts whatever financial gift on your heart that you can help. The mission in China is large and the workers are few. So I pray God give you wisdom in whatever you donate and know that he will in turn bless you for your support, if not here on this earth, then in eternity when you stand before God and he asks you, ""What did YOU do for the kingdom?""Christopher and RuthI can be reached at my main email: christopher152@gmail.com

                        A mothers cry for help ! 
Normally I wouldn't ask for help or expose the troubles I am in but I am in desperate need! 
My name is Aurora and I am a single mother of 4 children. 
My abusive husband of 10 years abandoned our family 2 years ago, moving out of the country after actions were being taken for domestic violence and only weeks after my 43 year old mother passed away.After losing my mother to an unsolved cause of death and finally in a sense escaping my husband I have barely been getting by.My grandmother was  the last of my support system and she passed away this month last year.Along with the tragedy of losing 3 of the most important people to me I have been taking loss after loss. Evicted from my home, problems with child care, and now the fear of losing my ability to work leading to not being able to provide because my vehicle has recently and finally gave out on me. The transmission was blown. I broke down with all 4 children in the middle of the road. I didn't have any money to even be able to tow it to a friends house so that maybe I could be able to repair it if possible. My car was towed and junked. I am ""couch surfing"" after spending most of my money on cheap motels , with all of my 4 children. Now that my vehicle is gone , my only way of transportation to work is gone , I am terrified what the future holds. My job is in jeopardy. I am asking for help! Please! I am asking for genuine and urgent help. Anything and everything will help. I am so desperate I am willing to work off or even pay back a loan. I am at my deepest ends of survival. I have 3 young girls and a toddler son who are all looking up to me and depending on mommy. All I need is some help to make sure I can provide for my children. The help I am asking for is mainly to provide me with some form of transportation to be able to get to work.With this help and push I know I will be able to keep my job and keep me in the direction of working for a stable home for my children and I. Please again anything will help. Any kind of donation to help obtain a vehicle will do so much. Any form of donation , whether it be clothes , food or shelter is needed and most appreciated. Any help even if it's sharing my post will mean the most to my children and I in our crisis. Thank you so much and God bless!

                        We are a baby church plant in Brazil, and wehave a good problem!The problem is that the church is so awesome that it's growing faster than we expected. Pier49 was born only four years ago with four people in our living room and today we have more people coming to worship with usthan our building can handle. We have an average of300 people coming every sunday for our 5pm and 7pm worship services. That is awesome but, the problem is that our building only seats 100, and that's already a stretch.We have people siting on the floor, on the subwoofers, a bunch of people stand outside the door trying to peek inside,there is people everywhere. Thank God the church is growing. The Bible says that the growth of the church comes from the Lord and we're glad he is giving us tremendous growth, but we need more physical space to accomodate all the new comers. We gathered the leadership to talk about what to do and we felt like it is the time to grow right now. God wants us to grow, it's time to move forward, its time to enlarge the tent. Therefore we decided to put down the middle wall and double the size of the building. Please, prayerfully consider helping us with our building expansion. Come and be a part of what God is doing in Brazil.

A Year ago we went to Belize to a town called Chan-Chen. We raised over 10,000 to build a church there and help feed and cloth children and parents in this town. We went there and were able to impact hundreds of people with the help of everyone here in the states.
On october 1, 2016 we will be going to Belize again back to chan- chen to continue the work we started there..The children and families need our help..We are very fortunate to live in the United States even if we are not rich or even middle class we have alot more then they do in this country. Belize is a very poor country with high levels of poverty especially in these little towns where there are no stores or franchise in any part of the country. God has put in our hearts to continue to help them as alot of people go and help but little return and continue to bring a little hope of sunshine for them.. A backpack or 10 cent cup of soup or even a dollar pair of slippers from Walmart will bring a huge smile on there faces...this is priceless. I ask each and everyone of you reading this to PLEASE help us help them..Please help us make this trip a success and reach as many Children and Families with The Word of God and with as many Materials we can buy to give them.
MATHEW 25:35,36 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.
Thank you May God Bless us All...

                        I have been serving with Eagles' Wings as a volunteer since 2014, and recently joined full time on staff based out of Clarence, NY. I have been given the amazing opportunity to travel with Bishop Robert Stearns and the rest of the Eagles' Wings on the Watchmen on the Wall Pilgrimage to Israel this September 26-October 9.While I am there, I will be serving in a variety of ways including assisting in the production and logistics team for the global Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem, broadcast LIVE on GODTV all around the world. I will also have a chance to serve at the Eagles Wings feeding centers, and be part of ministering throughout the land with Bishop Robert and the team.This will be my first time ever traveling overseas, and I am so excited that it will be to Israel! I have wanted to go my whole life and couldn't think of a better time or group to go with and to minister in the Land of the Bible.Eagles Wings is assisting me with a portion of the cost of this trip, and I have been able to raise some more, but I still need to raise $2,500 to see this ministry opportunity become a reality.Would you be a part of this upcoming ministry trip to Israel through a gift of $50, $100, or $250 towards the remaining $2,500 cost for this trip. Thank you for helping make this vision a reality.

                        I spent a life changing week serving the people of Port-au-Prince and Cite Soleil, Haiti in February through Mission Discovery. My heart was stretched, broken, and pieced back together in a way that I never thought possible. Still facing thedevastation of the 2010 earthquake and against almost insurmountable odds, every single person I met in Haiti has a profound hope for themselves, their families, and their country. Their hope is incredibly contagious, and every bit of it has rubbed off onto me. I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to return to the country I have completely fallen in love with this fall. Again, I have the chance to serve people, especially young children and orphans, through Mission Discovery. Please consider making a contribution towards my return trip to Haiti. Every dollar given will allow me to serve people in need!

Hi everyone! Thanks so much for your time of checking this out. Your support in this mission means the world to me!Ihave been led to go on my FIRST Missions Trip with my church Victory World Church for our Young Adult Ministry called Fusion! This Mission Trip is to Dublin, Ireland where I will be mentoring and counseling teenagers from the age of 12 to 18 at a camp called Pulse 2016 from July 22-31st.This trip means so much to me for I am finally ready to step off the boat and join in the fight for the Kingdom! My journey will start with showing God's children the love of their Heavenly Father and increasing their knowledge of the word. I'm ready to do some very important things that God has asked us all to do. One of these things are to lead the younger generation to him because children are a very important and valuable part of God's Kingdom. So I need your help to raise $1800.00 so that I will be able to go andhelp God's children in their mission to reach him and to change the lives of others surrounding them. All of the proceeds will go to towards travel expenses, hotel accomadations, and food. I will forever be greatful for whatever help you can provide. Thank you all in advance for this growing process in my life and for choosing to be apart of something amazing! May God bless you all to be givers for his works.

                        Our car is on it's last wheel but even more importantly it will not accommodate our growing family...A new mom to be has joined our family and is due October 20th.That will bring us to 7 people in the house and with our ministry assisant that is 8. Surprisingly, there are only a few models that have 8 passenger seatsthat are not ina caravan class (Higher taxes and different class drivers license.) We are looking at theVW Touran or something comparable. We have found several on the european auto sales sites and we believe we can find something to meet our need for about $10,000 which will include a sticker price of about 6,100 Euro ($6,900), all import & emission taxes, registration and the first year of insurance.This seems so much for me to ask for as we have yet to meet our monthly budget with three families in our home. However,I know with God all things are possible and He will provide for our needs...AND HE HAS!!!!We are traveling to Austria and/or Germany this weekend to make a purchase with whatever comes in by the 15th.  Thanks you all for your generosity.

The funds will go for certifications, specifically: Wilderness EMT, Leave No Trace Master Educator, Swift water Rescue Level 4, CPR Instructor, Canoe/Kayaking Instructor, and Wilderness Starguard.I have finished one year at the seminary and I have decided that I want to combine my two passions. I want to be able to offer trips, mainly outdoors doing some sort of adventure activity, and the ministry. The trip would provide people with a time to retreat from the world, experience God's Creation, and focus on what his word has to say.I cannot begin to describe to you how much I want to put into this endeavour. I can use any donation; if a dollar is all you have to spare that is generous.I would like to be able to thank each person who contributes. If you can procide me with an address, I will send you a hand written thank you. If you would like to be kept up-to-date on how everything is going, just ask and I will let you know any and everything you would like to know.Thank you for considering funding my dream!

                        Ingemann Danish Church has been a staple of our community since 1884. Our church is part of The National Register of Historic Places. Unfortunate events, including several bouts of vandalism, have caused us to close its doors and discuss what should be become of this place we love so much. After much discussion we have decided that a security system needs to be in place to deter future acts of vandalism. With the money raised we can repair the broken windows, restore the alter and ensure the safety of this tourist site that so many travel from afar to see. The sooner we receive help and funds from the community, the sooner we can share it with all of you. We will be so grateful for any monetary donations we receive. Thank you and God Bless. Monetary donations can also be made out to Ingemann and mailed to:Bethesda Lutheran Church703 Pine Street Moorhead, Iowa 51558

Catholic Philadelphia Outreach is a charity organization seeking to bring needed clothing, appliances, and basic necessities to the poorest in Philadelphia. We are in need of funds to provide used small appliances, furniture,clothing, and toys to those living in deep poverty. We will also be doing food drives and holiday events.

Philadelphia is number 1 for large cities in the United States with people living in deep poverty. Currently approximately 160,000 people are living in this condition in Philadelphia.

Deep poverty is defined as living at 50% BELOW the poverty line. Imagine trying to raise your family on at best $7000 a year. Impossible. We go into houses that are bare. Little to no furniture and little to no basic necessities of life. Most of the families rely on the local mission, but many cannot get to the mission because they are elderly, sick, and/or disabled.

Catholic Philadelphia Outreach goes directly door to door into these communities and provides help and hope. We are even helping some residents re-enter society after having been in prison. Some have expressed the desire to know Jesus Christ, and our goal is to bring them the light of Christ not only in word but also in deed. If you can help in any way, we will translate your donation into goods that we will document from purchase to delivery.

                        Last November I went on my first mission trip, i'll be honest I was encouraged by Corri to go and tried to think of any excuse I could why I couldn't go. I had these preconceived notions that I was going to help someone who didn't want to help themselves and the trip would be a physical and emotimal beatdown. Man was I wrong, the trip not only helped the people on our adopted village in Guatemala but it also helped me group in my realtionship with God and make lifelong friends along the way.I have been giventhe wonderful opportunity to go to Cuba in October with our church, The Point Church of Charlottesville. As I heard about this unique opportunity, and was given an invitation to go, I sensed God calling me to be part of this team. It is our prayer that you will consider partnering with us to minister to the suburb of Havana, Cuba, known as Los Pinos. In Los Pinos we have the opportunity to partner with two other organizations to bring both physical and spiritual transformation to a community by the power of Jesus Christ. One of our partners is World Help led by its founder and president, Vernon Brewer. Over the past 20 years Vernon has been building bridges and relationships into Cuba, and has called this opportunity and partnership with The Point historic. As part of this transformation in Los Pinos, we will be a part of building a community center designed to minister to the elderly, disabled, people with addictions, as well as children and youth. The name of this center is the Go and Tell Community Center, which will be operated by our second partner, Go and Tell Ministry. This is a ministry that works closely with the Baptist Convention of Western Cuba, whose Board of Directors unanimously approved this project in April 2013. God has positioned us in this partnership to help bring this vision to a reality.On our October trip we will begin building relationships with the people of Los Pinos by meeting and praying for individuals in the community, attending house churches nightly, and participating in a youth crusade. In terms of the community center, we will also participate in the first part of the project, which is building the perimeter wall around the community center. Would you consider partnering with us, both prayerfully and financially, to enable us to go and share Christs love with those who need to hear? First and foremost, this mission and our team need prayers. Specifically, we need prayer for Gods protection, provision, wisdom, and love in interacting with the people of Los Pinos, preparation of the hearts of each team member for the experience, and preparation of the hearts and minds of the Cuban people so that we can effectively meet their physical and spiritual needs. Would you also be willing to pray about investing in Gods work in Cuba? If you are willing to assist financially, I need to raise $3200 by October 1st to participate in this ministry opportunity. Thank you for prayerfully considering joining us in this opportunity to reach out to those who need to know that God is real and that He loves them. If now isnt a good time for you to give, I do understand; however, simply knowing that you are praying for me as I seek to raise funds and while I go to Cuba will be a great encouragement! I promise to send a full update when I return. Sincerely,Matt

Hey everybody! I am thrilled to tell you about an exciting opportunity Ive been given. After a year of planning, I'm finally going to a 9-month discipleship training school in lesund, Norway, through YWAM (Youth With A Mission). What attracted me to this particular school is its emphasis on the creative arts and their relation to God. I feel a strong calling to be a musician, and this school will give me the tools and experience topush myself as an artist. The program, which runs from this fall through May of next year, is a combination of Bible school, missionary school, and music school. Well be given training in theology, prophetic worship, and the expression of the Gospel, as well as instruction in our creative tracks. I will be focusing on songwriting and music production. Over the course of the year well go on multiple mini outreaches in Norway. In March and April well be going on an extended, two-month mission trip to a location which will be decided later (it will be outside Norway, likely in a third-world country). I learned from my missions experience a few years ago the importance of having the support of others, both financially and in prayer. Would you consider supporting me again, or perhaps for the first time? The tuition amount for the year is $7,400 plus airfare. This includes both the lecture phase and the outreach portion of the program. My goal through GoFundMe is to raise enough to cover the outreach.

The easiest way to donate is through GoFundMe, but if you'd like you can send a cheque to me directly at:

1511 State Hwy 532Camano Island, WA 98282 Any amount would be greatly appreciated and even if you are unable to help financially, would you please be praying for me? For safety, guidance, and for us to be able to help the people who need it. Please call or shoot me a messageif you have any questions about the program (or just to say hi!). Id love to hear from you. I look forward to telling you about my experience!Much love,

Mae

                        Dear Sir or Ma'am, I am Pastor Johnny R. Sanford, Jr. of House of Saints Community Church A few years ago I was lifted up out of my body by God and told to build His house on the very spot where my wife and I was going to build our house. My first response was Lord thy will shall be done, my next response was Lord how am I going to pay for this I was barely making $6.00 an hour at the time, and He took me around the church and said when the last window go up it will be paid for. And five years later it's done paid for, debt free. Without loans, without grants and without a congregation at the time. Thank you Jesus!!! God did it, I just helped. We are 1866 feet away from the main highway we need a digital sign so new people and the lost will know we are here the digital sign cost at the low end is $10,000.00, so I am asking everyone that will allow God to touch your heart, to please donate in any amount to help us get a sign to bring the inportant word of God forward. We are only going on our third year and as small as we are we currently assist the ederly, the poor and the sick on a daily basis but we need more exposure to bring God's word out to the lost, this sign would really help meet this need. God Bless and Thanks ( www.hoscc.us)

                        Dear Friends and Family, Since the launch of Engage Church about 2 years ago, we have held to the truth that God has called us to Go to ""the ends of the Earth"" and share the good news. We now have a team of 7 signed up for a trip to Asia, leaving mid-May and returning 3 weeks later in mid-June.Isn't it difficult to imagine being a person who has never had the opportunity to hear about who Jesus is and the freedom and peace he offers? Even as we prepare to go, we are in prayer about how to share the gospel with the people there. There are still a couple billion people in the world who have not even heard about Jesus! This can seem overwhelming for us, but our God is big and able, and a main part of his solution is us, both you and I, as his ambassadors to the world.During our trip this year, we will be working primarily with college campuses, making relationships with students through sports and teaching English. We will also have opportunities to work briefly with an orphanage, a youth ministry and support those fighting human trafficking in the area.Our trip is going to cost about $2000 per person. To not burden the people we'll be working with, our team is raising our own support to finance this trip. I am writing you to enlist your prayer and financial support. God has given us ALL a call to GO. This year may not be your trip, but I am counting on those of you He has called to support this year, to help in sending us on this trip. Each team member is in charge of personally raising $500 towards the trip from friends and family, and then beyond this we are doing some group fundraising. We would be blessed if you can give in honor of an individual going or to the group in general. Please understand that I realize not everyone is called to help in every cause. I trust that you will hear God's voice and know if this is an area in which you can minister. If you can support us with gifts of $100 or $200, we'll make sure to thank you with some fun rewards, but even gifts of $25 or $50 would be helpful. Either way, I know everyone is called to pray, and I would very much appreciate your prayer support. I plan to give regular updates and will write all of you again after we return and let you know how the trip went, so that you can share in praising God for the results that will come from it. Thank you for your involvement in the sharing of the good news.If you prefer, checks can also be made out and sent to:Engage Church811 Laukapu St. Bay #5Hilo, HI. 96720.

                        Weknow a real good man. I, Vanessashare a birthday and a workplace with him. He works hard in environmental services and sometimes sleeps in his car when he has trouble making ends meet. Every Sunday for the past five years, no matter the weather, he prepares food and serves it up in Martin Luther King Jr. Park on Brambleton at 12:30. He feeds about 80 homeless men, women and children from downtown Norfolk each week, who congregate to get the warm meal and the warmer hugs, some gospel songs and a prayer that he provides them. They call him ""Brother Love"". He never asks for anything in return. The men just line up, letting women and children go first if there are any out, and politely take their portion with a gracious ""Thank you, God Bless"". They count on him for that Sunday meal and he ALWAYS delivers. He of course, would humbly never take the credit. When weask him how he does this every week with no consistent supporters, he simply states, ""God always delivers"". Help us, Bella Smith and Vanessa Bertini help God make his delivery to Brother Love. Easy and needed contributions that will go straight to a humble and hungry stomach: 62 pieces of Farm Fresh chicken (legs and thighs) from 21st St. Norfolk Store- $50, 5 loaves of sliced no brand bread $5, Large bag Costco napkins $8, 2 cases water $10, Bags of Clementines or banana bunches $6. Desperately needed also are men's socks, mens clothes of any kind, or women's large. Help ushelp him, or come on down and help us out yourself. Rain or shine, Sundays at 12:30.God delivers.

                        Thank you for your interest in supporting me in this new chapter of my life! Here is some more info about why I am fundraising:Recently, Ive felt God leading me towards a Disciple Training School (DTS) program with Youth With A Mission (YWAM), specifically a site located in Lausanne, Switzerland that will take place in January of 2017. The dates of the trip are January 10th to May 30th.It filled me with excitement and pure joy to know that this is something that has become a reality for me when I recieved my acceptance email. I prayed over this for a long time and felt so much peace when I received the yes. I have always had a heart for helping those in need and I know this experience will help me grow deeper in my faith in Christ and my passion for people. I look to experience God in a whole new light by stepping out of my comfort zone and living His mission. I believe God will not only use me but transform me in big ways while there and I cant wait to see what He has in store!I am now faced with the financial fundraising part of this journey. Currently, my total budget for the program is resting at $7,000. This covers the YWAM fees for the Lecture & Outreach Phase.On top of the Phase Fees, Im also budgeting air faire, transportation, food and other expenses while abroad, which will come in at about $1,500 extra which comes to a total of $8,500. I can't do it all on my own, which is why I am reaching out to you all for support! Any donation amount helps! I am confident that God will provide and I will also be contributing some of my own savings. About YWAM:Disciple Training School consists of two phases, the first being the lecture phase.During the lecture phase, students will spend approximately 3 months on the base diving deep into Biblical studies while building a close community with other international students as well as building community and evangelizing the city we are studying in by helping those in need and sharing Gods love through words and actions. The 2nd phase is the outreach, where students break into small groups and travel to 3rd world countries to apply what we learned from the lecture phase into real life. We will work within struggling communities and be a light for those who have not yet seen Gods grace.Here's a link to their site: https://www.ywamlausanne.comIf anyone would like to talk to find out more about the program or why I'm doing it, I'd be more than happy to have a conversation with you! Whether in person or on the phone.

                        Dear Friends and Family, Lately, God has really been challenging our faith to trust Him to be our everything and follow Him. We have decided to take action and follow Him into a life of missions and dependency on Him. For the short term, this season will be highlighted by two ""events.""
In January 2014, we will begin a 12-week training session with YWAM Kansas City better known as DTS (Discipleship Training School). This 12-week training session will be followed by a 10 week outreach overseas. (22 weeks total)
In August we will be leaving to Haiti indefinitely 1.5 years +) to do God's work through a Christian NGO. Our short-term vision in Haiti is to love the people in Haiti by providing jobs and setting up a shelter for abused women and an orphanage. Our long-term vision in Haiti is to plant a missionary training center with an initial focus toward West Africa.
In all of this, it is our prayer that God will train us to love him and to love others more deeply and intimately. So how can you partner with us? PRAYER SUPPORT:
For now, we have 3 prayer requests:
For protection over our family "" particularly Adelyn "" both physically and spiritually.
To joyfully walk in the discipline of the Lord as we take up our crosses and follow him.
For our Provider God to meet our financial needs.FINANCIAL SUPPORT:
We, as a family, feel a strong calling into a life of dependency on God. This includes finances. We believe God is calling us to depend on Him for our finances through you, our ministry partners. Therefore, we are not only looking for one-time donations (though we will thankfully accept them) but we are especially seeking long-term ministry partners who will commit to monthly donations. Your donations will be used for both ministry expenses as well as our family's necessities (i.e. room&board, food, baby products, transportation). Any surplus will be donated, in turn, to others in need.We updated the total amount that we need for the upcoming season:- $4,000 (one time) for housing in Kansas City- $10,000 ($5,00 each - one time) for the cost of our 10-week overseas outreach- $2,500/month for living expenses (for at least 8 months)Thank you for your prayers, financial contributions, and (most of all) love! 
In His love,John, Lydia, and Adelyn Yoon

St. Paul Steeple Restoration,"$12,675 ","$100,000 ",Faith," July 13, 2016",30,2,HOOPER,NE,256000,,4,"

The nearly 90 feet tall steeple fell to the east, onto the front steps and parking lot. Had winds blown it in the opposite direction, it would have landed on the 114-year-old building, likely destroying the sanctuary. We are extremely fortunate that the damage was limited to the steeple. Visible from miles around, the church can trace its roots to a German Lutheran congregation that formed in 1870. The current building was completed in 1902 for $6,000, according to a history provided by Jeff Kappeler, director of the Dodge County Historical Society/May Museum. It wasnt until 1917 that the church began providing some of its services in English.History like this cannot be forogtten, and the congregation at St. Paul's is working to raise funds to rebuild and restore the steeple to its former grandeur. We hope you'll help us in this effort! A temporary roof has been constructed, and work is underway to determine the total cost of restoring the steeple. Updates in that regard will be posted as we have them. Thank you!! **historical details courtesy of omaha.com  http://www.omaha.com/weather/powerful-storms-with-gusts-of-nearly-mph-rip-steeple-off/article_5977d608-43b1-11e6-836d-779b094a37af.html

                        Hi, friends!! Richard and I have decided to take a giant leap of faith and host a precious orphan from Ukraine this summer.To do this, it's going to cost a significant amount of money. We need to raise it in a relatively short period of time, but we know that God is a GOOD, GOOD FATHER!! He longs to bring the fatherless into loving families, and He will help us reach this goal!We wanted to give everyone the opportunity to support this cause, because we know there are people who would love to be involved in such an undertaking, but can only do so on a financial level. Partner with us, and be considered a co-laborer in orphan care! This is just one avenue we're exploring. I'm 99% sure there will be some serious yard sale/pancake breakfast action too. If anyone has other fund-raising ideas that have been successful for you, please share them. We want to be good stewards of what is given, and with any fund-raising effort we may attempt. Approximately $3,000 is needed to bring our little one into the US. This covers the flight, visa, insurance, and any paperwork that may need to be done. The additional money will cover any expenses we may incur with clothing, doctor visits, medicine, activities, or any other various expenditure. (NOT to pay our bills!)If you would like to donate without using GoFundMe, just send me a message. Thank you so much for considering the life of one precious child, we're so excited to welcome them!!

                        We are the Call family and we moved to Uruguay almost two years ago to proclaim the Good News that Jesus Christ offers forgiveness and eternal life to all who will believe and trust in him. We work under the oversight of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and with Mission to the World. Moving cross cutlurally has been challenging and adventurous. We love working and living in South America, while at the same time miss all of our friends and places back in the United States. Becasue we live in a city with a public transportation system, we have managed to live without a car, but we now believe the time has come to purchase one. Vehicles are much more expensive in Uruguay, so we need to raise additional funds to cover costs. We have 8 children, so we will need a van large enough for our family. We have found a model that we are hoping to purchase (or a van of similar size) and would like to buy it by October 8, 2016. Having a vehicle will be a huge benefit to our family, our work and our church. This is a personal need and is not tax deductible. But anything you can contribute would be appreciated and put to good use for our family and the ministry. Thank you for considering helping toward this need!

                        Greetings friends and family! :)So as you all may now know -- I planning to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I will be serving people wherever I am called for a total of 18 months, and will have my papers turned in by the end of next week once I complete my medical check-ups.To serve this mission, I will need to fund the whole mission out of pocket which is $7,400. On top of the mission expense, I now have $1,200 that are due in medical expences for work that has to be done in order to be cleared on physical injuries from this past 1.5 years and dental work that has to be done before I can go serve.I have been trying my hardest to be self-reliant in preparing to serve as I believe it is important to do all you can to provide for yourself before getting assistance from others. I will have $6, 000 saved by the beginning of October by working 50-60 hr weeks to go towards my mission fund.--this leaves me with $2,600 left to earn before I leave.This money is purely used for food, gas, rent, and other essential items that the church deems necessary.The biggest reason why I am really excited about going on a mission is so that I can connect with people and make a difference in their lives. The gospel has made the biggest difference in my life. I owe everything to my Savior, my Redeemer, and I cannot wait to serve him entirely for the next 18 months! :) God is good and I know that wherever I am called, He will bless me to be guided to those who are searching for Him and those who need their burdens lifted - just like me. I rely on my Savior and my Father in Heaven, and I know that He will provide a way for me to make a difference in the lives of His children. There have been so many times in my life where all I want is peace, and it is only through Him that I can find it. How wonderful it will be to be able to bring a message and testimony of peace to those who live in a world of chaos, and a message of hope and love to those who feel there is no hope. I cannot wait to serve and play a part in this beautiful work.:)If you would like to be on the weekly email list while I serve my mission to see pictures and hear updates on God's hand in the work, then please let me know! :) I would love to share what I learn as I go through this journey in my life!

Deborah Salazar: Leaving A Legacy,"$7,836 ","$7,750 ",Faith," July 13, 2016",67,2,LOS ANGELES,CA,220000,,,"






                            Tamara Garcia
                            
                            
                                                           
LOS ANGELES, CA                                





                        Hi.My name is Tamara Garcia, the daughter of Deborah ""Debbie"" Salazar. Deborah was a sister, friend, co-worker, confidant, follower of Christ, and most importantly, a mother to her two treasures: Thing 1 (me, 21 years old) and Thing 2 (my brother, Felipe, 14 years old). Felipe and I came into this world because our Mom wanted to bring joy not only to her life but everyone else's.Deborah, my mom, was a strong and vibrant woman who had many years dedicated to the Lord Jesus Christ and her family. She still had many years more to guide her kids through life. To put her life in perspective in a few words or lines of sentences would not do her justice but I will try to encapsulate everything she was as a beautiful soul in this world.Mom, from day one, worked endlessly in her service to God since she was six years-old. She would help her parents, who were both missionaries,minister to others. After her parents passed away at 21 years of age, she was left with her two siblings, Naomi (my aunt) and John (my uncle). She worked so they wouldn't work so hard because both were minors at the time. She made sure she put a roof over their heads. Their bond is unshakeable and will last for all eternity. Once I, the best bundle of joy came into the picture, my mom strived to be the best mom she could. Made sure I was spoiled rotten with love. Everyone made sure I was dressed like a doll in cute Sunday dresses. Then the second bundle of joy came into the picture -- a baby boy. She expanded her love even more with my brother. She worked harder so we'd never worry about not having clothes or food on the table. We had our challenges just like every family. In our bout with domestic violence, we lost our home and our family memories (pictures, heirlooms, etc) but not our hope/will to live. It took years for all of us to heal from our wounds and rise from the ashes but we thrived. Her faith in God and love for us was unmatched by anyone I ever known. My mom, aunt and uncle worked as a family to survive. Sometimes we had nothing. Not even a home. Hardly any food. But... we got through all the struggles.Unfortunately, we can't have her here in person to see me graduate from a 4-year university and see my brother graduate from high school. She went home (Heaven) early. None of us expected this. As long as she went to battle with ""I will live for my kids"" as her armor, we marched behind her, fully supporting her. We wanted more time with Mom but we treasured every breath. Her life fight song through ourdomestic violence experience was ""I will live for my kids"" and it continued to be the song she sang as a single-parent, when she was battling cancer and doctors labeling her as ""terminal."" Once she was diagnosed with cancer, she marched forward with her fight song, wanting to live for us. She taught us that ""can't"" is not in our vocabulary. It wasn't in hers. She defied all odds. She was a woman that was a warrior.Please find it in your hearts to donate whatever you can in order to support the overwhelming costs. The money will go to provide relief in our hearts, knowing she can have her wishes of being buried next to her parents. There is an urgency to raise funds by July 21st. We appreciate any amount of support. We thank those that have supported us with unyielding love in our challenging times.She did not lose the battle against cancer because after three months of being on a roller coaster of in/out hospitalization, bottles of pills, and aggressive chemotherapy regime her life didn't end. She lives through me and through my brother. She was the best parent she could be, always supporting every academic and personal endeavor. She was the parent all my teachers knew. My Mom's memory means the world to me and it still hits me that I can't call her and tell her ""I love you"", go home for a hug or ask for her wisdom. This ambitious and driven woman didn't just fade from this earth.Felipe and I, we're her dreams, hopes, and aspirations -- her living legacy. We'll make her smile from Heaven.

                        Greetings!My name is Chef Grace Odogbili and I am seeking yoursupport to create the 2nd Annual Dining With Grace Banquet for homeless families in NYC.This event will feed over 300 of our homeless neighbors in Brooklyn, NYC. Our guests willbe welcomed to a surprise banquet full of expressions of love and hope from our volunteers and partners.  This event will include an amazing Chef created 3 course meal in a beautifully decorated dining room, full volunteer wait service, live music & performances, and special gift bags of toiletries, inspirational literature and more.This annual event was simply inspired by God's worldwide instruction to love our neighbors as we love ourselves; to offeras we'd like to receive.  As God's children we want to serve God's love to those who arefeeling down due to some misfortune. Weare all given gifts in order to serve each other and as long as we're here, it's not too late to use it.We envision tocreate a humanitarian impact based on the life and words of Jesus Christ. It is not theoretical or hypothetical but His love was quite practical, engaging, active and social. As a matter of fact, the entire reason I aspired to be a Chef as a young child is because I witnessed the cooking and serving of food to the homeless and addicted in our small church in Brownsville, Brooklyn. I understood that it was a kind of communication that at a minimum said, ""I care.""  It was non-judgemental.  I didn't truly know that years later, I'd be a Chef ANDcreating this amazing project.Thanks to our GoFundMe Supporters and sponsors last year we were able to feed, minister and offer special gifts to over 120 of our homeless neighbors in the city!! Thank you so much for your commitment! We are now planning for our 2nd Annual Dining event for 300+ of our homeless neighbors and are asking for your support in acheiving our goal of $6,500. Our Vision:1. Feed 300 of our homeless neighbors in Brooklyn, NY to a nutritious and delicious Chef-created dinner. Plated and Served by our Hospitality Team2. Decorate the dining room for a special occasion (linens, floral centerpeices)3. Live Music & Artistic Performances 4. Prayer & Faith-based Inspirational Messages5. Gift Bags for Men, Women & Children The beneificiaries of this event will be a shelter in Carnarsie, Brooklyn with full capacity of 320 residents. The residents will believe that they are simply going to get their daily dinner from the dining room but upon entry they will be greeted by this special celebration.We are 2 Months away! Pleasejoin us in making the 2nd Annual Dining With Grace Banquet a success. Please know that any amount you give, large or small will be a huge blessing to our community. Please help us reach our goal of $6,500 by August 15, 2016.If you are not able to give due to financial burden but are interested in volunteering your time or gift, please let us know!

                                                Atif and Samina Gill www.brotherinchrist.comI am Atif Gill from Pakistan. I am married with Samina Qureshi. God has chosen us to serve Him. By His grace we have been serving Him in Pakistan for more than 20 years. Our vision is to reach the nations and proclaim the Kingdom of God. As a Christian journalist I have worked in a Christian newspaper as an resident editor and my wife belong to a Muslim convert family. Their family was touched by Jesus Christ years ago with the help of His people. Her fathers testimony book can be found on the internet  The Peanut Butterman by Russ Irwin . We got married in 2010.  We started working together for the glory of God in different parts of the country. God has been gracious to us. We had a Christian book table in a busy market in Pakistan . My wife was serving in different places as an Evangelist. I am presently serving with "" Brother in Christ Ministry"" since 2007 as a volunteer.. Both of us tried to help our persecuted body of Christ in Pakistan. On Friday afternoon, Sept. 21, a mob of several thousand radical Muslims attacked St. Pauls Lutheran Church in Mardan City, Pakistan. The article can be viewed at the following link: http://www.persecution.com/public/newsroom.aspx?story_ID=%3D353431We were being threatened and life was quite dangerous so we had to leave the country. We purchased tickets and visas and went to Thailand. We had hoped that this move would be temporary as my wifes family is in Pakistan and we love the people there and want to help them. We decided, after only a couple of months in Thailand, that it would be safe to return to Pakistan. We again purchased tickets and visas and returned to Pakistan to serve the people there. By this time we had spent a lot of our savings on tickets, visas and paperwork. After a while in Pakistan we once again became victims of Christian persecution, but this time the victims were our own church family. We were at the bombing of the church at Peshewar. My sister -in-law lost her brother and nephew in this tragedy.We were at the church and were eyewitnesses to the many bodies that were torn and blown apart by the bombing of the church by suicide bombers. We were severely traumatized by the incident but still determined to spread the Gospel of our Lord. But things got far worse. We were getting death threats. We received two death threats by letter. We were once again, for the sake of our lives, forced to leave Pakistan. My wife owned two plots of land that she sold and we also had a car, which we also sold in order to help finance the tickets, visas and paperwork to return to Thailand. By this point we had spent most of our savings and the assets we owned on tickets and visas, for a total of over 18,000.00 dollars. We returned to Thailand again.78 killed, over 100 injured in Peshawar church attack http://tribune.com.pk/story/607734/fifteen-dead-in-suicide-attack-outsThe picture below is my wife, Samina, after the explosion took place.We are still serving in Thailand as evangelists. We are asylum seekers. We have spent a lot of our savings on visas and tickets. At this point we have spent all of our savings. Now we really need some financial support to renew our visas to stay here. My wifes visa needs to be renewed right away. We will be able to continue to stay in Thailand under volunteer visas, but that my wife take a course which is costly. We need 400$ for visa renew and after that my wife needs to take Tesol course to get volunteer visa under the Christian english school. The total fee of Tsol course is 800$. You can visit this website link http://www.aycteachthailand.com/node/88to get information related Tsol course and fee. This whole visa process and Tsol course will take two months. We do not have money to survive for two months. In addition to the immediate expense of my wifes visa ($400.00) and for the money required for her to take the Tsol course ($800.00), our monthly living expense is 300$ and we believe we will need support for at least two months which would be $600.00. The total amount we need to raise is 1800$. We believe in His provision.AFTER THE BOMBINGWarning:  This is a very graphic video, as it happened when Atif and Samina were there.

Atif wrote articles about Christian InjusticeOther Christian couples were being killed. One couple was burned alive. Atif and Samina began getting death threats They received two in writing which I am displaying below. I tried to find a program to interpret the following documents but I was unable. They are in Urdi.They received the above letters and the note written belowas threats to their lives.OurMission in Thailand.  We share the Gospel every chance we get.Muslims celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, Christmas, with Atif and Samina Gill! Praise the Lord!WHAT IS AN ASYLUM SEEKER?

CENTRAL POINT, OR                                





                        Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!My name is Rhianna, and I am a 24-year-old college student in the Human Services program at Southern Oregon University. The main pursuit of my life is to serve God by serving His people, and I've been presented with an amazing opportunity to do just that. My Church, Table Rock Fellowship, has organized a team to go on a mission trip to Uganda in November of 2016. During my two weeks there, I will have the privelege to contribute to building a primary school in Kiwoko, refurbishing living quarters for teachers, and ministering in the Kiwoko Hospital (learn more about the hospital here:  http://www.kiwokohospital.org/).My team hopes to to meet the practical needs of the local people, as well as to share the love and gospel of Christ.I once heard someone say that the most important thing we can send to countries in need is ourselves. This has been on my heart for years, and I have long felt called into missions. When I first heard that this project was being organized, I felt an immediate tug in my heart - God moving me to put my faith into action. I am overwhelmed with the desire to go and to serve in Uganda! I have such a heart for children, and providing them with a facility to learn in is one of the best things I can think of to give them. Refurbishing the teachers quarters will help them to bring in and retain teachers for the school. I want nothing more thanto come alongside the people of Uganda and work to see this dream become a reality.I will admit that I am terrified. I am terrified of flying for 30 hours, of leaving the country, of being so far from home, of malaria and LIONS (haha) - the list goes on. I have been terrified into inaction before, but not this time. This time, I know God wants me to move. The fact that I can't come up with the money on my own is intimidating as well, but my God moves mountains - OUR God moves mountains! He can definitely send me and my team to Uganda. I know that He will make a way where there seems to be no way.If He is calling you or you feel moved to contribute to sending me to Uganda, I will be inexpressibly grateful. Your donations will go directly to the cost of my flight and my room and board. Your generosity will change my life and, I pray, allow God to use me to change the lives of others.Thank you again for reading. Your prayers for myself and my team are greatly appreciated as well. God bless!~Rhianna""He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.'"" Mark 16:15""Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"" Matthew 28:19

I had the privilege of meeting Sis. Norma Gonzalez in 2014 and I knew immediately that our friendship was designed by God. She has been a continuous source of support and encouragement to my life and ministry, and to say that she has been a blessing seems like an insufficient statement. I have received a handful of invitations from her and Pastor Dan to visit them and their congregation in Oahu, HI, but it had not been possible for me to go before due to varying factors. However, the time has come for me to respond to their invitation and return the blessing to them. This trip will be extraordinary and different from anything I have experienced before. For the duration of the entire month of June (2016), I will be committing myself to the authority and service of Pastor Dan and Sis. Norma Gonzalez in service to them, their congregation, and the mission they are raising up in Oahu, HI. My intent is to go andoffer everything within my ability and means so that when I return to Colorado I will know without a doubt that I made an impact.There is a need for musicians at their church that has restricted them to use a recorded soundtrack to accompany their voices during their worship services. As a music director and worship leader I understand the frustrating limitation of not having live music. Because of this lack, their ten year old daughter, Lulu, is attempting to learn the piano. I see this as an opportunity to teach and mentor her musically so that she has a solid foundation to grow from. I recently viewed a video clip on social media of her playing at their service and it moved me deeply. She has potential and simply needs someone to nurture her ability and guide her. Offering her that instruction and piano lessons will be one of my main priorities while being there.

The biggest question Brad gets asked about his beard is ""How long did it take to grow it?"" The question we want to ask YOU is, ""How quickly can we raise the money to cut it!?"" 
Many of you know that our son Mason has been with YWAM (Youth With A Mission) since this past January. He has once again extended his stay. He is currently enrolled in the School of Compassion & Advocacy. He will be leaving again for outreach at the end of September to be working with and raising awareness in the area of sex trafficking. We are looking for ways to help him raise funds and support him in his efforts.
His willingness to continue following what God is calling him to do is inspiring to us and those around him! 
This is where YOU come in...If we can help him out by raising $1000 in the next 30 days (1/2 his outreach funds), Brad will be cutting off his beard~ not completely clean shaven, but cutting it all off. Many people wonder what he looks like underneath all that long facial hair? Here is your opportunity to see! It's been years since I've seen him without long facial hair. :)


Let's see how quickly we can raise these funds & get Brad ALMOST beard free!

                        Hi friends and family!I am thrilled to announce that I'm going on a Bethel Redding mission trip to the UK and Stockholm, Sweden from October 20-31st 2016! My team will be bringing the Gospel to Europe and spreading the goodness of God in nations that desperately need to know Him! I have raised 1,850 toward my trip which will cover lodging, food, and travel while in Europe.I now have a final goal of 850 remaining that will cover my cost of plane tickets to and from Europe which is due by September 27th.I am so blown away by how the Lord continues to provide for this trip making it so evident He has called me to go! If you would like to partner with me financially, I'd so appreciate any size donation! Thank you for helping to spread the love of God in the nations!More about the trip:The mission of this trip is to impact one of the harder places in Europe to spread the Gospel--the North. Recent statistics say that thousands per year are leaving the churches the in Nordic-Scandinavia region. The world is tired of religion--they want the ""real thing"". As a follower of Jesus, I believe it is my call to be ""the real thing"" and bring the light of Jesus to a world that needs it most desperately. It is time to see revival come to Europe!Part of our time in Sweden will be spent ministering at the Awakening Europe conference in Stockholm with Reinhard Bohnke, Todd White, Heidi Baker, and Ben Fitzgerald. The heart cry behind this gathering is, ""God, invade our nations with your love and win back millions of people to you like you did before!""Throughout our trip we will be doing outreach in every place we travel--serving the lost, hopeless, hurting and broken and pointing them to the Cross--the hope of salvation.How you can pray for our trip:1. That God would move powerfully and lives would be impacted, saved, healed, and delivered.2. That all of the finances would come in for my team.3. That God would go before us and prepare the hearts of the people we will minister to!""How then can they call on the One they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! Romans 10:14-15Thank you and much love!Mariel

LAS VEGAS, NV                                




One would think Las Vegas Devoid of all culture, but The Lohan Spiritual and Cultural Center is a refuge if you like, a group of well educated people following many different types of spiritual guidance, Buddhism, Taoisum , Native American spirituality. The goal is not money but awakening and enlightenment, in the middle of the Desert. Donations are always welcome to help fund classes that are open to all, please if you can donate please do all money is spent on Temple needs, not salaries or political aspirations.Las Vegas is an odd place to find such a unique and special place to learn and adopt many forms of Buddhist practices. The Lohan Spiritual and Cultural Center is multicultural ( 70% Buddhist, 20% Taoist and 10% Native American in philosophy and practice).It has been with quite some soul searching that we ask for help, and as the Secretary of the Lohan Spiritual and Cultural Center it was my idea to build this page, and thus my name appears at the top as 'Creator', if like me you have questions and an inquisitive mind and are looking for eventual enlightenment LSCC offers lessons ,classes and guidance in a friendly and informative way there is no charge for these events but dana is expected (the amount of dana (donation) is up to the individual). As Buddhism spreads west, many like myself find the Temple to be a welcoming and warm environment where there is no such thing as a stupid question, and a staff of priests with a knowledge and lineage  that is impressive to say the least answer questions and provide meaningful direction, simply put the best thing I have ever done for myself was to get involved.As I mentioned earlier we survive on donations, we keep costs a low as possible, but we do need some help financially, we have rent and utilities to pay and there are cost in helping the community anything helps !Dashi Steven BaughLineageOur Abbott is Dashi Steven Baugh, also known as Dashi Chuan Sheng Shakya. The Lohan Spiritual and Cultural Center is 70% Buddhist, 20% Taoist and 10% Native American in philosophy and practice. Our lineage allows each member to explore their personal spirituality. We have many tools and processes available to us, and few restrictions. We are a mixture of three different lineages of Buddhism - Chan (Zen) Buddhism of the Hsu Yun Order, Hanmi Buddhism under Master Yu Tian Jian, and Tibetan Buddhism under Lama Jigme. Our Taoist lineage is from Master Share K. Lew of the Complete Reality School. The LSCC is a multicultural organization, it is not necessary to abandon any existing spiritual practices or beliefs, as long as no sentient being is harmed.The Lohan Spiritual and Cultural Center operates as a headquarters of spiritual growth and education for the communities of Las Vegas and Southern Nevada.Our MissionTo work with all positive religions, learning the principles, philosophies and spiritual traditions of all faiths and cultures.Our GoalTo hold lectures and teachings on health, wellness, and spiritual knowledge.Integrity - Trust - FriendshipLohan Code of HonorIn closing I hope you can help $5.00 - $10.00 or more will go a long way to helping reach many more people across the world discover peace and enlightenment and locally the many ways the Lohan Temple can help and educate.

"Leah's ""Chicken Project"" for Uganda","$1,190 ",$800 ,Faith," May 11, 2016",26,4,MIDDLESEX,NC,166000,,3,"

MIDDLESEX, NC                                




Hello! My name is Rachel and my daughter is Leah. As many of our friends and family know, we will be traveling to Uganda for three weeks this coming June.  My sister-in-law, her husband, and their daughter are missionaries in Kisoro, Uganda. Mandi, Adam, and Kylie were in Uganda for over six months last year and hope to be there for one to two years this go-round. They work with the people of Uganda to teach about orphan care, spread the gospel, and show God's love in tangible ways to populations who are hungry for it.  We will be visiting our family there, as well as participating in ""The Chicken Project"" through CEAPU, Christian Efforts Against Poverty Uganda, an organization that was started by a former sponsored child of Compassion International. After finishing school and graduating the sponsorship program, Alex Munyantwari tried to help others to the end of his means. But the need was simply too great.Alex spoke to his former sponsor, now friend, about the struggle with what was in his heart versus what his hands could do. His sponsor told a similar story. As a younger man, he realized that he, alone, could not help those who needed it. But he could advocate for them to create a network with others who, together, could change the world.All over Uganda, there are children who go to school with no shoes, no paper, no pencils. There are children who drop out of school at the age of nine because a family member is injured or falls sick. There are children who have never tasted meat, never smelled soap, and never seen a book. And there are people, like you, who want to help them.We bring together those who need help and those who will help. We are not the answer to the problem. We are simply the voice of the voiceless, calling to the ears of those who will not allow the problem to go unanswered.CEAPU's focus is on some of the neediest children in the Kisoro District of Uganda, a rural farming community with the highest rate of malnutrition in Uganda. The ""Chicken Project,"" as it is so aptly named, is targeting these CEAPU families and will provide assistance and training. The project aims at helping to encourage self-sufficiency and increase knowledge of animal care. Each family is already working on preparing chicken ""coops"" using the resources they acquire themselves. My eleven year old daughter (with any assistance she needs from me) will teach a short-course on chicken care and husbandry. We will then have the priviledge of handing over chickens to those families. The families that receive these chickens will be able to have fresh eggs that they can either eat or sell to provide food or income for their family. We ask that you prayerfully consider assisting in providing families with chickens. A donation of $15 would provide a family with two chickens and feed to start them off. Such a small amount to us can make a world of difference to a family in Uganda. We are aiming to raise $800 by June to buy the chickens.  Any additional funds raised will be used to directly benefit the people of Uganda. The funds will be directly accessible to Mandi and Adam for obtaining supplies/poultry for The Chicken Project. We are equally in need of your prayers as we are of your monetary donations. Please pray for wisdom, guidance, and safety for us as we travel. Pray that God would prepare our hearts and the hearts of those we will encounter to love each other properly. Pray for safety, health, and joy for the people of Uganda. Pray for Mandi, Adam, and Kylie as they follow God's leading seven thousand miles away.  Thank you so much for your support in both donations and prayers. Together, we can provide support to those who seek it. 

Here is a link to Mandi and Adam's blog The Dust of Africa. Please take the time to read some of the blog. Both Adam and Mandi are gifted writers and share some very poignant and moving stories and images. https://thedustofafrica.wordpress.com/

                        Hello, my name is Steve Manne, and I coach the CYM basketball program at St Catherine Parish in Oconomowoc, WI.We are raising money to continue ourbasketball ministry during the 2016-2017 season. Since its inception our program has donated100% of our game admissions toacharitable cause in the community. The way it works is our players volunteer to hostbasketball games at our gym... The more volunteers we have, the more games we can host... The more games we can host, themoremoney we can donate to people in need...Our ""pay whatyou want"" strategy leverages the community's interest in giving. When that happens, therun-of-the-mill $2 feebecomes an outpouring of$5, $10, and $20 bills for a charity that matters.Last yearthe programraised nearly $5,000 for a family whose father lost his battle with cancer.The experience touchedour players deeply. Manyposted reminders of the family inour gym, and one bought a bouquet of flowersthat was placed on our bench before a tournament game.Our basketball program is made up of local youth fromourreligious education program. Last year we had nearly 40 participants,girls and boys, from6 different high schools in SE Wisconsin. We practice asone groupduring the week before breaking off into smaller teams to play on the weekends. The bonds built during the season become close friendships. And it's the player's connection to the charity that unites them as one family.The $1,500 we are requesting allows us to pay our league feesin December, and support 4 more basketball teams this season. By eliminating that fee, we candonate everypenny wereceive to a new cause that needs our help. Moreimportantly, your investmenthelps usteach our youth the power of giving. We want them to experience the process and become addicted to the joy of helping others. So when they leave our program, they remember the experience, and are motivated to pay it forward.This ministry is my life's passion. We started with a dozen kidsa couple years ago, and since thenwe'vetripled in size. Many of our players don't realize how powerful they are until they experiencethis first hand. They come tounderstand there is ""strength in numbers"" and that their actionscan make a difference in the world. We arelooking to eliminate all barriers so we can engage as many young men and women as possible. I'd be so grateful if you can helpsupport this ministry and allow us to continueteachingthevalue of community and giving back to others.

Maria's mission/class trip to Peru ,$795 ,"$3,200 ",Faith," February 21, 2016",14,7,KILLEEN,TX,165000,,,"

                        My name is Maria. I am the mother of two beautiful children (ages 8 and 5), a military wife, and a nursing student. After years of juggling family and school, I'm proud to say that I'm now just two and half semesters from graduating from the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. I started this page in the hope of funding a nursing-related trip to Peru that's being offered this summer as a part of my Global Perspectives class.Nursing is a passion for me, and I am so grateful that I'm able to help people when they are at their most vulnerable. Aside from my family, there's no greater joy than that feeling.I hope to have the opportunity to travel to Peru this summer to provide health education to villages and orphanages throughout the country. In addition to teaching locals and learning from them, I will provide Spanish/English translation to my team for the duration of the trip. Although my trip will be short, I believe that any difference I can make is worth it.Because this trip is offered as a part of a class, I have to pay to attend. I plan to use any extra funds from my part-time work as a nurse technician to go toward this trip, but it won't be enough. It's a little uncomfortable for me to ask strangers for help, but I would greatly appreciate your support, whether it's in the form of dollars, prayers, or words of encouragement.

MORRISTOWN, NJ                                




My Dear Friends,God does answer prayer. Twelve years ago, the Carmel community was under five sisters and their greatest worry was simply surviving. Today they are a community of 18 sisters. Vibrant with a firm commitment to the guidelines given to them by St. Teresa of Avila, the Reformer of the Order of Carmel Discalced, these young sisters are committed to praying for us, day and night, that in a turbulent world we may know the joy of peace through communion with God. Their entire life is work, prayer and offering sacrifice for the world. They have truly given up family, travel, entertainment and other basic human enjoyments.Today, the sisters have been blessed with many vocations and it seems that many people are drawn to the monastery for spiritual renewal and opportunities for holy Mass, the praying and singing of the Divine Office, the Rosary, Novenas and other special spiritual and musical events throughout the year. These sisters are a treasure in the heart of Morristown, NJ while the world is circling around them with great speed and preoccupied with many things, they remain still and listen to God. Personally, for the last four years I have been privileged to be a priest volunteer who offers holy Mass and other spiritual events for the Carmel community. This has confirmed my own love for the priesthood and with the sisters praying for me I have been energized to go in many new directions that I never could believe God was also calling me to. This is what their holy life inspires and when you can take the time to experience them, it is contagious! By your own willingness to pray more and live simply, you will find these sisters to be the model, par excellence.Financially, they are greatly burdened as the monastery, itself, is in need of repair and the community has grown so large that the sisters will need to consider buildinga second monastery.We ask you to consider a donation to support these, my beloved sisters, who live depending on us for basic needs and Jesus for your needs and our Holy Church. We live in challenging times that can often discourage us, but because of the Carmel, we have an opportunity to take our story and rescue it from its isolation and re-tell it through Jesus Christ. I beg you, to participate in this financial endeavor that these sisters so bravely need our support. For them, it is a first time appeal, but they are truly confident that Jesus wants them alive and well in Morristown! Please go to:  http://de.gofund.me/whzyasYours in Christ,Fr.

                        Hi! My name is Monique and I am a full time missionary in the city of Los Angeles. I work hands on with victims of human trafficking. The issue of human trafficking is huge within this city and the need for workers in this field is just as big. The days are long, trying, and chaotic. Working in this field is very stressful and the added stress of not being able to provide for myself can be very overwhelming.Los Angeles is an expensive place to be in general but even more so for a missionary, it is hard to make ends meet some months. I love the work that I get to doandthe population I get to work with, I want to continue to be here to work with these victims of human trafficking but in order to do so I am in need of some extra support. Asking for help and financial support is not my strong point but I know if I am teaching people that it is ok to ask for help because people care and want to help then I need to follow my own advice and put my own words into practice. With all that being said I am in need of some financial support to be able to live in this city and to be able to care for myself and in doing so it then allows me to love and care for these girls. I know that you can cannot take care of other people if you cannot take care of yourself. My goal is to raise 1,000 to help keep me a float and to take care of the basic neccesties. At this point any little bit would be appreciated. This would allow me to continue pursuing my dreams and to help care and see restortation happen in the lives of these women. By supporting me you are also supporitng and sowing into the lives of these women who are coming out of slavery. This would mean the world to me and I am so thankful for any kind of support. Thank you for supporting me in my dreams.

                        Hey! Im Eric, a student at Grace Bible College. I'm currently getting my Bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies, and my Bachelor's degree in business management.I've been honored with a huge opportunity recently:2012: I went on a Mission's trip to Germany, & France. I had the awesome opportunity to share God with people on the streets & in their homes, as well as organize2016: I have another great opportunity to go on my second Mission's trip ever. This time, my goal is to go to Ireland, a place I've dreamed of going. This trip will be part of my sociology credit for my degree, and will incorporate street witnessing to homeless, drug addicts, and others who need love.This trip means a lot to me because ever since I went on the Germany trip, I have felt called to visit another country after having such a great experience. Being a college student, it's not always easy to afford big things, but I'm determined to go to Ireland, God has this is mind for me!Be in serious prayer! This is a great chance, and you can support financially! Even just a shout out or a prayer, is just as cool as giving money.Thanks :)

                        I'd like to start off by giving God thanks for what he has done and is going to do in my life. I didn't decide to attend Atlanta Dream Center unitl May, but I knew that God was guiding my footsteps. I'm super excited to begin school and dig deeper not only into His Word but His presence, and to know God on a deeper, intimate level. I visited the school in April and fell in love with the people there! And just how God is present! One thing I was worried about was the funding but God is proving! If it is God will for your life, God will provide! put all your trust in Him! Let God be your bedrock and foundation, let God be the one you go too! He will never let you down! So I put my trust in God that he will provide! If you can give that would be a blessing! and if not in materialistic things, Your prayers are always wanted! All funding goes towards tuition for school! Thank you to all who have already gave and for your prayers! Be blessed in Jesus name!

                        Hope Anew Ministries in Nairobi, Kenya isdedicated to promoting the truth of the Word of God to younger generations and setting them on the path to a right relationship with God byproviding opportunities for children in impoverished areas to learn about the mighty works of God and His Son Jesus Christ. Currently, our bible clubs and other creative activities are held at Hope Anew Children's Center. We are rejoicing at the provision of nine acres of land in a scenic and picturesque area away from the city slums! This is the place where we plan to establish Christian camp facilities to host hundreds of our children during school break. We will also plant a garden where food for use during the camps will be grown. In order for this to happen, we need to sink a well to access water. This is because the area where our land is located is very dry and there is no water. We know that the lives of many children will be impacted and transformed through the power of the gospel. Along with the gospel, education is important as it provides children in impoverished communities with opportunities to break away from the shackles of poverty in the slums. Subsequently, we plan to establish a boarding school where children will receive a holistic education as well as vocational skills such as carpentry, tailoring and farming. We also hope to reach out to the Masai tribe, a pastoralist warrior tribe who live in this area. They have indicated that they would like to learn basic farming methods for their survival as the current way of life is not sustainable due to land shrinkage as more of their tribesman sell land to developers. We would like to invite you to be a praying partner with us to raise the funds needed to sink the well! Thank you so much for your support and God bless you!

UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2016:Dear Friends,We felt it was necessary to give a further update on the situation of our Paksitani friends.When we first created this page last year, we had big hopes asylum would be granted and we were already planning to get funds for their education so that they can get a better job once becoming legal aliens. However, things have not happened the way we hoped and here we are, over a year later, with an asylum request that has been rejected 3 times!! Each appeal was rejected.The lawyer has now decided to appeal at the European Court, which is our last resort. The bad news is that it can take up to 4 years before the European Court of Justice will review the case, so in the meantime our dear friends will need to keep on living out of charity. Their life is very difficult and we want to collect donations to help them ease their situation.If you wish to help further, a petition has been created online. If we collect enough signatures, the lawyer will be able to use the petition to strengthen the case in front of the European Court and the Dutch Government. So please sign it, as your signature can make a difference!Here is the link:  https://www.change.org/p/government-of-the-netherlands-grant-asylum-to-mariam-and-amir-a-persecuted-pakistani-christian-couple-------------UPDATE JULY 2016:Dear Friends, over a year had passed and things have not changed much. Our friends' asylum request was rejected again in December. Now they are still living illegally in the Netherlands and the lawyer said he is working on bringing their case to the European court but it is going to take maybe 2 years or more. In the mean time, they ll have to live illegally and with no income.They currently live with two religious brothers so they dont have to pay for food and shelter, but they still need money to buy clothes, toiletries, take the train to go to some place etc.. If you would be generous enough to make a donation, big or small, to help them that would be great and I am sure they will be very grateful! Surely money wont solve most of their problems right now, but it can at least make their lives a bit more enjoyable! Like going out and eat ice cream, go to the movies. Buy new clothes or shoes if they need it.Thank you very much in advance for your kind generosity!Adeline & Paolo--------------Love is free! Thats what makes it so beautiful and special. It may have unintended consequences, however.We are Paolo and Adeline, an Italian/French married couple since 2009, blessed by the birth of three wonderful boys. We live in the Netherlands, and are very active in our local English-Speaking Catholic community. It is through this community that we had the great opportunity to meet a young married couple from Pakistan, Mariam and Amir, both in their 20s [1]. Everything started because Mariam and Amir had the desire to attend Holy Mass in a language familiar to them, English. Thus, they contacted the church where we give our service. It is at that time that we could learn a wonderful story of true love, but full of unintended consequences.Mariam was born to a Muslim family. At the age of 20, she was promised to a cousin more than twice her age. But Mariam had other plans, she wanted to marry a young man she fell in love with, Amir, whose family was Christian.When Mariam was informed about her arranged marriage, she couldnt accept it and claimed her right to freely choose her spouse. However many Pakistani families believe it is dishonorable for a woman to fall in love and choose her own husband. Women are expected to agree to arranged marriages and refusal can lead to an ""honor killing"". Indeed, when Mariam mentioned about her feelings for Amir, she was beaten strongly, so strongly that even three years later she still suffers from chronic pain. The mistreatments continued as none of the parties wanted to step back from their positions. It was time for Mariam to make a courageous decision, and she made it. One night she left home secretly, and moved to Amirs house. She soon converted to Christianity and married him, in secret.Unfortunately, Mariam's family took it extremely bad and started chasing them. One day, as Amir was in the street, he was aggressed and shot. Thankfully, the bullets did not hit any vital organ. After Amirs recovery (he still has some difficulties walking), the young couple hid in a convent several hundreds of kilometers away from their hometown. For almost a year, they could not get out from there. Very soon, also Amirs family had to hide as well, as their life was in danger. Amir is now very worried about his familys safety in Pakistan.Fortunately, some fellow Christians arranged for Mariam and Amir to travel to the Netherlands. They had to leave everything without knowing whether they could ever see their family again, as it was not safe anymore for them to stay in Pakistan. At this time, Mariam and Amir are waiting for their asylum request's approval, while they live at some religious brothers house.We want to help Mariam and Amir to have a normal life in the Netherlands and also support his family in Paksitan. We are moving to the USA at the end of the month. Once they will get asylum (if they get it..), they will receive a house and a small stipend from the Dutch government, but they will need some additional money to settle down (buy furniture for their apartment for instance). Amir would like to go to college so he can also get a good job to support his family. Mariam and Amir are truly amazing! They pray so much and despite all their problems they still have a very strong faith. They now also occupy a very special place in our life, they have become like family! Our first son refers to Amir as his second dad. We hope in your generosity to help them. All together we can defend the right of Amir and Mariam to love each other, freely.For updates, you can like the page we have created on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/supportmariamamir [1] For safety reasons, we have preferred hiding the true names of these two persons.More about Christians in Pakistan: click here .Another story about a love marriage ending in drama in Pakistan:  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/05/us-pakistan-woman-idUSKBN0EG1XM20140605

                        Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!My name is Rhianna, and I am a 24-year-old college student in the Human Services program at Southern Oregon University. The main pursuit of my life is to serve God by serving His people, and I've been presented with an amazing opportunity to do just that. My Church, Table Rock Fellowship, has organized a team to go on a mission trip to Uganda in November of 2016. During my two weeks there, I will have the privelege to contribute to building a primary school in Kiwoko, refurbishing living quarters for teachers, and ministering in the Kiwoko Hospital (learn more about the hospital here:  http://www.kiwokohospital.org/).My team hopes to to meet the practical needs of the local people, as well as to share the love and gospel of Christ.I once heard someone say that the most important thing we can send to countries in need is ourselves. This has been on my heart for years, and I have long felt called into missions. When I first heard that this project was being organized, I felt an immediate tug in my heart - God moving me to put my faith into action. I am overwhelmed with the desire to go and to serve in Uganda! I have such a heart for children, and providing them with a facility to learn in is one of the best things I can think of to give them. Refurbishing the teachers quarters will help them to bring in and retain teachers for the school. I want nothing more thanto come alongside the people of Uganda and work to see this dream become a reality.I will admit that I am terrified. I am terrified of flying for 30 hours, of leaving the country, of being so far from home, of malaria and LIONS (haha) - the list goes on. I have been terrified into inaction before, but not this time. This time, I know God wants me to move. The fact that I can't come up with the money on my own is intimidating as well, but my God moves mountains - OUR God moves mountains! He can definitely send me and my team to Uganda. I know that He will make a way where there seems to be no way.If He is calling you or you feel moved to contribute to sending me to Uganda, I will be inexpressibly grateful. Your donations will go directly to the cost of my flight and my room and board. Your generosity will change my life and, I pray, allow God to use me to change the lives of others.Thank you again for reading. Your prayers for myself and my team are greatly appreciated as well. God bless!~Rhianna""He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.'""

                        Four years ago, I spent two weeks on a mission trip in China. We spent time loving children in an orphanage, encouraging young students and ministering to new brothers and sisters in Christ. The people I met and the experiences I had were more than amazing. I thought I was going to China to change lives. When I came home I realized, I was the one who had changed. This is Joyce. Joyce is a ""garbage baby"". Her adoptive parents found her in the garbage.As soon as I got home, I knew I wanted to go back. On October 8, I finally have a chance to return to China. I will be traveling with approximately 30 others. Once again we will be bringing in necessary supplies, loving and serving in orphanages and ministering to many.I have already raised the necessary money to fund my trip. However, once I get to China I will need additional money. Some of this money goes to fund incidentals for me while there. But much of it goes to the Chinese people themselves or to those who serve there. For every donation I receive I will put your name in a hat. If I raise my full goal I will away the following: 1) $50 gift card to AMC Movies 2) $75 gift card to Lettuce Entertain you restaurants 3) $100 gift card to Amazon 4) a 2 hour ""pizza and play"" party for up to 15 at Goalaso (in Carol Stream, IL-Local friends only. :) ) (a $250 value) I will draw names on October 3.Your consideration in helping me reach is goal is so appreciated. I can't say enough how impactful the work is and how greatful I am for the opportunity to go and serve in this amazing country! Thank you!

                        My name is Todd Brandt. I was commissioned by God to write a book about 2 years ago. It is now finished and I need to have it published. In the book I invitethe reader to go on an adventure of a lifetime as the 13th apostle. Together we will journey as those who traveled with Him as His closest friends. I challenge the readers to insert themselves into the story of the Gospel writers and to consider what they would have said and done while experiencing the gospel narrative. I believe once the book is published and others read it lives might be changed to the glory of God.  If you can help me in this, I believe we can help others reach a faith decision in Jesus.  I believeGod had a plan and a purpose for my efforts and I trustthe results to Him. I appreciate your consideration and may God bless you with His matchless grace.

                        Macedonia Baptist Church (MBC) is located in Hobson Village (a former slave settled community on the National Register of Historic Places) in Suffolk, VA. The current sanctuary was erected in 1900, with the earliest documented cemetery burial in 1892. There are approximately 350 gravesites, many of which are in various states of disrepair. Gravesites are sunken, unmarked, and literally broken; and the land is in an even worse state. The cemetery is partially located on wetlands that need to be excavated and stabilized in order to prevent further sinking of the gravesites and damage to the land. Excavation costs alone could reach $20,000. Macedonia is a small church of predominately low-income members who are unable to fully fund the estimated cost of repair. Multiple state and national organizations have been contacted to little avail. Some assistance has been provided by the city, but additional help is desperately needed. Your donation will help restore and preserve this historic and cherished land and cemetery to its rightful condition. We truly appreciate your contribution!! 8300 Crittenden Rd., Suffolk, VA 23436

Due to this cost, Karen is unable to attend church as often as she would like. Karen's faith and ability to worship is of utmost importance to her.  We would love to enable her to attend church more often and I set a goal amount that would allow her to attend church once a week for a year, or every other week for two years.Karen is an amazing woman who inspires all who know her with her faith and tenacity. Thank you for visting her go fund me page and let's get Karen to church!- Melissa Pruch

                        Hi Friends and Family!God has been putting it on my heart to go on a missions trip to South Africa this year with an organization called Camping 4 Africa. I have been praying about it a lot and I have decided to take a step of faith and go! The trip is coming up fast and I only have a short time to raise the support I need to make this trip a reality. I know that this is something God has challenged me to do so I know He will provide.The goal of Camping 4 Africa is to put on summer camps like a VBS to reach out to the children trapped in poverty, abuse, violence, and crime. We are going to bepresenting the Gospel to underprivileged children and beloving on kids who need it.There are two ways that you can support me on this trip. The first one is prayer. This is the most important way to support me. God is going to do amazing things on this trip and is going to use our team and me in some awesome and excitingways, but we need your prayer! If you can be in prayer for lives being changed, people being loved on, and people coming to know Jesus love for them that will make a world of difference! I also need you to be in prayer for funds. I have to have $3000 raised by October 30th. That is another way you can support me!In order for me to be able to go on this trip I have to raise $3000 to cover the costs of my flight, meals, and supplies for the camps we will be putting on. I know the Lord will provide these funds for me through whoever would like to support me in this way. If you would like to support me financially, there are two ways to do that. You can either write me a check or support me on my GoFundMe account.I am so excited for this opportunity and to see how God works on this trip and in the lives of the people we are going to meet. Thank you for your support both in prayer and financially.If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask!

She is one of the most selfless people I have ever met. Because resources are so hard to come by, AND a very brutal winter is on its way,I want toto send her a multiple packages FULL of not only necessities for winter, but also a box of her favorite things that cannot be attained in Nepal (food, etc).100% of the money raised will go toward purchasing items for Kayla for the winter season. After everything has been purchased, a complete list will be sent to all supporters, and ANY money remaining will be delivered to Kayla to fund her plane ticket home in January.Thank you in advance for what you are going to do.- Bailey

Family and Friends,This summer I have a great opportunity to participate in a GO (Global Outreach) Team with Bible Center Church to a LIFE (Life Impact For Eternity) Camp in Sistarovats, Romania. We will be going July 16-23 to help out one of our missionaries, Eric Murphy. LIFE uses sports and teaching English to bring young people (ages 12-19) to their camps. I am excited to use the ability that God has given me to effect change in young peoples lives on the mission field.I am very excited to be apart of this trip and to be able to minister to so many people for Christ. But I cannot do this alone. I need your help. First, I need prayer supporters in a three-fold way. 1) Safety for myself and for my team members. 2) Wisdom and willingness when witnessing to the students that we would be sensitive to the Holy Spirits leading. 3) Unity among the team members. Secondly, I need financial supporters. I am responsible for $2,300. If you would like to contribute, please send a check, by July 3, 2016 made out to Bible Center Church with Sonya Butcher Romania GO Team on the memo line. All contributions are tax deductible. Your support, encouragement and prayers are very much appreciated!Once I return from the GO Team trip, I will send a follow-up letter to share how the Lord used us in Romania.Thank you so much!!

It was an area I finally felt I was good at.

                        I have been given the opportunity and honor of being able to return to Dublin at the end of February 2017. Last year, the trip to Ireland made a significant impact on my life and hopefully we did the same for the men and women we came into contact with over there. This year we are going to spend more time at Tigland, a drug and alcohol treatment facility, this is where my experience is going to be most beneficial on this journey. I have struggled with addiction for many years. It was only when I turned my will and my life over to the care of God that I was able to obtain sobriety. The money raised will go directly to West End to cover travel, meals, and boarding. I am very thankful for any support in whatever form that may be. Michael Armentrout is the mission director at West End, he was kind enough to provide this letter for me, please contact him or me with any questions. Thank you. To those who know and care for Tommy Parker,My name is Michael Armentrout. I have been serving in Nashville on staff at West End Community Church for two years ( www.westendcc.org). During this time, it has been a privilege become friends with Tommy. Tommy and I connect both at church and outside church as well. He is a man who is learning how much his Lord loves him and how that love not only shows him how to live but empowers him to do so. Thank you for sticking with him. I know he has not made it easy in the past. Some of you reading this have been walking with him for many years. Your faithfulness to Tommy does not go unnoticed.Last year he joined his church on trip to Dublin, Ireland which I led. He was key member of the team because he leads out of his brokenness. He knows all humans are fallen. Tommy names his failures and doesnt try to hide them. The impact he makes on the team is important. The impact this trip makes on him is even more important. This years trip is going to be from Friday, February 24  Saturday, March 4, 2017. 1. We will again be working with those in recovery at Tiglin ( http://tiglin.ie). We are planning to spend three days with them. This would allow for our girls to spend a full day at the womens facility and for all of us to engage in an off-site retreat for the stage 3 & 4 guys. We may also do a service project on the grounds at Tiglin. 2. We will again be interacting and encouraging those in Dublin city center who are resistant to beginning their recovery by engaging them with hot drink and food. The outreach is and extension of Tiglin and is humorously named NoBucs.3. We will be serving in various capacities at the Lighthouse ( http://dcmlive.ie/about.html)4. We will continue serving and worshiping at Liberty Church ( http://libertychurch.ie/)If you are financially able and if you have also seen authentic change in his life, please support Tommy so he can attend our next trip to Dublin. The total cost is $1825. If you would like, you can send money directly to me.West End Community ChurchAttention: Michael Armentrout235 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209Please do not hesitate to contact me directly for any reason. My email is michael@westendcc.org. I would not write this letter if I was not extremely proud of Tommy and confident of his growth and maturity. Holy Ghost is steadily working in Tommy and sanctifying him just as He is also working in all of us who put our faith in the Lord Jesus. Blessings,Michael

I am currently on 62 days clean right now, and no plans of stopping. Everything is not just falling into place (not that I expected it too) but if there is anyone willing to help me out getting back on my feet, here are a few things id like to use the donations for. I would like to be able to reinstate my license that is approx $305. Id really enjoy some cheap transportation to get me back on the job force, these ideal hands are hard. The last thing if there is enough, i would like to hire someone to mediate the divorce and custodys issues at hand. Ive always done farley well as a functioning addict, now lets see what i can do sober. Thanks everyone. Feel free to ask any questions.

We will be going with Connect Community Church in Pasadena to reach out to orphanages and pregnancy Center to help those in dire need support in Costa Rico.

We are looking at the total cost of the trip at $2800 for both of us together. Our churches deadline for a deposit is in November, but the trip itself is January 27.By going on this mission trip, we feel that we can touch many lost lives, but also help us grow through Christ! This trip will mean the world to us. If we raise enough money to go on this trip, we will be soeternally grateful! We know God wants us to do great things on this beautiful planet that he created and we just want to be the hands and feet of Jesus Christ. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and we only pray God blesses us with what we need. Please just pray for us in our journey.

                        Hey! My name is Alisa Keaton. I am very excited to share with you what the Lord God has placed upon my heart. I hope that if you share in this heart and vision that you will partner with me to accomplish great things in the name of Jesus.My desire is to know God more and to share His love so that others may know Him also. That they may find that all strength and hope is found in His life, death, and resurrection. That they may see themselves through the eyes of a loving and gracious Father. To make disciples of all nations and for that disipleship to restore brokeness in us and our systems. To see the work of the Spirit set the captive free, and give the orphan family,My home (place of comfort, fulfillment, grace,and joy) has been with the ""least of these"" since my first short term missions trip in 2010.Since then, God has only grown my heart for His kingdom and for other nations.He confirmed this calling through Carl and Brenda Krames of Victory Church in 2014, who prophesied over me that God delights in my heart that says ""Here I am send me"" and that God would send me to the nations and the nations to me. That the verse for my life would be ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" That God has given me the gift of intercessory prayer and a teaching anointing. God continued to prepare me and deeper establish these things within me and inJanuary 2016, I moved to further live this out in Montrouis, Haiti. I became a teacher at Canaan Christian Community. This community provides holistic ministry in five components: a clinic, nutrition project, school, home for kids in need, and a church. This is a volunteer position and has been made possible through God stirring the hearts at Souls Harbour Church, as well as in my family, in generousity.After being there for 5 months I have connected greatly with the communtiy, built relationships, and grown in wisdom of how to be effective in missions. God has confirmed within me to be in Haiti more long term. In order to do this most effectively I believe a strong, discipleship and intensive ministry training is most benefical to me and to those whom I will be ministering. This is where I need you. I am going back to Canaan from August to December to finish my commitment to Canaan. When I finish my work at Canaan I will go to either Iris Harvest School or Ellersly Discipleship School. Both of which cost around 5,000 dollars. My teaching job is wonderful but does not pay, therefore I am not able to save. If you are so willing to partner with me in giving financially or prayerfully I would be humbled and appreciative. Thank you for taking the time to read about what God is doing in me and in Haiti. May God bless you and keep you!-Alisa

                        Dear Friends,I am writing to share some very exciting news.  I have been accepted to NET Australia!NET Ministries is a peer to peer Catholic youth ministry in Australia.  NET Australia has, for more than 25 years, served Australia with the good news of Jesus Christ.  I believe that this ministry is extremely important, especially at this time in the Church's history.  Young people need to know that there is someone who loves them and cares about their lives regardless of what they are going through, and I believe that person is Jesus.NET, which stands for National Evangelical Teams, seeks to fulfill its mission of encouraging young people to love Jesus and embrace the Church by running retreats called Encounter Days, youth groups, young adult discussion groups, university ministry and a variety of other activities that seeks to meet the needs of people NET serves.Following  five weeks of training in youth ministry, I will be placed on a team with other young Catholics aged 17-30, and will embark on the sharing of my experience of Jesus' love with young people all across Australia.But, I can't do this without your support.  Firstly, I seek your support in the form of intercessory prayer.  I need people praying for me and the success of this mission. I also need your support financially.  I am committed to raising $7,200 prior to my beginning my mission.  I have raised $2,000 of those funds with my job.  I am hoping to raise the remainder of this balance.Please be aware NET ministries does not receive government funding but relies fully on the generous support of others.  My minimum goal can be achieved if I can find 36 generous people, each willing to support me for $20 a month for 10 months.  I have already received several donations and I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart.I would ask that you would prayerfully consider supporting me and the ministry of NET with prayer and financial support.  Your support makes it possible for me to serve with NET and helps to make as difference in the lives of many young people.If you have questions, please ask!Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely in Christ,Samantha

                        Hello!My name is Krystal O'connor, and I am a Junior at the University of North Texas. Along with my heart for children who are living in poverty, I have a great love for Jesus. This March 2016 I will be leaving home for San Diego, California and from there I will be heading to Tijuana, Mexico to do beach and city evangelism outreaches, working in orphanages, serving the church congregation in Tijuana, and more with Gateway young adults ministry, Seven.Seven's website best describes the mission by saying,""Jesus made it clear that His mission didnt stop with a single city, country, or people group. At Seven, our desire is to help create a culture of outreach where every individual, family or group can find a place to reach the lost, broken, and needy within our local communities and abroad. Were committed to equipping young adults to make a difference in the world in which we live."" My goal is to truly live out our calling to take the gospel to all of the nations. I want to reach the unreached during this trip and inform families, children, young adults, and the elderly that they are greatly loved by Jesus, who died to know each and every one of us. This mission trip could not only potentially change others eternity, butprovide growth for my ownrelationship with the Lord. This is a huge step of faith and I could not be more excited to see what the Lord has in store for me during this timeout of Texas!Now that you know why I have created this page - trips are not cheap! I would love for anyone and everyone to come along side me as I take the love of Jesus into broken cities. This money is so worth it to me! My heart is longing for the children and families in San Diego and Tijuana who have yet to hear about their invitation to salvation. The money I raise will go towards travel, stay, and meals. I am so thankful for this opportunity to serve the Lord outside of my community and I am so grateful for any amount of money that I will recieve for this trip!Please contact me if you have any further questions about my trip and the vision that I have for it!""Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'whom shall I send? And who will go for us?' And I said, 'here I am. Send me!'"" Isaiah 6:8And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.Matthew 28:18-20

                        Hey! Thanks so much for clicking on the link to my GoFundMe account and taking the time to read my story! My name is Ceydi (sounds like Sadie), I'm 20 years old, and I am heading off to YWAM Redding in January of 2017! Youth With A Mission (YWAM) is an evangelical inter-denominational, non-profit Christian, missionary organization. Founded by Loren Cunningham and his wife Darlene Cunningham in 1960, YWAM's stated purpose is to ""know God and to make Him known"". Throughout the year they have locations all over the globe that have 6-8 month training programs called Discipleship Training School (DTS), and do exactly that, trains missionaries in discipleship. My DTS will last 6 months; my lecture phase is 3 months and will be in Redding California. The second part of my training is called outreach, it will also be a 3 month period where I will spend my time in the mission field; the location of my outreach has yet to be determined but will most likely be in somewhere Asia.  My Goal with my GoFundMe account is to raise $3000 of the $5000 it will cost for my DTS. The cost covers: tuition, housing, books, food, as well as plane tickets,housing and food while in outreach. A total of $2,500 is due upon arrival, January 22nd 2017.  I want to thank you for reading about my upcoming adventure and even if you are unable to support me financially, I would like to ask for your prayers.  God is always faithful, He has put a call in my heart and with full faith I am trusting He will make a way for me.  Thank you for your support! God bless you and your family! -Ceydi.

                        Hi!My name is Anna Ferguson and I currently work as a Missionary at The Pines Catholic Camp in Texas. I graduated from Creighton University a little over a year ago and have been working at The Pines, sharing God's love through camp and retreat ministry, ever since.This summer, a fellow Missionary and I are planning to hike the Camino de Santiago (or Way of St. James) in Spain. We want this month-long hiking trip to be as much a pilgrimage as it is anything else. In order to make this trip a reality, I need your help. As a Missionary, I get paid a monthly stipend (enough to pay for what I need for the year) but it's not much. If I'm going to hike the Camino, it's going to take a lot of saving. While I have a special budget in place in order to save up for the trip, any donation you can make would help.The majority of the money will be used to cover the flight to and from Spain, the rest will help with food and lodging expenses along the way. Our trip is set for the end of May-early June 2017, so any money I can raise before then would be very helpful.As someone who has always wanted to travel abraod but hasn't had the opportunity to do so yet, making this trip a reality would be a dream come true for me. And because my faith is very much a part of my life, participating in this kind of a pilgrimmage would be such an incredible experience.If this trip works out, I will be so grateful to all who helped make it a possibility. Additionally, I will be accepting prayer requests to carry with me and offer up throughout the hike, especially in gratitude, and for, those who helped make the trip happen. Thank you for considering donating!

 https://www.gofundme.com/cmacameroonHi everyone,My name is Beverly and I am writing on behalf of CMA- Christian Missionary Assembly. It was founded by Pastor Victor Balinga in July of 2007 and has since then served its purpose. CMA is well known for its wonderful help to the sick, prisoners, feeding the hungry and needy and Pastor Victor's home has been open to so many both homeless and desperate etc. With the expansion of the church to various cities it has been so difficult to keep up due to increasing demand for help from various people.I am here asking for help for the Mbanga community, eventhough it wouldnt cover up to half of the CMA needs it will help and go a long way to reduce costs.Pastor Mbeng is the pastor of CMA Mbanga and is in the health care field this has also enabled him to help not only Mbanga but other surrounding communities they have happened to reach out to the sick, prisoners and other people.The church building is dilapidating and is in dire need of reconstruction and the are so many smart kids who want to go to school but cannot afford it due to lack of finances, not to mention people who are really sick and cannot get access to the healthcare they need. church rennovations could take any where near $600 to $1000 as you can see the buildings in the pictures. Kids need atleast $100 for tuition per academic year and another $60 dollars to buy text books and uniforms. For the sick if we can raise some money to buy basic painkillers, mosquito nets and etc it will help alot.Please be an answered prayer today and help this community of people in need. CMA means so much to me as they played a great role in my life and today I am in the US living a wonderful life- I wish I could help them all but on my own I can't It will help alot and I will be happy but I think it will mean even more to this community. Thank you and it is okay if you do not have, just help share. Every thing I collect here will be given directly to CMA. It will be nice if we can get this done before the end of September so we can get this kids to school, help the sick and fix the church building so people are not scared or worried each time they come to the house of GOD. PLEASE!!!Beverly on behalf of CMA

My church, Bellevue Christian Center, has an oppurtunity to build a school for underprivileged children who normally would not have a chance to attend school. The money would enable my transportation as well as housing and food while there. I would need $700 by September 7th to buy my ticket to Chile, and I would need another $1200 by September 30th for housing and food. I would love the chance to minsiter and spread the love of God to these children. The most important factor of this would be the children whose lives would be changed forever. Any help would be greatly appreciated and would go toward building God's kingdom.

Groundbreaking Atonement Model Book,$215 ,$27.50 ,Faith," June 13, 2016",4,3,IMPERIAL,MO,29000,,3,"

IMPERIAL, MO                                




Hello! My name is Jonathan Tyler. When I was in my twenties I had a counter-cult ministry outreach to victims of the destructive cult known as Jehovah's Witnesses. During the course of my ministry efforts, I would study a lot of deep theology in order to better reachthe Witnesses. As a result of this study, I became aware of some problems in my understanding of the Atonement, that is: why Jesus had to go to the cross for our sins to accomplish our salvation. These resisted my earnest attempts to find suitable answers in the theology textbooks that I would use to reach the Witnesses. So I prayed what I call my ""George Washington Carver prayer"" about the Atonement (Carver, a scientist, had famously prayed that God would reveal to him all the mysteries of the common peanut, the answer to which has led to some pretty groundbreaking inventions). I fully expected an answer to my prayer, but I was unprepared for the depth and breadth (and frankly the awesomeness) of what God was to reveal to me. That was over twenty-three years ago. Since then I have been diligently searching the Scriptures to see if these things were so, endeavoring to follow the example of the Bereans, mentioned favorably in Acts chapter 17.It was important to me to be absolutely certain what Id received was truly of God and solidly supported by the Scriptures. The study of the last twenty-three years has absolutely borne that out.I am attempting to write a book to share this amazing, life-changing revelation with othersa powerful understanding of the Gospel that I have already seen bear much fruit in the lives of those with whom I have shared it, especially with those who have been hurt by professing Christians and the institutional Church. I am especially eager to finally get this into print, as recent years have seen a lot of debate and discussion regarding the Atonement, particularly among those questioning what is called ""the Penal Substitution Model"". It seems that the sort of questions people have been asking and the sort of answers many have attempted to construct just happens to coincide with the revelation God gave me over twenty-three years ago. What I have been given seems to have the potential to revolutionize Christianity, evangelism and world missions, especially when it comes to those cultures that have been traditionally resistant to a specifically Western, individualistic, non-honor/shame cultural explanation of the rationale of the Gospel, such as is the case with the Japanese. If what I've seen so far of the fruit of this revelation is any indicator, this stands to reach many souls for Christ. The time is ripe for me to share this gift that God has given to me. I'm fairly dying to get it out.Herein lies the challenge: I have learned the hard way that every culturally ""respectable"" strategy I've come up with for being able to write this book has failed. I've tried doing it in my spare time while holding a full time job. That didn't work, as I'd have barely anything left for my family at the end of the work day, let alone for writing a book. I've tried holding a part-time job while working on it. That didn't work, either, because this process is very labor intensive, involving not just the writing of a book but almost what is like formulating a scientific theory, with every little change needing to be checked for how it impacts the whole system and squares with historic orthodoxy and the Scriptures. And, more recently, I've tried saving up thousands of dollars so that I could take time off from working to devote myself full-time to its writing, which is what I've been doing the last few months, carried by the occasional donation from people who believe in what I'm doing. But now my savings have run out. What further complicates matters is that I am the sole breadwinner in my family with two young children for whom I am responsible. That is making this endeavor very difficult for me and my little family. I have to be able to support my family whom I love and to whom I am devoted. Yet if I don't work on this book full time, I know that it will never get done. Based on my current rate of productivity compared to my ""to-do list"" for the book, I need at least one year of devoted writing and research to complete this project. In order to survive with my family for one year I need to raise at least $27,500. That breaks down to basically $2,292 per month for a family of four. I do not have to raise the whole amount to continue my efforts in the short term; I will go as long as I can with what I have and every little bit helps (so don't think that small gifts don't count). I'm very tenacious, having invested so much in this already myself. I have already invested several thousands of my own dollars and have done what I could with it. The money will go towards basic living expenses and supplies such as toner and paper (I go through a ton). It may occasionally be used for some light travel such as to raise further support for when the book is done or to teach small groups the basic theory. The more people that are aware of and believe in this project the better chance I have of getting it done.We will need at least $1,000 in the next couple of weeks to keep things going with our current expenses but the rest may be paced a bit such as through monthly giving if that is someone's preference. I'm not sure how the latter works through GoFundMe, but you may contact me privately so we can work it out if that's your interest.This book writing project means so much to me I can hardly put it into words. I consider this my life calling: something I have been fighting to get the chance to do for so long. Your donation will enable me to pursue that God-given calling at last. What's more, your donation will change lives. To give just one example, I had one gentleman, Terry, who was so impacted by this material that he came back to the faith after having left it years prior after being deeply hurt at his old church at which he was a deacon. He was absolutely blown away by the grace it bespoke. Shortly thereafter he died and is now in the arms of his loving Savior. Because of you, there will be other ""Terrys"". And, interestingly enough, this atonement model seems to really translate to people of this upcoming generation. God knows what impact your donation may have on countless individuals in light of Eternity.Words cannot express the deep gratitude I feel toward those generous souls who believe in me enough to contribute their hard-earned money to support me in this worthy project in which I believe so passionately. I pray that God, Himself, will richly and deeply bless you for your contribution to His work as I pursue His will via your kind and generous donations.

Thank you!

We, the members of the Board of Trusteesat Closer to God Evangelical Prebyterian Church along with our Pastor, Rev. Valdir Reis, are doing this campaing to raise funds to pay for our church renovation. The Temple at 36 Kearny Ave. Kearny, NJ. had been inactive for many years and by the Grace of God our church has had the opportunity to buy this property which includes the Temple, theChapel and the Pastoral House. Although the entire property needs work, the church's funds was used for the down payment and the chapel renovation in order to start the church services on October of 2015. Then, due to the emminent hazard to the public, the Town of Kearny has demanded for the exterior of the building and the roofing to be restored as an emergency. Actually, we were given until the end of September of 2016 to have the it accomplished... Our time is running short and the church does not have enough funds to pay for its renovation. Moreover, after praying about it, we've decided to use the ""GoFundMe"" system to ask for your financial support of any amount to help us to continue with this process of restoration and maintain the church alive. This Church is very important for us, for our congregation, and for our community and it must continue spreading the word of God and His Ministryby serving, helping and caring for people as it has been done through generations. Therefore, your Help and Support are so important and greately appreciated!PS. The church will provide a ""Donor Ackowledgement Letter""for taxes purpose. Thank you all,for your Donations and Prayers!May God Bless You!Sincerely,Maria C OliveiraClerk of SessionRev. Valdir ReisChurch's Pastor

                        I like to say I am an ecumenical creation of love, called by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to love all God's children with the love of Christ.It was twelve years ago, when I first felt God's call for my life. To spread the gospel of grace and love for all His children. Since then, it has truly been a journey! It has been full of many trials and tribulations and more grace then I could ever express. Through the strength and guidance of the Holy Spirit I have realized I can not do this alone. Seminary includingtravel, books, and time away from my family is not cheap.In addition to ordained ministry I feel called to serve as a military chaplain and minister to those who suffer with P.T.S.D. and their families. The love of Christ and supportofmy family and my friends hasrefinedme and taught me the meaning of fellowship in God's Church. We truly are more when we are together. I hesitated starting this Go Fund Me, but I have way too much love to give and share in Christ Jesus to ignore my need for support beyond prayer and moral support. I know that now. It is unfair to my first vocation, the care of my family, to ask and expect them to carry this burden alone. So, after much prayer and discernment I'm asking. Would you please help me prepare for ordained ministry to spread the gospel and the resurrection promise through Word and Sacrament? I also ask that you please continue to hold me and my family in your prayer as we move forward in this blessed journey together. My family and friends are my greatest gift on this earth. I know it will not be easy but with Christ all things are possible and we the Church are more when we are together. It is with deep humble thanks and gratitude I ask this. Thank you so very much for your time. May the grace and peace of Jesus Christ be with you now and always and know GLYASDI.(God loves you and So do I) PS:) I have set the amount to what I estimate I will need for the first year of seminary, the coming 2016-2017 school year. Thank You And God Bless You!,,/_
