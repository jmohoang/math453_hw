Send Brandon to MD Anderson (USD),"$116,906 ","$250,000 ",Medical," January 29, 2016","1,149",7,LEANDER,TX,4300,61,79,"                            Michelle Durieux                                                                                                                   LEANDER, TX                                                        Imagine you are 24, diagnosed with one of the most aggressive blood cancers, have already spent your savings (what little you have at 24), and had to quit your job 6 months ago due to your illness. You've moved 3 times in the last 4 months to get medical care and you were just told that there is no additional medical care left for you in Canada. You have to leave yourhome and your family to get care in another country at your own expense in order to have any hope at a viable treatment. That is the story of my courageoushusband, Brandon. This is why we desperately need your help.My name is Michelle, 5 years ago I was lucky enough to meet a wonderfulman named Brandon. We met online through a video game called World of Warcraft and were instant friends.Years later, we finally met in person when I took a trip to Victoria, British Columbia on a whim. We ""dated"" over skype and phone calls for months while Brandon was living in Victoria, BCand I was living in Austin, Texas. Finally, I decided to make the move to Canada, to take a chance ona wonderful man who I was falling for more and more every day.In July 2014, I moved toVictoria and Brandon and I have been inseparableever since.Our lives changes forever on August 30th when Brandon went in for a routine blood test. He called me, in tears, and told me that he had been diagnosedwith leukemia. The next 48 hours were a whirl-wind as we traveled from Victoria to Vancouver so that Brandon could receivetreatment at Vancouver General Hospital.Brandon was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). AML is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The term 'acute' denotes the rapid progression of the disease. It's called myeloid leukemia because it affects a group of white blood cells called the myeloid cells, which normally develop into the various types of mature blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. AML leads to the rapid production of dysfunctional white blood cells that crowd out other healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.When Brandon was diagnosed with AML, his white blood cell count was 45x10^9 cells per liter of blood (the normal range of white blood cells is between 4x10^9 and 11x10^9 cells per liter of blood). Within the few days before he started chemotherapy, his white blood cell count had risen to nearly 60x10^9 cells per liter of blood. His initial bone marrow biopsy verified his AML diagnosis and showed that 90%+ of the stem cells in his bone marrow were cancerous.Brandon's first round of chemotherapy, called 7+3 (7 days of a drug calledcytarabine and 3 days of a drug calleddaunorubicin), only reduced the cancer in his bone marrow to 40%. This regimen of chemotherapy puts 75% of leukemia patients into remission, but we were not so lucky. We had high hopes for the second protocol for treatment.Brandon kept his spirits up and pushed directly into a second round of chemotherapy, called 'salvage chemotherapy.' This more intensive chemotherapy is supposed to wipe out any remaining cancer cells at a high cost to the patient. Brandon became very ill, as his immune system as a whole was wiped out from the chemotherapy. His white blood cell counts dropped to zero, leaving him highly vulnerable to infection, and he receivedred blood cell and platelet transfusions every few days. Brandon was in incredible pain, due to the weakening of his body from the treatment.We anxiously waited and watched for a month to learn if the salvage chemotherapy had worked. The doctors kept telling usthat his blood counts would eventually recover, but as the weeks went by things were not starting to look up.His thirdbone marrow biopsy showed that his cancer had fought back up to 56%.We were devastated. Because the cancer count in his bone marrow was so high, it was preventing the growth of healthy blood cells in his body. Brandon was left with no immune system, no ability to fight infection, and limited ability to clot blood and transport oxygen throughout his body.Brandon and I got this news the day before our wedding on October 18, 2015. After nearly 2 months in the hospital, Brandon was released so that we could enjoy our wedding at his mother's home. Brandon struggled through the day feeling sick, tired, and nauseous, but kept a smile on his face the whole time. We put all sadness aside to enjoy a weekendin celebration of our love surrounded by our family and friends. It was truly the most beautiful day of our lives. Emotions ran high as we promised to love, cherish, and support one another forever. Never before had those words meant so much.After the failure of his first and second round of chemotherapy, his doctors did not have hope in other chemotherapy treatments. Brandon and I were told that chemotherapy would not likely work, since his leukemia was showing resistance to the strongest chemotherapy medications.Under the umbrella of AML, certain genetic mutations place you in various risk groups for relapse. We learned that Brandon's specific cancerous mutation, called FTL3-ITD,places him in the highest risk group. Without a stem cell transplant, Brandon's chance for a cancer free life would be extremely small. Unfortunately, a patient needs to be in remission (cancer less than 5%) to receivea stem cell transplant. Getting him into remission, was proving to be the hardest part. We had nothing left but to try enrolling Brandon in a clinical drug trial.Brandon's doctors informed us of a new drug that was conducting a phase III clinical trial at Vancouver General Hospital. The drug wasan FTL3 inhibitor, that was designed to damage only the cancerous cells in his body. We were thrilled to learn about this new treatment that could put him into remission.On October 27, 2015, Brandon beat the odds and was randomized to be one of the 2/3 of patients to receivethe medication. We were over the moon!The mediationlooked very promising, with Brandon'ssubsequent monthlybiopsies showing bone marrow cancer counts of 31% and 9%, respectively. We thought that surely his next biopsy would give us the remission we had been waiting for. Brandon's doctor's were so confident, that they started to schedule his stem cell transplant for mid February 2016. We were excited to learn that Brandon had 3 possible donors!We were confident and excited as Brandon went in for his 7th bone marrow biopsy on January 19, 2016. We were crushed to learnthat his bone marrow cancer count had increased from 9% to 20% over the last month. While this was not the news we were hoping for, we were hopeful that the next highest dose of the trial drugwould do the trick. On January 20th, his doctors increased his medication dose to the highest possible dose of 60mg. Brandon's stem cell transplant was delayed to mid March in hopes that the medicationwould work its magic.Unfortunately, a week and a half later, on January 29, 2016, we learned thatthe medicationwasnot working. Increasing numbers of cancerous blast cells hadbegun to show in Brandon's blood, which lead doctors to believe that the leukemia was continuing to flourish in his bone marrow. Furthermore, the highest dose of the medicationwas starting to show toxic effects on Brandon's liver. With heavy hearts, Brandon's doctors were forced to remove him from the trial drug study.On January 29, 2016, we had the difficult conversationwith his doctors as theytold us there were no available treatment options left in Canada. Vancouver General Hospital is one of the leading leukemia treatment centers in Canada, and they had tried everything they have available to help Brandon. All they couldoffer, is comfort care to ease the side effects as the cancer takes over and eventually takes Brandon's life.Brandon and I are just not ready to quit. We are choosing to travel to the best cancer hospital in the United States, MD Anderson in Houston, Texas. Because Brandon is a Canadian citizen, this comes with a heafy price tag. His initial consultation fee is $37,000. I am working diligently to get all his paperwork in order so that he can be at MD Anderson to start treatment within the next few weeks. Since his leukemia is so aggressive, getting him to MD Anderson as quickly as possible is extremely important. Any donations receivedwill go towards paying for Brandon's treatment at MD Anderson.Anyone who knows Brandon, knows what a joy and light he is to the world. He is the most compassionate, generous, and contagiouslyfunny guy I know. He has the ability to light up the room and make everyone around him laugh and smile. He also has an incredible positivity and strength that comes from within. Throughout this journey, he has never complained or been angry with his diagnosis. I don't know how many times I've heard him say ""Other people have it worse, I'm the lucky one."" He has continued to fight leukemia with a smile on his face and love in his heart.Brandon is also my best friend, my husband, my soulmate, and my life-long love. I can't imagine aworld without him in it. I will never give up on a healing miracle, or on the hope that there is a treatment out there that can cure his leukemia. Wemade our wedding vows on October 18, 2015, and those vows willcarry on forever. I will always be there to love, support, cherish, and fight for him; whether itbe in his fight against leukemia or anything else that life throwsour way. I will never give up on him.I am beyond thankful for the love and support that we continue to receive from our family and friends. I don't know what we would have done without you all.Please help support Brandon in his fight to beat leukemia. Any money received will go towards funding his treatment at the award winning MD Anderson cancer hospital in Houston, Texas. The initial consultation fee is $37,000, but that only covers the initial doctor's evaluation and diagnostic tests. I don't know how much his full treatment will cost, but I will do everything I can to make sure that a lack of money will not prevent him from getting the care he needs. There is no price tag on Brandon's life.Brandon's only hope for treatment and a possible cure is to leave Canada to receivetreatment in the United States. Please donate and share help us make that happen.Even during the fight with one of the most aggressive form of leukemia, AML, Brandon keeps his spirits up by laughter, joking, and dancing. Laughter is the best medicine!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Always humor. She is magnetic, a friend to all, old or young, or having just been introduced.Darcy continues to face a feat that is unimaginable. Each day she is doing everything to overcome cancer, while her family provides all care possible to ease her discomfortsgiving great attention to what she can eat, to immense emotional support, or covering the many miles for her treatment. Words cant convey the severity Darcy and her family are facing, or the intensity of Darcys illness. As of a few months ago, she had cancer in multiple places throughout her bodyshe underwent chemo, and also needed full brain radiation after suffering multiple seizures because the cancer had spread. Most recently, it has been determined there are new spots on Darcys heart, among other places. Those who know Darcy can vouch to her strength, as an individual, daughter, partner, sister, mother, friend she is an admirable, courageous force. The Blethens are determined and are not giving up hope. They are scheduled to fly with Darcy to Austria for treatment at the Kleef Integrative Oncology Center this coming week. And despite the incredible community support, Darcys family has had to take many days from work to be with her throughout her care, and if not with Darcy, their daughter, Sydney. The bills insurance will not cover are mountainous, and beyond what anyone should have to consider while going through such an exhausting struggle. It is a very stressful hardship. Lets all donate somethinganything, so that Darcy can afford the chance of health. Most importantly, so she and her family can do so with as little stress possible. And if anyone should face a miracle, it is this amazing woman and her family. Donate and lets bring Darcy home from Austria healthy. The Blethen family is endlessly grateful.

EDS Siblings 3&5 need surgery in US,"$19,426 ","$170,000 ",Medical," May 25, 2015",198,16,Brantford,ON,1300,4,17,"                            Chantelle Willson                                                                                                                   Brantford, ON                                Brodie is a 4 year old boy born with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a rare genetic condition for which there is little medical understanding and no cure. EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders. The collagen in the bodies of people with EDS is faulty. Collagen is the 'glue' that holds your body together and provides tensile strength to body parts like skin, joints, muscles, ligaments, blood vessels and internal organs. The faulty collagen does not provide enough strength to properly support body structures in a person with EDS, therefore Brodie suffers with daily chronic widespread pain, gastrointestinal issues, joint laxity, easy bruising, subluxations (joints that partially dislocate that can cause nerve impingement), trouble regulating his internal body temperature, chronic fatigue and on occasion causes feelings of aggression because he doesn't ever get a break from his pain and EDS symptoms.On top of it all, Brodie has been experiencing symptoms of a tethered spinal cord that is causing neuro-physical and neurological challenges on top of pain. As most people that know me realize, as Brodies mom, I also have a diploma in nursing so while I am not an expert by any stretch of the means, I do have the training to recognize when something is wrong. Last year, we attended a McMaster University Canadian Medical Education conference for EDS. It was there that we met Dr. Petra Klinge from the USA who presented on tethered cord in EDS. Dr. Klinge is a neurosurgeon who specializes in complex spine cases. We have tried to see specialists here at home but all our concerns have been dismissed after long wait lists. Desperate, we recently took Brodie to see Dr. Klinge in the USA. Dr. Klinge confirmed a severe tethered cord and a small nodule cyst against his spinal cord where it is tethered. He requires surgery from this skilled neurosurgeon urgently to protect against irreversible tissue and nerve damage. Sadly, we do not have access to a neurosurgeon in Ontario. This is confirmed by McMasters innovative patient included conference focused on bridging gaps in diagnostic and treatment criteria for EDS. We must head to Rhode Island for Brodies surgery, which is scheduled on June 17th. Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column. It is like a rubber band stretching causing Brodie so much pain and pressure. Brodies tethered spinal cord syndrome went undiagnosed until his pain, sensory & motor problems, and loss of bowel and bladder control emerged....requiring his immediate need for surgery. Brodie suffers daily with leg weakness where Ontario specialists only offer is to prescribe the use of a wheelchair and his incontinence is worsening by the day (changing his clothes 5 + times a day). We are desperately seeking comfort and a better quality of life for our son.Here is where you come in - We are asking you to please help contribute to this highly necessary yet very costly surgery. Our costs are estimated at $50,000 for this surgery. Please, if you can help out in any way, it would mean so much to all of us but especially Brodie.Please share with your friends and family and help Brodie so he can have a better quality of life. Thank you so much for taking the time to read his story and for helping in any way you can.We are also setting up a Trust Account for Brodie at the TD CANADA TRUST and will provide an update post here in case you would prefer to donate directly that way. Again, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.Paul & Chantelle Willson+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Actually when I think about it- I met Bill on the same day I met Bailey (cute electricians we hired to put up lighting in our gallery) 18 yrs later we have watched Bill always work hard and give back to our community- with the late night repairs and early morning calls to help out all the retailers stay open for business. I know from the other side of things when money was tight for Bailey and I - Bill aways had work for Bailey and was able to help us get thru rough patches. Last year when Martha had a debilitating skin issue and job loss we prayed alot for them and took in Marmalade the kitty. Getting reunited with Bill and Martha has been such a blessing. Our kids have enjoyed the friends in and out of our home as well as visits with Marmalade the cat. I can say this with full disclosure that Martha and Bill are the quintessential Good People and all of their friends I know can say the same. Two months ago when Bill had a routine colonoscopy which found stage 3 colorectal cancer, This was to say the least very difficult news. Bill with full support has decided to use a non traditional type of treatment for his cancer. His high deductible health insurance policy has only covered a fraction of his scans so far and most likely none of his alternative treatments. We would love to see him be able to have the option to go to a cancer treatment center in Scottsdale Arizona called the American Center for Biological Medicine or the Paracelsus Clinic in Switzerland for a 3 week treatment. These Clinics both cost between $29,000-$39,000. Most importantly not have the day to day stress of medical bills and work to contented with. He truly needs the opportunity to make his recovery a priority. The initial loss of salary last year from Marthas health issue as well as Bill's diagnosis has been unforeseen and difficult. Lets come together as a community and help Bill out, I know they would do the same for us. Thank you for any amount you can give!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"
Save Baby Leonardo,"$207,916 ","$400,000 ",Medical," September 4, 2014","2,730",25,Anthem,AZ,34000,27,11,"                            Leonardo Melo                                                                                                                   Anthem, AZ                                When Leonardo Melo Sabag was born, we thought he was a perfectly healthy little baby. After 9 days of being born we took him to his first visit to the pediatrician since he was showing signs of discomfort and we were immediately referred to the pediatric cardiologist where they detected a murmur in his little heart. That day was when the cardiologist gave us the saddest news we could ever imagine, that our baby was born with a congenital heart defect. He was diagnosed with:Congenital Mitral StenosisTricuspid valve with insufficient moderationSevere arterial pulmonary hypertensionHipoplastic aortic arc without obstructionThat same day he was hospitalized and his condition worsened since his heart was not pumping enough oxygen rich blood out of his lungs and also causing his lungs to fill up with blood. All this time he could have been receiving treatment, but this was not detected at birth and would not have corrected the heart defect. Now at only 3 months, our little angel has been hospitalized numerous times including a trip to the ICU. A group of 10 cardiologists in Arizona have given Leonardo a minimal chance of survival unless he has surgery soon due to the amount of stress being caused to his heart and lungs. Along with his worsening condition and the potentially deadly heart defect, the possibility of surviving is limited without receiving urgent attention which involves surgery. This type of surgery requires a mitral valve replacement or reparation as soon as possible which is delicate for a child that is less than a year old. As our son grows, he will require further open heart surgeries to replace the valve as the heart grows as well, which is also a concern and worrysome. As parents, we can't stand around and cross our arms and allow the situation worsen as the symptoms become more advanced as this is a progressive congenital disease. We've looked for every possible solution to save our baby and fortunately, we've found the one option that can keep our baby alive and that is two Pediatric Cardiologist Surgeons in Boston who specialize in this type of infirmity, who have performed this procedure in children who are less than a year old.Leonardo requires urgent attention due to the high levels of stress being placed on his lungs and the additional life threatening symptoms being caused by the mitral valve defect. Doctors Emani and Doctor del Nido from Boston Children's Hospital possess the knowledge and experience that our baby requires as they've performed similar operations on babies only a few days old. They are also known for using a new valve/process called the 'Melody Valve', which they are responsible for creating. The Melody Valve, can be expanded along with the growth of the child and their heart simply by means of using a catheter in the child's artery without having to intervene with multiple open heart surgeries. The Melody Valve procedure has only been performed by these two doctors and this is currently being done at Boston Children's Hospital. Both doctors have reviewed Leonardo's prognosis and are both in agreement that the baby requires 2 procedures, one to perform a cardiac catheterization to assess the heart and the pressure in the lungs and then follow up with a surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve. We are reaching out for help since Leonardo doesn't have insurance.We are seeking help from anyone who is willing to help our son, Leonardo in receiving this life saving procedure. Our son is a survivor and has a strong soul which has kept him pulling through on a day by day basis to stay alive!

Its always difficult to ask for help. That being said, sometimes circumstances being what they are...you have to admit you cant do it alone, pray and just ask.What started out with a small lump two months ago, has turned into two surgeries, a lumpectomy, mastectomy and repair to damaged skin surrounding. Annette has aggressive breast cancer. She will start chemo Aug 15th, every two weeks, for 16 weeks. There will be a follow up visit and shot after each treatment. As soon as she is strong enough, she will have her second mastectomy. She is in good spirits and determined to not let cancer win. Pete has had to forgo any opportunities to work. Countless doctor visits and changing her drains and bandages and making sure Annettes needs are met 24/7 have thrown him into the role of caregiver. A nurse comes in once a week to check on them but it is Peter carrying the load, the heavy responsibility. Their healthcare insurance is minimal, almost nonexistent, as is the case with many musicians. Theres no FMLA nor compensation for this huge undertaking and his being away from the working world. They have depleted their savings and the stress is taking a toll emotionally, as you can imagine....and they have only just begun to fight this battle. Thank you for taking the time to read this devastating news, and if you are able to help, in any way, no words will be able to describe their humble gratitude.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

My father is in South America ( Colombia ), and we all have this feeling that he is keeping up with his suffering and trying to resist just to make time for me and my daughter Gigi who is ten years old and is his only granddaughter, to be next to him so he can find peace.My father had a very hard life and lonely childhood and we are the only family he ever had ( my mother, sister, Gigi and me ), he is a hard worker father, loving and caring, always making jokes and a humble person always helping those around him, full of energy and strength; this illness is consuming him day by day in a way that is even hard to recognize him anymore of how weak and skinny he looks.Traveling expenses from Florida to South America plus passports for my daughter and myself is something I can't afford right now, but it may be the last chance we have to hug my dad and be with him. Our goal is to raise money for my daughter and myself to be able to travel to Colombia to see my daddy and to get our family together next to him as soon as possible, before is too late. I am a single mother with low income, my daughter's father passed away 3 weeks ago and obviously he won't be able to help with her expenses to travel to be with her abuelito, as she calls him, for the last time. This would mean the world to us and also to my family and to my dad, who is very depress and suffering a lot with this illness. Please help us reunite with my dad before he leave us. We are very thankful for this opportunity to share our story and raise the money we need to travel and for the people who decide to help our family to come together to say goodbye to my dad.Anything helps!

Operation for Marine Corps Veteran,"$1,550 ","$15,000 ",Medical," September 11, 2016",14,14,PORTSMOUTH,NH,58000,,6,"                            David Gold                                                                                                                   PORTSMOUTH, NH                                                        Greetings! My doctor says that I should have this operation as soon as possible, because the unwanted ""thing"" is getting larger and more invasive. This is a men's reproductive health issue, and I am sure you understand the need for privacy in this situation, hence I would rather not get too specific here. I was evaluated two months ago, and I have been dealing with this situation for many years. It took quite a bit of time to find out the costs - the doctor has his fee, the anesthesiologist charges his fee, and the hospital charges a fee for use of the facilities. The doctor is a retired U.S. Navy doctor, and he would very much like to help me before he retires. I trust him. The problem started in 1980 when I was in the Marine Corps due to a severe hazing incident. Without getting too graphic, I was kicked in the private parts violently, among other things. The culture back then was to simply suck it up and not complain, so I have not. I have kept quiet about it all these years. I love this country and I am just as patriotic as ever. Dealing with this medical condition has been harder and harder. At first it seemed to be OK, but lately it has really flared up. I drive a lot between jobsites, and it is getting increasingly difficult to deal with the pain, swelling and aggravation, not to mention the many unwanted side effects. It has had a huge effect on my self-esteem, my appearance and my ability to function. I have spent many hours at the VA hospital to no effect. Unfortunately for me and other veterans, that is a mostly broken system. My condition is slowly getting more severe by the day, and I do not have any more time or mental energy to deal with the VA.Raising money for this operation means a lot to me because I anticipate a full recovery and I will enjoy becoming a fully productive member of society again. I should follow my doctor's advice to have it taken care of as soon as possible. If you want details, I may be able to share that if I can maintain my dignity and privacy. This is a medical condition that if left untreated only gets larger and larger.  Since I own my own business which is a sole proprietorship, I do not have any other source of income. I love what I do, and my customers love my work. If they knew that I was dealing with this, I am sure they would want to help. I do not drink (except for the occasional beer), do not smoke, I eat healthy, and exercise regularly, so you may feel better about contributing because I am otherwise very healthy. It is not money that will be going down the drain as far as my overall health is concerned. I have never reached out for fundraising, and in my daily life I do give to multiple small charities along the way. I practice an ""attitude of gratitude"" every day, and I would feel gratitude beyond measure for any help you can provide. Since this conditon is worsening, there is a sense of urgency about this. Thanks!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Their families who simply don't know what to do, can wait years for even a diagnosis.Our national Awareness Week is the first week of October each year and this year I took on being its first national coordinator. The hours are long and the pay is zero and I feel more fulfilled and moved by the opportunity of this position than I could describe in words.My commitment is to create awareness for hope for sufferers, families, carers and anyone who is affected.The impact of a successful campaign will be massive for people who really need it.There are many people who make a difference in supporting Australians who deal with BPD.Do you want to be someone who helps make a difference?I am based in WA and we have received so much support from businesses and people here. So many are giving so much time and resources to make this Awareness Week successful from all around Australia. We are about to run this campaign on zero funding and it will be effective to an extent and with your support the reach and impact of this awareness campaign will be significantly magnified withthe funds being used for Facebook advertising, Social Media and Public Relations.As this Awareness Week is October 1st to 7th we are urgently seeking donations.All that goes into this will be worth it even if we help one family let alone hundreds of thousands.The question is, do you want to be someone who makes a difference to a lot of people ?                    + Read More"

First, thank you for stopping by. Thank you for looking at the crazy assortment of pictures and my somewhat rambling video.My name is Laura, and my family and I need your help in a bad way. I actually don't like asking for help, let alone needing it. It's not a pride thing. It's more of ""I know I'm not your problem"" thing. But, I've also learned the value of family, friends, and community - and that family isn't always blood, friends are God's gift to humanity, and community isn't always the place you live, and there alone.For those of you unaware of our story, my daughter Janet passed away 7 months ago after a 3 year journey and battle with brain cancer. Her cancer was literally one of a kind, and came with many unknowns and uncertainties.I tell you that, not to make you sad, but rather to share a little of the why we are in the position we are in. During what became precious time, my husband lost his job with Boeing, and I was not employeed because of the need to be available 24/7 and attached at the hip with St. Louis Children's hospital.Anyway, to the heart of the matter.We've recently discovered a drain (the main drain) in our basement was backed up. Our home air conditioner unit was working as it should. Condensation draining into said backed up drain.Enter dramatic music.So yeah, it flooded, and created a slimy, grimy, sludgy mess. No joke. So, we had to connect with a service that deals with flood restoration, which led then to them also dealing with mold remediation.Thank the Lord, we do have good homeowners insurance. The flooding stuff is pretty well covered. So far, we anticipate no gaps (other than our $500 deductible) that we'll owe. Then, there is the mold issue. There is a mold remediation coverage in our policy. Frankly, it seems generous at $2500. So far, and this doesn't include the need to now re-do some areas because the mold was in more areas than anticipated (courtesy of the HVAC system transporting mold to the entire house. With the parts in the basement alone to get it as mold free as it can be, we have now a deficit of roughly $750. Add to that, the $5-10K in additional funds that will have to come out of pocket - well, not sure how that's going to work out. It isn't safe for us to be there until the mold remediation is complete, and air quality tests repeated to verify an acceptible level of mold. (Some mold is normal, okay, and not going to kill you.) But, when it is significantly higher than normal, and than the outside air, it's then that you have a problem. We're there.There is also something called mycotoxin testing that each member of our family needs. Insurance will cover some, but because it is in depth and not a normal necessity - then it isn't fully covered. Our portion alone will cost nearly $2500. (bloodwork and urine testing)I don't tell you all these ""woe is me"" details for your pity, but rather to ask for your help. If, like me, money isn't your thing right now, would you please (PLEASE) consider saying a prayer for us, or sending positive energy - or whatever it is that you do in such a situation!? However, know this - every single dollar will help. Honestly, it's one more dollar than we know where is right now.NOW, if there is additional funding, I will be up front. It is needed beyond this particular crisis. My daughter, as I mentioned, passed away now 7 months ago. Her medical bills are still present, still waiting (patiently, or not) to get paid. We can't do it. We will, but it all takes time.In the event those needs are met as well, I will be donating additional funds in her honor and memory towards childhood cancer research, awareness, and support. I can provide a list of organization(s) who will benefit. I will also provide a donation in memory of friends and family affected by suicide. (This is suicide prevention / awareness month.) I will explain more on that one in time, if additional funds are raised.With any way you connect - through prayer or otherwise, know that you have our heartfelt gratitude.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Jessica has taken this diagnosis with grace and approached treatment with positivity and fervor, remembering that, through all of this heartache, there is a precious baby on the way.As a healthy, young, mother-to-be Jessica planned to breast feed her baby when he or she came into this world. When she was told by her doctor that this wouldn't be a possibility because of chemo and radiation treatments, Jessica was devastated. Of course, a healthy Mom and baby is the most important thing. But breastfeeding is something Jessica had been committed to and was excited about. Human breast milk is so important for all newborns, but especially for babies born before full term. Breastmilk provides babies with proper nutrients, protection from infection and supports long-term health. Formulas found in the US contain ingredients that Jessica and Ben just aren't comfortable with. Luckily, there are breastmilk banks that accept breastmilk donations from mothers who have an abundance of milk. These milk banks are equipped to provide safe breastmilk to mothers, like Jessica, who are not able to breastfeed their babies on their own. Not surprisingly though, milk bank milk is very expensive....up to $4 an ounce. With newborns eating up to 25oz in a day, it can cost up to $100 each day to feed a baby with breastmilk from a milk bank. Ben and Jessica feel incredibly fortunate to have jobs that provide health insurance which will cover much of the medical bills associated with cancer treatment. But insurance will not cover the cost of milk. We are asking for donations to help cover the cost of vital breastmilk that will provide Jessica and Ben's precious baby with a healthy start in this world.Armed with a plan, a strong and healthy marriage, a good dose of faith, supportive friends and family and an unwavering positive outlook, Jessica and Ben are fighting this horrible, heartbreaking disease tooth and nail. Every single dollar donated, every single ounce, is important and appreciated. Thank you for your donation and your support.- Colleen, Maureen, Amy, Andrea, Nathalie, Annie, Marissa, Katy, Darcee, Sarah, Sarah (a few of Jessica's oldest and dearest friends and her absolutebiggest fans)+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

At this time my mother is in a coma in Douala General Hospital, where she is not receiving the adequate medical treatment that she needs for hopefully, a full recovery. This is the time where our family needs all the support we can get, to get my mom back home. Our goal is to have her medically evacuated. The cost of a medical evacuation from Douala to Michigan is $130,000, plus we have a financial obligation to pay the hospital before she is released (with her being in a foreign country they do not accept American insurance, so this cost will have to come out of pocket). As many of you know, my mom would give her last penny to someone else in need. Now, unfortunately we need the help of others. Speaking for me and my four siblings, we all need my mom home and healthy. This is our goal.Over the past decade Sue Simmers has helped thousands of children, and adults with her efforts in Cameroon, Africa with building a school, bringing in people like yourself to assist in sponsoring children's educations, paying school fees for thousands, building a hospital, sending school and medical supplies, and so much more through Benekin Foundation (previously Wellspring of Hope). She also has given tirelessly here at home providing assistance to anyone she came across in need, including packing meals with her family and driving around and delivering them to homeless people in Detroit. Sue has always been the giver!! Please find it in your hearts to give back to someone that would do the same for anyone in need. All levels of donations are greatly appreciated, please do not go beyond your needs, that is not what my mom would have wanted. Your kind words and prayers would be a great support to the family right now.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She simply wanted to do a random act of kindness. To bring comfort to someone in need.....It was a warm September evening as she drove back from Ward, CO to return home. She ran across a few younger adults attempting to return home from a camping excursion that weekend and had been left stranded far from Boulder where they could catch a bus home. Katie being the generous, loving woman she is, invited them to a comfortable visit at her cozy cabin until they could rendezvous with the pickup vehicle. The rest is in the news...Katie Kulpa has been an incredible asset to every person she has ever run into. Shes a wonderful host in many ways with no shortage of smiles. Lots of laughter around the camp fire with libations and a 5-star meal cooked on a small woodburning stove to top off any visit!Katie was never a person to bring harm in any way to anyone she ever knew. She adores living in and being one with nature. She has lived without running water or electricity for 15+ years. She is more resourceful than most even 1/2 her age and at 71 years old, can still swing an axe!With the winter season coming on alongside a stack of unknown hospital bills, there is the obvious underlying question how much of this financial setback will be covered. This fund will assist in easing this financial shock to a woman whom barely leaves a footprint of any kind. Will assist in the purchase of firewood, food, fuel for her car, medical bills and the very basics of living expenses.Please, even $1 will help. With enough donations, we will easily reach our goal and with that comes piece of mind that we all have come together to do a random act of kindness to simply pay it forward.Thank you for your support!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She was born with Treacher-Collins Syndrome (TCS), which left her with significant bone deficiencies in her face. In her 20 years of life, she's undergone at least 36 surgeries, each to try to correct the effects of this rare congenital condition that affects breathing, eating, sight and hearing. The last set of surgeries in 2011 were intended to extend her upper and lower jaw to give her the ability to chew, breathe and talk without further medical intervention. Instead, the surgeries left her in severe facial pain.For 5 years now, we've searched far and wide for a solution to her debilitating trigeminal nerve pain - to no avail. Finally, after much study and prayer, we found an expert in peripheral nerve surgery who correctly analyzed the source of her pain, and has a solid plan to give her relief, so she can move forward with her college education and ultimate career as an American Sign Language interpreter. The problem we face is that this doctor does not take insurance. It puts us, as her parents, in a difficult position: we want to provide our sweet daughter with this important solution to her pain, but the cost is prohibitive. We've never had to ask for financial help until now. The surgery is scheduled for October 2016at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD. We have already purchased travel tickets, with faith that those whose lives have been touched by our dear Katie will help us gather the funds to pay for this very expensive surgery.Katie's indomitable spirit has always been an example to everyone who meets her. She loves life, and yearns to make a difference in this world. Getting relief from this long-lived nerve facial pain will go far to give her a fresh start on her goals to help others through a productive career of service. We thank you in advance for making this dream of a pain-free existence a reality. THANK YOU!- Glenn & Pam Whicker, Katie's parents+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Since Savannah was a young girl she has spent a large portion of her life in and out of hospitals and doctors offices, and has had to self-administer weekly and sometimes twice weekly subcutaneous IV immunoglobulin therapy treatments to give her the working components of an immune system. This has helped her live her life like most of us.Savannah has been attending college at Duke University to become a pediatric immunologist, to help children growing up with the same struggles shes had. Recently her immune system has taken a turn for the worse and these treatments are no longer going to be enough. Her doctor at Duke University has told her she must have a bone marrow transplant and that she needs to be prepared for the fight of her life. It will start with a grueling round of intense chemotherapy, followed by the bone marrow transplant. Savannah will have to be in isolation for a minimum of 3 months and will not be allowed to have any physical contact with anyone for quite some time. She will not have any means of covering even the most basic of living expenses as she will not be able to work during this time period. Your gift or contribution can greatly help my daughter in her time of need. I'm reaching out to all my friends and family to join me in helping assist Savannah in covering her not only medical costs, but also basic needs during this battle, ie: food, rent, and keeping the lights on. Having these necessities covered will allow Savannah to focus on the challenges of fighting the biggest battle of her life. Any donation you can give will be a blessing and we thank you for your help. If you arent able to financially assist Savannah, please keep her in your thoughts and prayers. I ask that you share this post on your Facebook to spread the word with your friends and family that might be able to help. Thank you so much, Robert Goodman.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

As we have for more than two decades, the BCCLA will stand with them.We are going to court to challenge the new legislation on assisted dying (Bill C-14), a restrictive federal law that violates the rights of suffering Canadians.But we cant do it without your help. We need to raise $25,000 to start work on this case. Donate now, to support compassion and respect for choice.The BCCLA is launching the legal challenge with Julia Lamb, a 25 year old B.C. woman who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure or effective treatment. Julia is free-spirited, creative and independent. She has a fulfilling job as a marketing assistant for a fashion company and a close network of friends and family. However, Julia must rely on her home care aides for assistance with all her daily living activities, including bathing, dressing, using the washroom and preparing meals. She experiences frequent pain from muscle contractures. She suffers from falls and repeated broken bones on account of severe osteoporosis. She has breathing difficulties. In the last couple of years, Julia has become more and more concerned about her declining health. She feels a shadow looming over her. She fears the worst possible version of her future  one where she suffers increased pain and discomfort, has difficulty breathing sufficiently well on her own, loses her independence and loses her ability to express herself. Julia wants the peace of mind of knowing that if her suffering becomes intolerable, she will have the right to seek medical assistance in dying. Show your support by donating today.The Supreme Court directed that medical assistance in dying should be available to people to like Julia. The court ruled that clearly consenting, competent adults with grievous and irremediable medical conditions that are enduring intolerable suffering have the right to medical assistance in dying. But the government of Canada has abandoned Canadians who had struggled for years for their right to compassion and respect for choice at the end of life. The new assisted dying law restricts access in medical assistance in dying only to those Canadians whose illness is terminal and who are near death.If Julias suffering becomes unbearable, she may become trapped in her body. She does not want to be forced to end her life through painful, violent or drastic means. She believes she should have the right to have a compassionate and peaceful death with a physicians assistance. The government claimed that taking people like Julias Charter rights away was a balanced approach. We know that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional. That's why we're standing with Julia and other seriously ill Canadians to challenge the law.But we cannot do it alone.When we won at the Supreme Court of Canada last year, we did not anticipate that we would need to re-litigate this issue. We are spread thin. We need your help to raise $25,000 to start working on this case.We can never know in advance exactly what a case will cost, but you are making this case happen, so we want to be upfront and transparent with you. Ourincredible pro bono lawyer team is working for free, but we still need to raise funds for a whole range of legal costs such as court filing fees, court reporters, public education, trial transcript fees, photocopies and travel for experts and witnesses. The costs quickly add up.Were a small team, unaffiliated with any other organization in the country. We exist, and are able to do our work, only because of the generous donations of our supporters.We need your help today. Please donate. Please share your personal experiences with us. If you are a critically ill Canadian who would like access to medical assistance in dying but you, too, have been left behind; please let us know if you are interested in helping this case.

I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2008. Statistically, I had a less than 8% chance of survival and yet today, years later, remain completely cancer free! After facing, fighting and overcoming cancer, I am compelled to reach out to patients facing similar challenges that I encountered in my fight against cancer. Even though my husband had spent over 20 years in the wellness industry, we found it extremely difficult to find reliable resources to heal the whole person, particularly as it related to cancer. We established Believe Big in 2011 to help families navigate their own cancer journey by providing the tools and resources they need to advocate for their own health.Believe Big provides a wealth of current cancer-fighting information in one place. Patients and families can download several helpful resources including:1. First Steps to take when first diagnosed2. Key questions to ask oncologists3. A nationwide directory of Naturopathic Experts who are trained to boost immune function.4. Resources to assist patients in becoming their own advocate5. How to win the mental war and eliminate fearWe are NOW in the beginning stages of developing a Mistletoe Clinical Trial in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Hospital! This trial is a huge step forward because it brings the conventional and complimentary medical communities together. At Believe Big, we have seen tremendous benefits of Mistletoe Treatment with ALL types of cancer! Mistletoe treatment is used widely in Germany and Switzerland and until a clinical trial is done here in the United States, it can not be offered as standard of care. You have the opportunity to help us fund this ground breaking trial and make it available to patients here! Because Mistletoe is a natural substance and there is not a patent possibility, pharmaceutical companies will not fund this trial. Therefore all funding will need to be through philanthropic and private donations. As one of the researchers shared, ""this trial is exciting because it has the potential to change the way cancer is thought of and treated.""We have lost too many sisters, brothers, mothers and fathers to cancer. Will you help us in our fight to fund this trial and help to save many lives? Any and all donations are appreciated and are tax deductible.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"
Damian Creed's Cancer Fight To Win,"$31,348 ","$50,000 ",Medical," July 15, 2015",385,14,NAPLES,FL,2500,3,7,"                            Sarah Hancock                                                                                                                   NAPLES, FL                                                                                On May 25, 2014, we heard the words no parent should ever hear, ""Your child has cancer."" Damian was diagnosed with advanced retinoblastoma and a rare vascular proliferative disease. His retina had fully detached and he lost all vision in the left eye. He underwent 7 rounds of IAC (intra arterial chemotherapy) and was said to be in a maintenance stage, where his doctor felt he could use laser to calcify the remaining tumor. At his last EUA (exam under anesthesia) on June 5, 2015, all was still good and the tumor was under control. He had higher pressures in the eye and his drops were adjusted to try and help this. We were told to have an MRI done before his next EUA August 21. But things quickly changed. I noticed little things, the color of the tumor had changed, and Damian had become increasingly sensitive to light. He didn't want us to open the blinds in his room and was always wearing a baseball hat, even inside the house. We had been in contact with his eye doctor regarding these changes and his drops were changed again, thinking this would help. But on Sunday night, June 28, 2015, Damian was in pain. After calling the on-call doctor, we were advised to be in Miami at their office at 7:30 when they opened. We were sent home, to return the next day for an emergency EUA, which showed extensive bleeding within the eye. The eye could no longer be saved and it was time for it to be removed. An MRI the following day showed inflammation behind the eye and a dilated optic nerve, caused either from edema or tumor progression, but the scan of the brain was clean. After removing his eye on July 2, 2015, Damian is adjusting ok, but it is hard. We are still awaiting pathology reports regarding whether the cancer is spreading or if he is cancer free. But we have a whole new expense now. As many of you know, I (mom) lost my job in March, so Damian lost his medical insurance. I have been able to purchase a policy for him through United Healthcare but we have a monthly premium and new deductibles and copays and out of pocket expenses. And now we have a prosthetic eye to pay for. On average, he will need a new eye every 6 months as long as he is growing. WOW. Insurance will pay some, not all, of this, as they consider it cosmetic. He will still be followed monthly for EUAs, to be sure the cancer isn't spreading and that the remaining eye is healthy. He will be followed for life by his eye and oncology team. We need your help, we are just trying to get by and do what is best for our son. It has been a real struggle for him, how do you explain to a 3 year old that his eye had to be removed? We have told him that he has a boo boo eye and he seems to understand that a little, but it has been an adjustment period for sure. Thank you for your support from the bottoms of our hearts.Sarah, Ron, and Damian                                            + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

This GoFundMe campaign is to help Ben, Cyndi and Finn with their living and medical expenses as they navigate the long road to Bens recovery.On August 9th, while at a pool with his family for their friend's wedding in Jackson Hole, Ben was involved in a tragic diving accident. The results were devastating. The impact burst one vertebrae in his back while fracturing three others. He also suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), needed nine staples to close a deep head laceration, and his fifth rib was broken. Friends were able to pull Ben from the pool and he was rushed via ambulance to the ER in Jackson Hole. Ben was hospitalized and cared for in Jackson Hole at St. John's Medical Center for almost a week before being allowed to return to Salt Lake City for additional care.Ben is on a long and uncertain road to recovery, but thankfully, he has help. Currently, a number of specialists are treating his traumatic brain injury. There are also teams of physical and occupational therapists, spinal surgeons, and orthopedic specialists guiding the process of ensuring that Ben's back heals as quickly and properly as possible. This means that Ben is confined to a metal back brace and cant complete, or needs help with completing, most normal daily activities. His doctors are also doing their best to manage the constant pain that he is experiencing. Due to the TBI, doctors are taking a number of steps to help treat the negative effects that the brain injury has on Ben's everyday life. This includes removing anything that may over-stimulate Ben, since too much stimulus can cause additional brain damage and/or slow the healing process. Sadly, this means that the doctors have recommended that Finn stay with a friend or relative instead of his own home for the next few months. Doctors are also uncertain how long it will be before Ben is physically and mentally able to return to work. This has been a particularly tough year for the Meszaros. In addition to Ben's injuries, Cyndi was in the ICU in March for two weeks due to serious complications caused by her congenital heart defect (Cyndi has an artificial Mitral heart valve and takes blood thinners daily), and Ben's car was stolen from outside their home in June and has yet to be recovered. The Meszaros family has always been a source of encouragement and help for their friends and family. Needless to say, the Meszaros family is in need of our support and its time to give back.Well keep this page updated as Ben progresses, and we're hopeful that he will make a full recovery. Your support and generosity will help to cover the mounting medical bills, living expenses, and additional financial burdens that have been placed on the Meszaros family as a result of this accident. Any donation means the world to Ben, Cyndi and Finn and is extremely helpful. Thank you!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Joe Frank Medical & Recovery Fund,"$103,805 ","$100,000 ",Medical," January 11, 2016","1,053",8,LOS ANGELES,CA,5300,35,49,"                            Michal Story                                                                                                                   LOS ANGELES, CA                                In mid-December 2015, my husband, Joe Frank, became ill. This is one in a long list of medical issues he has faced since he was born, beginning with corrective surgeries for clubbed feet between the ages of 3 and 5. He's survived cancer three times - the first time, he was given three months to live when he was just in his early 20s. Since then, he's had numerous hospitalizations and surgeries for a host of issues. Ten years ago, he suffered from kidney failure and was on dialysis for a year-and-a-half until he received a kidney donated by his cousin. In addition, for years, he's been enduring and managing pain caused by severe scoliosis of his spine. I cannot express how much I admire Joe's courage and will to live. He has heard bad news on many occasions yet possessed the strength, courage and had the good fortune to beat the odds.I long for that outcome now. Forgive me for not providing details about what has taken place in the last month. I am in a condition of overwhelm. I've watched Joe face a myriad of diagnoses in the last month which has included sepsis, heart attack and pancreatic cancer.  At midnight on New Year's Eve, we were in the ER at Cedars-Sinai hospital with a dear friend and one of Joe's doctors (who left a party to be with Joe.) It was surreal to see the high-spirited celebrations on television bringing in the new year while in an emergency room hospital setting. Until last month, Joe worked daily: posting on Facebook, recording material for his next radio program, and preparing notes for future projects. It is my deep hope and longing that he will return to that work. It gives him meaning and profound pleasure. I think some of his latest programs are among his best work.  I dearly wish to see him come home with all of these medical issues resolved soon so that he can begin recuperating.When he does come home, however, he will be on IV medications which are not covered by insurance. The last time he returned from the hospital for a treatment of IV fluids, our out-of-pocket costs were $1500.00. That was for just five 5 days' worth of medication. This time, he will receive an IV cocktail for a month at minimum. *update 3/12: Joe was on TPN for 6 weeks. What we thought would be $350 a day is in reality nearly $1,000 per day. (Total = approximately $42,000 which includes the ""equipment"" - IV pump, saline and heparin syringes, gloves, etc.) The catheter remains in place in case he needs to go back on TPN. The equipment, however, continues to be delivered weekly to keep the line flushes - that is about $1,000 per week. Hopefully, the catheter will be removed soon since Joe is beginning to gain weight again.) We will need to hire someone to attend to him full-time since he is physically compromised. We don't yet know how long that will lastor exactlyhow much that will cost. We understand that it will take a minimum of 6 weeks and conceivably several months before he gets his physical strength and mobility back. (Today, 1/13, my research shows it could be a breathtaking $200,000if we have to hire someone full-time for a long period. Again Joe is committed to becoming strong again as soon as possible)*update 3/16: After a few physical therapists have come and gone, we finally found Doug. He is fantastic. He's helped Joe to walk much sooner than anyone expected. Doug comes here twice a week. Because of the outstanding progress, we only needed to hire someone part-time - and for assistance for just two months. That totaled only $1500.00 (plus equipment .)Ongoing: Out-of-pocket cost for Joe's usual medications and insurance payments is $10,000 to $12,000 per year. He's had medications added to his daily regimen and he now takes 24 pills a day. We haven't yet received the paperwork from Medicare RX or Medicare Part B (some meds are partially covered by Part B), listing the final out-of-pocket.Joe's income is based on his work for Unfictional . There was a time when he could produce up to four shows a year, which barely managed to pay the bills. But now our financial security is threatened. Joe is eager to get back to work, but requires sufficient time and care to do so.Each month over the past 2 years, we are short by about $2,000 to pay bills. (This is no exaggeration.) We live by a strict budget, continuing to draw on savings to get by. Faced with what we know we need to do in order to help Joe get well, we would easily run through those savings quickly. I cannot express how much it would mean for me personally to have Joe fully recover and resume his daily activities. I miss him every moment that I am home trying to ""take care of business."" I spend every night at the hospital and in the worst way wish I could give him some of my good health to help him through this.  We sincerely appreciate whatever support you can provide.Update Jan 30: We are just beginning to receive Medicare notices for how much out of pocket we can expect to pay. But the only notice we've seen so far reflects just the doctors' appointments and tests for the week before the hospitalization - that is close to $2,000.In the hospital, Joe was seen daily for a month by his primary doctor, an infectious disease doctor, three GI doctors, a hospitalist, an oncologist, and a cardiologist. Every day he had blood drawn and tested. He had a slew of other tests that I couldn't keep track of.He also now has two new medications that are close to $1,000 per month for both. *Update 3/15: I've been working with Medicare Part B and Joe's Medicare Supplemental. Joe is eligible for a price reduction since these medications are imperative for his survival.*For more about who Joe Frank is, and details (see the ""News"" page) that led to this hospitalization see his web site here. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Those plans came to a screeching hault a few nights ago. While Tyler was visiting a friend's new apartment in Alton, Illinois, he and two others stepped out on to a fire escape platform, which collapsed underneath the three of them. They fell approximately 25 feet to an asphalt alley. Tylerlanded on his head, suffering severe head trauma and multiple skull and facial fractures. Immediately after, he was airlifted to Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. He is currently in a medically induced coma in the ICU, with an unclear future ahead. Tyler has always been a leader in our family, even through the death of our Dad in 2012, he was a rock for my Mom and me. He was, and hopefully will continue to be a leader and a shining star in countless peoples' lives. Although everyone's thoughts and prayers have been a tremendous blessing to me and my family, Tyler still needs your financial support in his fight to pull through this extremely difficult time. My brother has changed so many lives in his 22 years with us, and we all plan for him to continue that for many years to come.Please help me bring our shining star back into the spotlight where he belongs, so he can keep performing and making us proud. I don't know what I would do without my big brother guiding me in everything I do.Our entire family thanks everyone who has reached out to us in the past few days. We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers we have recevied, and the many more to come. Thank you so much for your support.To read the full story on the events that unfolded after the accident and to get updates on Tyler's progress, please visit our website  www"
Kyla's Fight With Leukemia ,"$65,145 ","$100,000 ",Medical," January 6, 2016",421,8,RENO,NV,1600,6,4,"                            Kali Smith                                                                                        on behalf of Shelby YorkeyRENO, NV                                                        The Yorkeys need our help!On December 8th the Yorkey family's whole life was turned upside down. Shelby brought 2 1/2 year old Kyla in to the doctor for what she thought was just a cold. Kyla had a bad cough and fever, and started to look really pale with low energy. At first the doctor thought the same thing, but at the last minute she decided to do a quick blood draw since Kyla was so pale. After the draw the doctor came back and told Shelby that Kyla's red blood count was extremely low (below blood transfusion level, which it NOT GOOD!). Because Leukemia was the first thing that came to the doctor's mind, Kyla was rushed to UC Davis Children's Hospital that night.Once she arrived at UC Davis, Kyla received 3 blood transfusions and had bone marrow drawn to determine if she actually did have Leukemia. The tests confirmed that it was in fact ""ALL"" (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) and they began treatment. She underwent surgery and a port was inserted in to her chest where she now receives blood transfusions, chemo, and has blood drawn. Since then she has also undergone LP (Lumbar Puncture) procedures to test her spinal fluid and to begin chemo through her central nervous system.Kyla just began phase 1 of her 2 1/2 year chemo treatment plan, and is currently required to stay in, or within blocks of the hospital in case of any complications. Her parents, Scott and Shelby, have had to rent a home near the hospital and Scott is communting to and from work, several hours away. Kyla is unable to have visitors because her immune system is so compromised, and she will be receiving weekly chemo treatments for the next several months. She is not permitted by her doctors to return home for the forseeable future, so this is going to be a very long road for her and her family. It is devastating to see such a bright and cheerful little girl dealing with an illness that she doesn't understand.Though there is no way to estimate the extent of Kyla's medical expenses, as you can imagine, they are going to be immense. The average cost of childhood ""ALL"" treatment alone can range from $55,000-$160,000 according to the US National Library of Medicine article foundhere. From hospital stays, to procedures and tests, to a rental home near the hospital, this is going to be a hardship no parent can ever plan for. Shelby and I have been friends for 20 years. Seeing her and her family going through this hardship has been incredibly difficult, and has inspired me to do whatever I can for them.Any amount of help is greatly appreciated, as our goal is to takesome of the burden off of the family so they can focus their energy on helping Kyla fight this huge battle.I will make sure to update this campaign as I receive current information from Shelby so we can all stand with Kyla and keep her #KylaStrongThank youfrom the depths of my soul. You have no idea how much your help will mean to me and to the Yorkeys!Sincerely,Kali SmithIf you would like to contact me directly regarding other ways to help, feel free to email me at the email address provided above.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I am Frank Navarros mom and am asked to write my story which is technically Franks story in order for me to start this fundraiser.When Frank was 17 he was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma, he was at stage 4 when he was diagnosed. Frank fought for 7+ years!! Yes that long. They threw every chemo agent treatment they had at that time into his body but the Hodgkins wouldnt go away.The medical field told us there was nothing left with which to treat him except possibily a 2nd stem cell transplant.Franks sister was tested and was a great match for her brother. She had to be given daily shots to increase her white blood count (which was very painful; not the shots but the growth of the white blood cells). While his sister was undergoing this - the doctors were essentially killing off Franks immune system at the hospital in preparation for the transplant.The 2nd stem cell transplant did work for 7+ years.Now Frank is happily married with a son and is facing this same horrific Cancer.After 7+ years he has just been diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma for a 2nd time in his life.He tells me its different now. He now has a wife and a son and that changes the game for him.When writing this I wanted to interject my own feelings, all I can say is Im barely able to breathe is the best way to describe this. I am trying to prepare myself for fighting mode so I can be strong for Frank, Nadine and Liam.Frank is a fighter! Always has been! He has the mental strength to get in the ring once again and fight; however he is a Chef and when he doesnt work he does not get paid.With Medical bills and loss of income facing the family heavily at this time I ask that you please give what you can to help.Thank you so much for taking the time to read Franks story.We ALL love you Frank so very much with all our hearts!                                                                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

In addition to AHC, she also suffers from seizures. AHC is a condition that will effect Emory her entire life. She is unstable when walking, primarily communicates without using words, and suffers from attacks of AHC. Despite these limitations, Emory is highly motivated to be independent, she is a social butterfly, and she almost always has a smile on her face! She is my hero!Emory has been experiencing more seizures. She has been known to escape and walk away from our home and recently escaped a near drowning event. These experiences could have been prevented or lessened with the assistance of a service dog. 4 Paws for Ability is an organization that uniquely trains each dog according to the child's disability. As you can imagine, the training and cost of the dog is not covered by insurance. All proceeds raised will go directly to purchasing the service dog and training our family to care for the dog. 4 Paws for Ability will not start training a dog for Emory until all funding is complete. For this reason, we need your help! It is crucial to Emory's safety and independence to have a companion and guard for her.Any parent wants to feel like they can keep their child safe, however, that has proved more difficult with Emory.Four ambulance rides, several hospital admissions, and countless hours of stress and anxiety as a parent would all be eased with the presence of a service dog in our life.

We are the parents of Trey. Trey's Story:In July while on vacation visiting family and friends in Ohio Trey started bruising. Those initial bruises kick started a number of trips to the hospitals in Ohio and Colorado. After multiple blood draws, different failed treatments, and finally bone marrow biopsy.

In a freak accident, his bike tire became stuck between the pavement and the grass, and he was propelled forward off of his bike. He hit the pavement head first, and cracked his helmet. Aaron was immediately knocked unconcious, and he remained in this state for an extended period of time. He was hospitalized with multiple fractures to his face, and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) due to the bleed on his brain.Aaron is the sole support of our family of 8. We are adoptive parents of 2, and the 5 children who reside with us are all 10 and under. Our eldest son is overseas on a study abroad program at the moment. Aaron will not be able to return to work for quite some time. More tests are being conducted within the next few weeks (an EEG and MRI) that will provide a better timeline, but right now, we havea window of 4-12 months. There is no estimate of how much Aaron will recover at this time. Aaron has regained most of his memories, but cognitively is closer to that of a child. He requires assistance with basic tasks, such as showering, shaving, and getting in and out of bed. He is a fall risk, and is unable to move beyond a slow shuffle.We are asking for the help of our community to help us bridge these months, where not only will we lose Aaron's income into our household, but we have immense medical debt now due to this accident. The follow up testing, meeting with specialists, vestibular therapy, and chiropractic treatments all carry additional fees, as well.In speaking with United Way, they spelled out our Hierarchy of Needs:1. Rent 2. Food 3. Utilities 4. Automobile.So in skimmingit down to the absolute necessities, and skipping out on monthly payments such as medical, student loans and such, we still come up approximately $2700 short per month.Aaron was not able to receive Short Term Disability, and we are in the process of applying for SSI/Disability from the federal government, but this is a lengthy process. We are pleading with you to help us bridge these few months, so that our entire family does not go under. We literally have nowhere else to turn, and ask for your generosity to help keep our family afloat during this time of crisis. And please, continue to send Aaron love, light, strength, healing. He needs all of it. Thank you so much, from all 8 of us.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Their world was turned upside down when baby Leo was diagnosed with a rare disease called Pompe. This is a rare genetic disease in which there is a deficiency of a certain enzyme that breaks down glycogen to form glucose. Glucose is necessary for muscle growth, especially in a persons heart and skeletal muscles. This is what is happening with Leo. He has muscle weakness and an enlarged heart and is fighting for his life. There is an enzyme treatment therapy that might help him and will be started on Friday, September 23rd. He was given a feeding tube and a port in his heart to receive the enzyme on Wednesday, September 21. He will be in the Hospital for at least a month. Anne and Denis have taken extended time-off work and will continue, so they can spend as much time as they can as a family. The stress of medical bills is something they should not have to worry about now. The goal here is to lessen this burden on them and to let them know that we care and will do whatever we can to help them out.We are hoping to spread the word and hoping that people will donate as they are able to help out the financial strain on Anne and Denis.

She suffers from a disease called Huntingtons Disease. Over the last 14 years I have painfully watched my wife of 28 years go from an amazing mother, wife and community volunteer to the person she is today. Now she is completely dependent on others for her daily needs, She has lost over 60 pounds since last November and is a daily challenge to get enough calories in her to keep from losing weight. Over the last 2 years I have sought after and applied for every conceivable service available but in the end I am alone to pay the $4000 per month for her care and medical needs. We have tried to have a pool of helpers but it just too hard as I work swing shift and trying to take care of her on my days off with sometimes only 3 hours sleep was unfair to Mary, She needs someone who can tend to all her needs. I now have a live-in caregiver who is very attentive and patient with Mary. We do get visits from Hospice 3 days per week for medical checkups and showers. Until now I have been quietly spending down my savings and 401K just to get by, for those who know me I tend to be private and it pains me to accept defeat and turn to my family and friends for help. My goal is to avoid a nursing home as long as possible as I think Mary deserves to remain at home with her loved ones. My nightmare doesnt stop here though as our 2 children are at risk as well as our grandson. If you can help great if not thats fine too, just share on your homepage with a little information of how we have touched your lives and we can spread the word of this horrible disease. Thank you all for your continued support and prayers. Please take some time to read about Huntington's disease. Huntingtons disease (HD) is a fatal genetic disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. It deteriorates a persons physical and mental abilities during their prime working years and has no cure. HD is known as the quintessential family disease because every child of a parent with HD has a 50/50 chance of carrying the faulty gene. Huntington's disease has a major emotional, mental, social and economic impact on the lives of patients, as well as their families. Many describe the symptoms of HD as having ALS, Parkinsons and Alzheimers  simultaneously. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 to 50, and worsen over a 10 to 25 year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Over time, HD affects the individuals ability to reason, walk and speak. In the late stage, the person with HD is totally dependent on others for their care. Choking becomes a major concern. Chorea may be severe or it may cease. At this stage, the person with HD can no longer walk and will be unable to speak. However, he or she is generally still able to comprehend language and retains an awareness of family and friends. When a person with HD dies, it is typically from complications of the disease, such as choking or infection and not from the disease itself. In all stages of HD, weight loss can be an important complication that can correspond with worsening symptoms and should be countered by adjusting the diet and maintaining appetite + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Recently my daughter Kylie was diagnosed with Chondrosarcoma, which is a cancer of the bone. In this case, the cancer is on her pelvic bone and is in an area they should be able to remove . As you know Kylie is a Sta- Home home health nurse and she may have even helped some of your family members. She is scheduled to have surgery on October 13 and will be at MD Anderson for 3 weeks and after that will be at home for several more weeks. The purpose of this campaign is to assist with medical and travel expenses as they stay at MD Anderson for 3 weeks. Themoney raised will help them with hotel, incoming expenses and food. With the operation coming up in 3 weeks, it would be great to have one less thing for them to worry about so Kylie can concentrate on getting better. Kylie is my second born and she has often been compared to my late mother, Marie Reynolds Clement by her close resemblance and her kind personality. My late dad, Clem Clement always said that Kylie Marie reminded him so much of my mother. It would mean a lot to me and the family for the help they would receive. This has been a tough couple of months for all of us and we thank God that with the accident that she had, the cancer was discovered when it otherwise would not have been. God works in mysterious ways and I have no doubt the He will heal her as a result.Thanks so much!Sammy                    + Read More"

This quickly developed into a ""Toxic Mega Colon"" that was about to rupture. After being hospitalized for 11 days, she agreed to the surgery that saved her life. Altogether, Linsey was ill for 27 days and hospitalized for 17. The surgery consisted of the complete removal of her Large Intestine, or Colon. This meant that Linsey had to have an ileostomy bag on her stomach to collect her waste, since she no longer had a colon.After a long road of recovery from the initial illness and surgery, Linsey is now able to get reconstructive intestinal surgery (J-Pouch Creation) that will eventallygive her the ability tohave somewhat normal bowel functions. This means the ileostomy bag will no longer be a cumbersome and frustrating experience for her, as it will be removed.Linsey's J-Pouch Creation surgery will be preformed at the University of Washington, on September 22nd, 2016. She will then have the third, and final surgery, at the end of December, to remove the ileostomy bag, when the surgery site has completely healed.The Wallace family has fair insurance coverage, but they are still responsible to pay 20% of the medical bills (hospital stay, surgery, perscriptions, etc...). With the sudden illness and medical bills from the last year, the family is still trying to recover financially.Any donations or financial contributions will be used to to cover medical bills and to pay for assistance for Linsey as she recovers.Any prayers, thoughts and kind words for the Wallace Family would be greatly appriciated during this time.Thank you for reading Linsey's story and for any prayer or financial support that you would like to give.God Bless,The Wallace FamilyMike, Linsey, Benjamin, Ariyanna and KayhlanLinsey Wallace is 35 years old and has been married to Mike Wallace for 14 years.

We need help financially and massive amounts of prayer. LOTS of prayers for babies but also for momma and daddy to stay strong through this. A lot of you know and Im sure a lot of you don't know the true, real, raw, details of what my family has been through this past month.I am devastated to see my brother and sister in law have to go through this. Having the twins premature is one thing but being airflighted to Salt Lake is another. Of course momma has to be there..but shouldn't dad be able to as well. Not only is Ashley taking this time off of work.. my brother has to stay home to work to provide financially for ALL the medical expenses as well as the unknowns of what the future is going to bring. It saddens my heart that he wont be able to be at their bedside every day.I wanted to put this together in the hops of raising money so my brother can fly every weekend to see his babies and his wife..and help relieve this HUGE burden of stress that we all know finances do.Im asking for your help to donate anything your heart feels you can give. No amount is to small. If you cannot donate please SHARE this. My HOPE and goal is to raise 40K that will be just a fraction of what my family is going to need to release the burden of debt.Please share my mission with your friends and family.Love, MorganFrom Ashley:At 2:00 AM on August 1, 2016 Kyle and I had the scare of a lifetime. At only 24 weeks my water had broke. We went into the hospital to confirm it really was my water that had broke, but I wasn't actually in labor. They decided to admit me and keep me on bed rest for as long as possible to keep our little babies in. The next day I was transferred from Billings Clinic to St. Vincent Healthcare due to having a better and more experienced NICU (when it came to preemies) - just in case.At 9:42 PM on August 6, 2016 Chase Michael Brano was born weighing 2lb 4oz and 13in long and at 9:44 PM Ryley Elaine Brano was born weighing 1lb 14oz and 13in long. On August 17, Ryley had to be flown down to Salt Lake City, Utah via help-flight for a life threatening perforated bowel. That night she had her first of three surgeries she would need to correct her bowel. On August 20, Ryley had her second surgery, where they had to remove a total of 6 centimeters of her bowels. Along with her bowel issues Ryley has had a history of chronic lungs (over inflated lungs, collapsed lungs, pneumothorax, and chylothorax). She has been on three different types of ventilators and we are so close, after almost 7 weeks, to finally getting her extubated. Ryley also has a grade 3 and grade 4 bleed in her little brain that seems to be stable and progressing in a good direction. Ryley was given the ""sickest kid in the NICU"" award down in SLC - which is not something any parent wants to hear. There were a few times the doctors didn't know whether or not she would make it through the night, but thankfully our little girl has proven time and time again that she is a fighter.During this time, Kyle stayed in Billings to take care of Chase, who was still in the NICU at St Vincent. After Chase was born the doctors were concerned that he may have meningitis. After multiple failed spinal tap attempts (to be able to retrieve spinal fluid to test for meningitis) they decided to give him a full course of antibiotics just in case. Chase eventually had developed bilateral inguinal hernias, that he will have to have surgery on to correct before he goes home. One night, Chase became very jittery and the next day they did an EEG to confirm he was having seizers. After a phone consult with a neurologist down in SLC they finally got him on anti-seizer medicine to help stop them. He continued to get better (with few to no seizers) and grow, and was even extubated and beginning to breath with less and less ventilation until 9/14/16 when he started acting sick and not his happy little self. During his routine head ultrasound on Friday, August 16, 2016 we found out that his ventricles had almost doubled in size. Later that night, Chase was flown via help-flight as well down to Salt Lake to be seen by their neurologists and neurosurgeons. It was not a life threatening flight like Ryley's, but he needed to be seen sooner rather than later so it wouldn't cause permanent brain damage. That night we had our kids together for the first time in almost a month, not under the circumstances that we would like, but our family was together in one place. The waiting game is one of the hardest parts of being a NICU parent, and the next two days with Chase were just that, waiting. After doing an MRI we were able to confirm that his ventricles were large, but we needed to make sure that he did not have an infection before they were able to do anything. Because the only way to check for meningitis is through spinal fluid, they were forced to do a ""tap"" on his ventricles on 9/20/16. They had to stick a small needle through his brain to his ventricles and pull back enough spinal fluid to be able to test it, as well as take some of the swelling off of his brain. They had taken out 18cc of spinal fluid and were able to determine that he did have some sort of infection, so he will continue to be on antibiotics. If his ventricles continue to grow, they will have to put in a reservoir in his brain to be able to drain the fluid and possibly a shunt before he goes home. Our kids continue to fight and prove to everyone that their drive and determination to go home happy and healthy is greater than anyone I have ever met. This entire process has been a full on roller coaster and we are not done yet. We have at least another two months down in SLC before we can even think about going back to Montana, but we are very hopeful that we will be home soon. Our little family cannot thank everyone enough for all of their love and support through this journey.   Love the Branos+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

He was struck by a dump truck while riding his bike in New York City at 3:30am on September 23, 2016. As a result his right leg from the knee down had to be amputated. Also, his left leg will require several surgeries to reconstruct it. He is fifty four years old and it will be a long and hard recovery. John is a Syracuse, New York native who currently works as a stage carpenter for Adele. He has toured the world for various stage and production companies since the age of nineteen. Some companies he has previously worked for are WWE, Mountain Productions, and Stage Co. John loved touring the world and was most in his element when surrounded by his work friends and showing his family what he does. One of his favorite past times was riding his bike and exploring every city he encountered. The kind donations will be used towards medical expenses and other necessary needs for his new life. Insurance will not be able to cover much of the expenses. Also, there is a large possibility that he will never be able to work again in his life. The medical bills and expenses that come along with such a substantial injury will be beyond our ability to pay. This means so much to all his family and many friends he has obtained over the years.

He has been diagnosed with autism and severe global delay. He recently began having epeleptic seizures, and we have been told that because he is still not walking, he has been diagnosed with atonic Cerebal Palsy and hyper mobility. He also has a fossa aracnoid cyst on his brain. Michael does not speak, crawl, or walk yet.The day cares will not care for him any longer because they do not want to be responsible of seizures. The day cares that accomodate Michael's needs and learning styles do not accept children until they are three. The few available day cares are not equipped to handle his special needs and do not have staff qualified to handle the situationif he should have a seizure. I am a school teacher and am taking an upaid family leave for 12 weeks to care for Michael. When my leave time is expired I do not have any one to care for him. I need my job for insurance purposes to pay for his many doctors which are a team. I am ineligible for sevices because I am part of the working class. I teach in an inner city school and my paycheck is minimal, I work for my health benefits.I would stay home and care for him myself if there was a way to stay afloat financialy but not at the cost of losing Michael's benefits. I have been in touch with SSI, Division of Disabilitied, BCBS and Medicaid as well as a Social Worker etc. All doors are closed to me.I am seeking funds to help me pay for a care giver qualified to administer CPR and take care of Michael's needs while I am at work. Any funds raised will go to Michael's care. I appreciate any help that you are able to give. Without continuing thespecial treatmentMIchael has been getting would create deterioration of his skills.

Jenis kind, genuine, thoughtful and selfless in so many ways. From her home life to her work life, on a daily basis she manages to take care of everyone around her inso manyways.Jen is aproud mother of three awesome kids! Well-mannered andfun to be around, it isobvious theapple doesn't fall far from the tree as they are a direct reflection of their beautiful mom.Despite the fact that Jen is a single mother with a busy schedule and until recently, a full-time job, Jen makes it a point to be involved in the community and tolove and motivate the people around her. One example of Jen's passion forhelping others is Pure Fit, the running group she founded in 2011. She combined her passion for running, focus on positive living, and love of helping others to create this group and take on the role of our running coachor more accuratelyour life coach! Many times she gives up getting her own miles logged so she can set up the route (which includes writing inspirational quotes on the sidewalk with chalk!), makes sure there are water stations throughout the run, and most importantly, she isthere at the finish line with a huge smile and a huge hug for each and every runner.Up until a few months ago, Jen was able to balance family life, work and friends and made it look easy!In May her youngest daughter underwent unexpected neurosurgery. Jen took time offfrom work to focus on taking care of her family and to be there throughout her daughters recovery. Unfortunately, time off from a commission based sales role equates to little to no income. Throughout this tough time Jen has managed to stay strong and positive.You stillfind her at the finish line, waiting with a huge smile and a huge hug and you can't help but be in awe of such a beautiful soul! Now, less than 4 months after her daughters surgery and on-going medical treatments, Jen receivedthe devastating news that she has aggresive breast cancer. All of us that know her and love her took the news very hard.. and guess who was there to comfort us? Jen!Pleasekeep Jenand her family in your thoughts and prayers.

It's a story that Christine Miserandino wrote that helps explain what living with Lupus or any other chronic illness is like. After having been asked what it was really like by a friend  Christine grabbed the nearest thing to her  spoons (she was in a diner after all) and gave them to her friend. Then she asked her friend to describe her day. Her friend made generalizations like  getting up to pee, brush her teeth, get breakfast. Christine broke it down for her  first she had to get her body moving in bed, then she had to stave off the nausea in order to walk to the bathroom. Breakfast  yea, she needed to eat something  in order to take her handful of pills, but what do you fix  and eat  when you have nausea and no appetite. Each of these tasks takes just a bit of energy  which adds up to spoons. The more she went thru the day  the more the spoons disappeared. Before the end of the day  the spoons were gone, and like I said  the day wasn't over. What do you do then? You can read the entire essay here:  http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/She wrote The Spoon Theory in 2003. Since then it has been read and translated all over the world  yup  all over the world. The Facebook page for Butyoudontlooksick.com/fb has over 1 million fans. The fans that are sick  well, we call ourselves Spoonies. Every day messages of thanks come to Christine for giving a way to explain the fatigue, the fog, the pain of being chronically ill. It fills Christine's heart to know that she's touched so many in such a meaningful way. One of her fave quotes is We rise by lifting others Robert IngersollThis is where the Spoon Lady is today  she has lost her beautiful smile. Everyday, she wakes, takes her medicines and puts on her beautiful smile for the world to see. The smile that says to the world  But I Don't Look Sick! But Christine has had a very difficult year  and she has lost the ability to put on the smile. It is gone. She has spent her life supporting the Spoonie community  reminding you that you're not alone. That she 'gets' it, that she's there for you.Along with ensuring we never feel alone in our journey, Christine is also a very real person with family a daughter a significant other and medical bills and medicines and everyday health issues that make life hard to live. Our very own Christine Miserandino, beautiful person and creator of The Spoon Theory needs a helping hand from her Spoonie Family. Here's why. Christine was due to deliver a beautiful baby girl named Charlotte in March of 2016. Instead, after suffering months of constant nausea and vomiting, and then weeks of renal failure and trying to keep the baby to term, on January 26 she had a c-section to deliver her stillborn daughter. Christine and her boyfriend Ned lost a daughter, Christine's daughter Olivia lost her little sister and Christine and Ned's parents lost their grandchild. Christine's words: ... I didn't even know what was going on at first and every time I. Would wake up and feel the pain of the c section, I would ask where my baby was and a nurse or Ned would have to explain all over again what happened. Ned lost a daughter too. Olivia lost a little sister. I was trying to take care of them. This heart breaking and soul crushing experience affected the whole Spoonie community too. Christine planned her daughters burial, instead of her homecoming. When she was able, Christine did reach out for comfort, for assistance in getting thru this devastating event in her life. She looked for inspiration, for people who understood what she was going thru, people who had survived this kind of loss. The response was amazing. She received so many responses of encouragement, of support and sympathy and lists and lists of resources to help her climb out of her depression. She tried and tried and tried. While living with this grief Christine faced serious jaw surgery. Christines teeth are literally falling out of her mouth and shes needed 6 teeth extracted, 4 root canals and too many fillings to count. The affect from twenty plus years of steroids and 7 months of throwing up 5-7 times a day during her pregnancy and saliva issues from Shogren's took their toll. Christine literally lost her smile  well, she still has a few teeth in the front. So, Christine's health has been on a roller coaster since January. As any Spoonie can appreciate, this has seriously flared Christines LUPUS and FIBROMYALGIA very badly, shes living in one of the worst Flares and Pain cycles she's ever had. She's also still trying to overcome the grief and depression from losing Charlotte. The grief and depression are as deep and dark and fresh as the day she lost her little Charlotte. Christine is in treatment for Postpartum / Post Natal depression  she's on a waiting list for a specific program  and there will be co pays.The events I've described have been physical, mental  and financial. There are a mountain of hospital bills already. She has worked with hospitals, lawyers, etc to discuss payment plans, consolidations etc. New York has many programs in place to help those that need it - but you have to be very progressive and aggressive and even 'mobile' to take advantage of them. She has really tried and made some progress - it will never be enough to cover all the bills. She's exhausted her resources - Currently, her parents are helping and the credit cards - well, they're at their max.Plus, there are more surgeries and repair work and more huge bills to come for Christine's literal smile. Dental surgery, implants and dentures don't come cheap. The financial aspect of all of this has given her a new symptom  Panic attacks and anxiety. It's been a constant battle to overcome the health issues, the grief and the mental health issues, the financial issues. It's taken a huge toll on our Super Strong Spoon Lady. Christine is finding it difficult to imagine the next day. She feels lost. What can you do to help Christine find her Mental and physical Smile again? What she needs most is help paying the bills. I know each and every Spoonie out there knows what that's like. But Christine's bills from January total near $50,000. Her bill from the dentist from a recent visit to begin the process of the implants  came to $3,000.00 No wonder she'd having anxiety attacks! If you could help her out by donating what you can to her here at Gofundme.com  it would be so appreciated. Our Spoon Lady Christine is so strong. She's also extremely private about her personal struggles, preferring to focus on those in the Spoonie community  To ask for this help from you  it's Huge. It took some convincing from a group of us to convince her that she needed to ask for help. .At the end of the day, Christine is a Spoonie too and after pouring her life into helping us all, she needs us to help her by giving a little back.Christine, her family and her closest friends, would be forever grateful for any financial help that you can give.She thanks you for the support over the years and for the support that you can give to her now. It means everything to her.Signed,Christine and Friends of Help Chris SmileP.S. May you have an abundance of Spoons!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Dylan Marshall Pancoast passed away far too young at the age of 19.Dylan experienced a massive aneurysm which ultimately resulted in his untimely death. It was as unpredictable as it was tragic. Through this tragedy the Pancoast family has found it's greatest solace in that Dylan's legacy will continuebeyond his life. Dylan had the very rare opportunity afforded to less than 2% of all people who pass in a hospital to donate his heart and other vital organs. Dylan's heart will beat for another life. As of the morning after his passing Dylan has already saved two lives and spared those families the suffering that the Pancoasts haveendured. The Pancoast family realized that this opportunity was far too valuable to squander. However, this came at the cost of prolonging the goodbye process and extending Dylan's time in the hospital.No parent should have to endure such a loss. Similarly, nobody should have to experience the death of their teenage baby brother. This loss is difficult enough without the unbelievable and staggering financial burden. Dylan had a prolonged stay in the hospital riddled with numerous tests, procedures, imaging and specialists from all over the country. The cost that the family may incur could exceed $50,000.The Pancoast's humbly ask that all of you that have offered to help in any manner to consider this your opportunity. Their focus should be that of mourning and championing Dylan's legacy and new found appreciation for organ donation. Not for associated finances. Any help that you may provide would warrant our immeasurable gratitude.Dictated by Brandon Pancoast on behalf of the Pancoast Family+ Read More"

One week into their vacation Maria got ill. She caught a cold, and this cold spread to her throat and eyes. On August 19th, Maria woke up with double vision and collapsed when trying to get out of bed. They immediately called 911 and took her to the hospital. After running all these tests, Maria was diagnosed with Guillain Barre with miller fisher Syndrome. Its a rare, but serious autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system. This leads to weakness, numbness, and tingling, and can eventually cause paralysis. My sister started treatment right away and was hospitalized for one week, and was receiving six IV therapy treatments for five days. In those 5 days, Maria could not walk, feed herself, could not bathe herself, and lost 50% of her vision. We could not believe what was happening to her. If she would have waited one more day, she would have been paralyzed. After treatment, she was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic for physical therapy to learn how to walk, feed herself, and pretty much use her entire body again. She is still receiving physical therapy daily in addition to medication to get her back to normal on a daily basis, so she can recover and come home. She still can't walk without assistance, has double vision, and is still very tired. It will be a long recovery, but Maria is remaining postive.During this time, they have encountered medical expenses, rehab expenses, and lost their tickets back home. In order for Maria to come back home to the states, she will need Medical assistance on the flight with her, because her traveling with her condition is very risky, and without medical assistance they will not let her travel back home. They need a nurse to be with her the whole flight to give Maria the medical attention she needs during this long flight. Once in Chicago, Maria will continue her physical therapy on a daily basis and continue getting the treatment she needs to fight this disease. We miss them all very much, and cant wait for her to come home. Being so far away from them this past month has been so hard on our entire family. And it has also been tough on them being in Italy having to go through all of this while being on vacation. Please donate any little amount helps. Your doanations will be to cover medical expenses, rehab costs, flights, and medical assistance on the flight.We appreciate all the love and prayers the past month we have received from family and friends. My heart is so full from all of the wonderful people that have been there for My sister and family through this difficult time.

This quickly developed into a ""Toxic Mega Colon"" that was about to rupture. After being hospitalized for 11 days, she agreed to the surgery that saved her life. Altogether, Linsey was ill for 27 days and hospitalized for 17. The surgery consisted of the complete removal of her Large Intestine, or Colon. This meant that Linsey had to have an ileostomy bag on her stomach to collect her waste, since she no longer had a colon.After a long road of recovery from the initial illness and surgery, Linsey is now able to get reconstructive intestinal surgery (J-Pouch Creation) that will eventallygive her the ability tohave somewhat normal bowel functions. This means the ileostomy bag will no longer be a cumbersome and frustrating experience for her, as it will be removed.Linsey's J-Pouch Creation surgery will be preformed at the University of Washington, on September 22nd, 2016. She will then have the third, and final surgery, at the end of December, to remove the ileostomy bag, when the surgery site has completely healed.The Wallace family has fair insurance coverage, but they are still responsible to pay 20% of the medical bills (hospital stay, surgery, perscriptions, etc...). With the sudden illness and medical bills from the last year, the family is still trying to recover financially.Any donations or financial contributions will be used to to cover medical bills and to pay for assistance for Linsey as she recovers.Any prayers, thoughts and kind words for the Wallace Family would be greatly appriciated during this time.Thank you for reading Linsey's story and for any prayer or financial support that you would like to give.God Bless,The Wallace FamilyMike, Linsey, Benjamin, Ariyanna and KayhlanLinsey Wallace is 35 years old and has been married to Mike Wallace for 14 years.

Neuroblastoma is a rare and aggressive form of pediatric cancer. Zoe and her family (Zach, Jennifer, and older sister, Chase) are just beginning an aggressive course of treatment that will likely span 18 months if everything goes well. The first several months of treatment include 6 cycles of chemotherapy and surgery to remove the main tumor, followed by a bone marrow rescue.The Haupt family could use support in the immediate future to improve the safety of the home for Zoe because her immune system is compromised due to chemotherapy treaments. She just completed the first round of chemotherapy and is going home from the hospital for two weeks to recover. Some of work that needs to be done is cleaning and/or replacing all carpets, having the house checked for any mold or fungus, waterproofing the basement, purifying the water sources, cleaning duct work and purifying air and replacing the washing machine. Another likely expense will be travel costs to speak with specialists at out of state hospitals to find the most skilled surgeons to attempt to remove her tumor. Funds would be appreciated as soon as possible so that the Haupts can make all of these enviromental updates and prepare for their battle against Neuroblastoma. This means so much tous because Zach (my brother)and Jenn are loving and wonderful parents and people. A few short weeks ago, Zoe looked like any other 4 year old, innocently playing with her friends.

Awstin already moves slower than his friends, falls frequently, becomes easily tired and is starting to use a wheelchair for longer distances. We have been told that Awstin will lose the ability to move without support between the ages of 8-11 years. The life expectancy for our son is his mid-twenties. Awstins specialists have advised us that there are many things to do to get ready as Awstins condition gets worse over time.We have started this fundraising page as the scale of what is happening to Awstin is far beyond our control and financial means.Mark and I have spent the past year grieving for the life that we thought our son was going to have. We now realise that due to the progressive nature of Duchenne, we need to practically prepare for Awstins needs and to do so we need to accept your help.  The first major task is to get our house ready so Awstin can move safely and freely around his home.We need a double-storey extension and adaptations are required to the current layout of the house for Awstins electric wheelchair. The changes are critical. It will mean Awstin can access all of our family home, and have his own bedroom and bathroom. Awstin will need support with breathing and having his room upstairs next to our bedroom means we are there for him when he needs us. We will get some support from our local council with this, but unfortunately it will fall far short of the whole cost. We think we will need at least an additional 20000 over what the council will fund. The whole process is becoming overwhelming and upsetting as we are worried that we might not be able to provide the essential things that Awstin is going to need to be comfortable and happy as he progresses through the stages of Duchennes. This is where we ask for your help. Those of you who know our Awstin will know that he is such a fun-loving little boy with a cheeky personality who loves his cuddles, or as we Welsh say, cwtches. As a family we can truly say that our family and close friends have been phenomenal over the past year for which we are eternally grateful!We are now in the process of putting our heads together to think of ways to fundraise for Awstins needs and already have a few things on the cards to look forward to! Here are some of the ways that you or someone you may know can help Awstin: Donate directly through  www.gofundme.com to Awstins Fund.

Unfortunately, near the end of the 112-mile bike course, Steve was involved in a serious bike wreck that put him in the ICU with skull fractures, brain swelling, a lung injury and multiple other fractures, some that will require surgery. Maggie and Steve are so thankful to the racers who stopped to assist him until an ambulance arrived - they may very well have saved his life.Steve is still in the hospital, on the road to recovery, but it will be a long process, and an expensive one, with Steve unable to return to work for many months to come.I am starting this campaign to help Maggie and Steve with medical and living expenses in light of the extended care he will require and associated loss of income.

His suspicion was cat scratch disease, and he ordered a series of labs to determine. Shiloh took the IV like a champ, and we played the waiting game for results. However, when a team of five doctors came in the room about an hour and a half later, it was pretty apparent that we werent just going home with a prescription. They said in the labs that his blood counts were off, and that they found blasts in his blood. ""What does that mean? I asked.

He has since been in the Neuro ICU. His surgery will be later today, 9/21, and is expected to be at the hospital for a week or 2 afterwards depending on his recovery.  Due to Eric being sick for a couple months, he has not been able to afford to pay for his health insurance. This will more than likely not be covered.

It came as quite the shock to her and her family. Things progressed quickly to discover she had stage 2, Nottingham grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma that is poorly differentiated. They began chemo soon after and she is currently receiving 6, she has been going approximately every 3 weeks for chemo. However, after her first round she became extremely ill and was in and out of the hospital numerous times. Come to find out her gallbladder was failing and she ended up going in for surgery. Round 2 and 3 had slight improvements but she was still in and out of the hospital repeatedly to help with the aftermath of the chemo; basically she would feel terrible for 2 weeks then have a week of feeling better to turn around and start all over again. In January, just a month or so after her diagnosis, she began losing her hair which meant time for cute hats to keep her chilly head warm! Penny has been unable to work since the diagnosis and her husband Mike is working as best he can, not to mention keeping up with their three busy kids! !Today was suppose to be my surgery but we got the genetic testing back and I am breca+ so that means my cancer is genetic. I was scheduled for a partial mastectomy and now I will have to have a bilateral total mastectomy and a few months later I will have to have a hysterectomy. I am still getting perjeta and herceptin every 3 weeks and that will be for a year. it has been very hard. I am so sick in the morning and can't eat much. I have lost almost 97lbs since my diagnosis in December. So my surgery is now scheduled for June 28th and praying nothing else changes before then. I plan on being a survivor...just hitting a few bumps in the road. Watching the special on Stand Up to Cancer and thinking of my journey and all those fighting this battle. A year ago my life was ""normal"". You never know what your future holds. Being diagnosed with breast cancer changed me, my husband, my kids...my entire family and friends. I am in a clinical trial and hope that one day it helps to find a cure so we can all be survivors! Even though I have had a bilateral mastectomy and the cancer tumor ""is gone"" it is an everyday thought for me. I wonder if it's anywhere else in my body, if it will come back. I have had to hold my treatment because of the damage that the chemo has done to my heart. The MUGA test I had showed the function was returning on the new cardiac med and holding treatment. I still have to have reconstruction surgery and a hysterectomy because of being BRCA+. So, my journey continues and I pray everyday for all who are going through this and hope one day to say, ""I survived breast cancer"". note from Mike i am her husband , But now the end is not so great now the finacial burden has put on our family. I am not sure you know but most of us are in the same situation we are one major illness from losing everything you have work for our entire lives . The finacial stress has be put on our family now is real and does not go away with her getting better or surgery .Our savings is depleted to nothing , loans have run out , family finacial support is very taxing on our whole family. But the bills keep coming . I am not a person who likes to ask for help those of you who know me , i like to be the helper and give its very unconfortable for me to recive. all our family and friends have been a unbeliveable life changing support system .Our lives will never be the same this is the worst thing to ever happen to me in my life   Thank you to my family and friends for all of the support you have given me. It gives me strength to take this one step at a time. I love you all!!.TEAM RUSSELL+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Basically, his brain is falling into his spinal canal. A simple surgery has turned into an absolute nightmare for Noah and our whole family.When Noah woke up from his surgery, he started to throw up and didnt stop for months. During that time, he lost 50lbs, and the doctors were not able to keep the nausea and vomiting under control. The doctors sent him to every specialist you can think of, trying to figure out why this was happening. However, they refused to do any MRIs or CAT scans, saying that the symptoms could not possibly be related to the surgery. We were told his symptoms were due to various causes ~ ranging from him needing bi-focals to acid reflux ~ but never the real reason.Finally, we decided to rush him to the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, where they were able to see that the symptoms were from his surgery. Within 48 hours of being seen at CHOP, Noahs nausea symptoms were alleviated by giving him steroids to reduce the swelling and pressure on his brain stem caused by his surgery. Noah lost 50lbs and endured 5 months of flu-like symptoms and severe headaches, when all he needed at that point was a round of steroids to reduce the swelling. Noah, however, had to stay at CHOP for an additional 2  weeks due to severe malnutrition.Noah returned home, and we all had a sense of excitement until his steroid regimen was over. Within a couple days, all of his symptoms were back. The doctors at CHOP ordered him another round of steroids, but this time it didnt work. With more MRIs and CAT scans, we found out that the scar tissue from the surgery, was now blocking the flow of cerebral spinal fluid, causing pressure on his brain stem. In addition, the large syrinx on his spinal cord from the Chiari had gotten larger. The surgeons at CHOP suggested that we should see a doctor named David Greenfield in New York City.The problem with this is that our insurance would not cover Noah seeing Dr. Greenfield. By the grace of God, upon hearing of Noahs condition and what happened, Dr. Greenfield waved his fees so that he could at least see Noah for an initial consultation. During this visit, we found out that Noah will need another surgery in the next few weeks in order to be able to lead a normal life, and be able to go back to school. He will need to build Noahs skull back up so he is able to reattach the muscles and put a stent through the scar tissue to restore normal flow of fluid to his brain and spinal cord. He is the only brain surgeon that specializes in this surgery.If anyone is able to help, we would very much appreciate it. Even sharing Noahs story with as many friends as possible will be an incredible help.Any and all donations will be used solely for medical expenses, transportation to, from, and in New York City, food and lodging, and basically any other costs involved with this surgery. We are so very thankful for any donations given to make our son's surgery possible. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Thank you so much for taking the time to read our post.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

While riding his bike to early morning cross country practice atCinco Ranch High School, he was hit by a car and had to be life flighted to Memorial Hermann Hospital. There he had several surgeries on his face, arm & mouth just to name a few. He's banged up, but we all know just how lucky he was. He'll require a few months recovery after which he'll need more surgery to replace the entire top row of teeth he lost in the accident.As you might imagine, helicopter rides (as Jahsh himself put it, ""Can you believe I got to ride in a helicopter?"") and multiple surgeries come with a steep price tag. The entire Cooks family isa great group of people and I'm proud to call them my friends. If you know them, you know what I'm talking about. If you don't, you should go out of your way to meet them.The family is blown away by the love and support they have received from both friends and complete strangers thus far. While at the hospital on Thursday, a family friend said, ""Tragedy is a lot like moving. When you move, you think, what did we do to get all this stuff? When hard times hit, you think, what did we do to get all this love and support. Usually they're both the same, they've always been there but you don't notice it until it becomes front and center.""I'd like to raise some money to help offsettheir growing burden and make sure that we're ""front and center"" when they could use it the most.

Buckley was one of the first people I met and one of my best friends my freshman year of college 20 years ago. We have remained close friends for all these years and it absolutely breaks my heart to see what he is going through physically and mentally. You see, Buckley was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) at the young age of 28 years old. He was living his dream of being a pilot and traveling the world. One of the many things this disease took from Buckley is his ability to do the one thing he has wanted to do his whole life...be a pilot. His body began to deteriorate and become damaged from this disease and he could no longer do many of the things he loved doing. For those of you who might not know, let me explain what MS is:MS is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. This can cause problems with vision, balance, muscle control and other basic body functions. All of which have happenedto Buckley.It is absolutely heartbreaking to not be able to help your friend while this disease breaks him down and destroys his life. At first, it was just some muscle spasms and not being able to stand for very long to now needing a wheelchair part-time, a cane and a walker.There is no hope for MS patients in the US except to look forward to a lifetime of drugs to try to stop the disease. I happened to come across an article about a stem cell replacement therapy surgery that was being used and successful at curing MS in other countries. I sent the information to Buckley and you could see the excitment in his email back to me. He dove into researching this procedure. He told me it is not offered here in the US except experimentally to a certain group of MS patients that he does not qualify for. It was a huge let down to know it was out there but untouchable. The other night, I was praying for Buckley and it popped into my head to raise money for his surgery!! I was energized again as I knew God would make it happen.This is what I am raising money for. What is Buckley's Beacon of Hope? It's this surgery. It is called HSCT, which stands for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and it is Buckley's only hope for a brighter future here on earth. The surgery Buckley has selected is combined with chemotherapy. The chemo kills the MS and then new stem cells are tranplanted to reboot the body's system. This procedure is curing MS in several different countries, however, only a handlful of countries offer it combined with the chemo. The surgery will cost approximately $55,000 plus flights, hotels, recovery, general expenses and loss of work which brings us to our goal of $75,000. The faster we reach are goal the sooner Buckley can get this procedure and get his life back and help others with MS.This means so much to me to be able to do this for my friend, to save his life, restore his bright future. I know with God's help and your help we can do this for Buckley. It is also important to raise awareness for this surgery!! There are thousands of people suffering just like Buckley who can be saved by this procedure.I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving to keep the light bright for Buckley's Beacon of Hope.Love and God bless,Desiree                    + Read More"

A 28 years old super cheerful girl, full of life and with a great spirit of adventure. Her love of nature and the beauty of other people and countries encouraged her to leave her native Australia and travel the world. She is currently in Tijuana Baja California, Mexico after more than a year since she left home.Sadly, last Tuesday, August 30, her health began to suddenly deteriorate. What began as a seemingly simple throat infection, turned more complicated. After seeing a doctor and several drugs that failed to heal her for nearly two weeks, some hematologic and radiologic studies showed the unexpected.Her bone marrow had inexplicably stopped producing vital white blood cells to attack bacteria and viruses, making her immune system virtually nonexistent. A scan showed that various bacteria were progressively invading her lungs, liver, small and large intestine, and kidneys, causing multiple infections involving her own normal flora of the body, which undefended become aggressive bacteria.Because of that on Tuesday, September 13, fighting for her life, Kat was admitted to the Sanatorio San Francisco de Tijuana and placed under a rigorous treatment based on high efficiency antibiotics (because her illness did not properly respond to common antibiotics), plus several transfusions and several medicines IV to provide her body the opportunity to resist such infections.Unfortunately, the needed daily tests, blood transfusions, stimulants of the immune system and gamma globulins (that have a very high price), hospital costs, an internist and a hematologist, a variety of drugs that are needed each day and the lack of health insurance in this country, have produced an expense of more than $ 2,000 USD per day.Among family and friends who love Kat, we are doing everything possible to offer the necessary support to achieve a full recovery and thank God it has been happening progressively.She will NEVER give up and what worries us the most is to get to a point of not having enough money for the next days treatment.Therefore, we wish for your help. We would be grateful if you could help us support Kat in her struggle for her life. Your donation will offer one more day at a time and thus give her enough time for recovery, which has begun to happen.We greatly appreciate your prayers for Kat and support that you can provide. We bless you from the bottom of our hearts.May God bless us all. *ESPAOL*Ella es Kat Stokes. Una chica de 28 aos sper alegre, llena de vida y con un gran espritu de aventura.

Lo que comenz como una aparente simple infeccin en la garganta, continuo complicndose. Despus de atenderse con un mdico y varios medicamentos que no lograron sanarla durante casi dos semanas, unos estudios hematolgicos y radiolgicos mostraron lo inesperado. Su medula sea inexplicablemente haba dejado de producir glbulos blancos indispensables para atacar bacterias y virus, haciendo su sistema inmunolgico prcticamente inexistente. Una tomografa mostr que diversas bacterias de manera progresiva estaban invadiendo sus pulmones, el hgado, el intestino delgado y grueso, y los riones, causando mltiples infecciones involucrando a la propia flora normal de su cuerpo, que sin defensas se convierten en bacterias agresivas.Debido a esto el Martes, 13 de Septiembre y luchando por su vida, Kat fue internada en el Sanatorio San Francisco de Tijuana y puesta bajo un tratamiento riguroso de antibiticos de alta eficacia (ya que su cuadro no respondi adecuadamente a los antibiticos comunes), adems de varias transfusiones y medicamentos diversos IV para ofrecerle la oportunidad a su cuerpo de resistir dichas infecciones. Lamentablemente, los estudios diarios necesarios, trasfusiones de sangre, productos estimulantes del sistema inmunolgico y gammaglobulinas (de muy alto precio), costos de hospital, honorarios de un Mdico Internista y un Hematlogo, una gran variedad de medicamentos que son necesarios le sean suministrados cada da y por la falta de un seguro mdico en este pas, han causado un gasto de ms de $2,000 USD diarios. Entre familiares y amigos que amamos a Kat, estamos haciendo todo lo posible para poder ofrecerle el respaldo necesario para que se recupere por completo y gracias a Dios lo ha estado haciendo poco a poco.Ella NUNCA se dar por vencida y nos preocupa que lleguemos al momento de no tener suficiente dinero para su tratamiento de cada da.Por eso por este medio suplicamos tu ayuda.

Even though they have insurance, it will not cover the entire amount of the hospital stay. Zuzi and George are already absorbing the extra cost of a new van that helps George get out of the house, and now once he gets back home, they will need to buy a Hoyer Lift to help him get in and out of bed.

Every time something was taken away, I would think, 'it can't get any worse; he still has his whole life ahead of him.' When he was no longer able to work, to drive, to walk, I would pray everyday for it to stop...but it's not stopping. It continues to hit harder and harder and I hopelessly watch him deteriorate. Yet he NEVER complains, takes every day as it comes, with all the struggles it brings, bravely, with humor and a smiling face. He still manages to joke with everyone. Even when the ambulance came to take him to the hospital, he was talking with the firefighters, joking with them and asking what football teams they were rooting for. George is the most amazing person with the biggest, most self-less heart. He makes everyone feel great about themselves. He could have the most miserable day, but think only of me and Nikolka. He never thinks of himself first, never feels sorry for himself. He is the love of my life and I want to make his life more bearable, more comfortable, more dignified.""I know all of us have our own personal issues to deal with but I'm asking for you to donate whatever you can to help. His disease is progressing and they need to make arrangements to be able to do normal everyday things that we all take for granted. Please help as much as you can. You'll never miss it in the long run and it will mean more than you could ever know to them! Also, I can't forget to mention this...everyperson who donates will be invited to George's 'Lift Me Up' dance-party, complete with all your favorite Euro-dance hits, homemade food and drinks galore!!

Sgt Peck's Arm Transplant Fund,"$13,564 ","$125,000 ",Medical," January 15, 2016",266,8,FREDERICKSBURG,VA,4900,2,5,"                            John M Peck                                                                                                                   FREDERICKSBURG, VA                                In 2007, Sgt. John Peck, formerly of Antioch, IL, was serving in Al Anbar province, Iraq when he was first wounded. After a daylong patrol searching for Taliban, receiving small arms fire, finding a cache of HME (Home Made Explosives), waiting for his unit's EOD team, it was time to go back to base. He was manning the machine gun for the lead vehicle, as it rounded a corner the vehicle was hit by a pressure initiated IED. He was thrown from his seat and smashed his head into the machine gun. He remembers fragments from that night. As a result, John was left with vision, balance, and hearing problems. He also suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and suffered short- and long-term memory loss, forgetting everything up to the point of the injury. Twenty-one years of memories were gone. He had to learn everything all over again. To this day he continues to have problems remembering things from before incident, difficulty finding words, and short term memory issues.His first injury didnt stop him from going back to serve his country. He had to beg and plead with doctors to release him from limited duty. You're probably wondering at this point why? Why would he go back and not just take the medical discharge? ""As a Marine we don't do it for the pay or the benefits, we go back for the guys on our left and on our right.""However, on May 24, 2010, life once again changed dramatically for John. At the age of 24, Sgt. Peck was serving in Helmand province, Afghanistan when he stepped on an IED and triggered an explosion that would change his life forever. The resulting blast amputated his legs, part of his right arm, damaged his left arm, and caused third-degree burns on his stomach. Sgt. Peck is one of only two people alive to survive blood contamination by the flesh eating fungus, Aspergillosis. As a result of complications from surgery, doctors were forced to amputate part of his left arm, making him the third quadruple amputee of the Afghan and Iraq wars.RECOVERYThrough the blast and twenty-seven different surgeries, John received forty-one pints of blood, thirty-five units of plasma and five units of platelets, and at one point bled out completely. He was medically sedated from late May to early August, during which he endured daily surgeries to clean out debris and dead flesh and to fight the infection that was slowly spreading through his body. At one point his family received the heartbreaking news that John was living minute to minute and the doctors, sadly, suggested they say their last goodbyes. During his surgeries, he flat lined three times and was pronounced dead once. By the time his body finally started to fight back against the multiple infections attacking it, he was left with his right arm amputated above the elbow, left arm amputated at the mid forearm, and right leg amputated just above the knee. He is also missing his left bicep, first layer of abdominal muscles and his entire left leg due to the flesh-eating fungus. The complete loss of his leg means he's forced to sit on his pelvic bone - a painful task with which he has learned to cope. When he awoke in early August he was informed by his family of his extensive injuries, sedation, and near death experiences. Because of his tracheal tube, he couldn't speak without using a special device. In order to have the tube removed, he had to perform swallow tests which is where the doctor's thread a small camera down your throat and feed you small amounts of food and liquid to see if your throat can handle it. ""I remember all I wanted was a Mountain Dew and they couldn't let me have it. One day a nurse walked in with a small can, popped it open and poured it into a bag. She left a second can behind and I, thinking it was soda, told her, 'As soon as you leave that's mine!' I soon came to find it was medication."" When he woke up he couldn't move any part of his body. He had no strength to lift his limbs nor any range of motion so he had to be stretched out daily. However, there was a problem, John's skin had become hyper sensitive to touch. In short, the minute anyone made contact with him he was in enormous amounts of pain.After years of recovery, John is now equipped with prosthetics, a all terrain wheelchair outfitted with tank-like treads, and other equipment to supports his needs.Every year John's determination inspires those around him - from jumping out of a plane to scuba diving in Key West, and even completing fifty miles on a hand cycle. John also has a passion for helping those who have fallen on hard times: ""I was raised by a single mother and every Christmas it was a financial struggle for her. You could see the pain in her eyes as the need to put food on the table outweighed the Christmas wishes of her young son. After my injuries I vowed I would help as many families as I possibly could at Christmas time."" In 2011 he started at a Target in Washington, D.C. - helping a single mother purchase gifts for her daughter and surprising the woman with a gift as well. In 2012, after moving to his new home, he helped another mother with two children in Wal-Mart. In 2013 he changed his method and instead of approaching families, he decided to go to layaway and pay off three random accounts with toys on them. THE FUTURE John was recently approved for a double arm transplant. Through multiple tests including; skin type, blood draws, mental exams, vein mapping, and ultrasounds, the doctors determined he was a strong candidate. He is currently waiting for the call that will take him to Boston and give him back his arms.For the first year following the procedure, John and a caretaker will have to travel up to Boston every three months to ensure everything is healing properly, which means hotel rooms, gas, and meals. After that first year, he will have to return to Boston every six months for the next five years, and will need to take immune suppressants for the rest of his life so his body doesn't reject the transplant. Although the double arm transplant is a miracle of the 21st century, it will also be an expensive and long-term recovery for him and his family.John's dream is to be a chef - since he was 12 he has had a passion for cooking. After losing his arms, many people thought he would give up but that's not the case. He may not be able to be as hands-on in the kitchen as before but that doesn't stop him from instructing, tasting and completing simpler tasks. His own personal hero? ""Robert Irvine. He's an awesome chef, he helps people who are in need and he's like a British version of The Hulk!""For more videos and pictures go to  www.johnpeckfund.orgAny questions about becoming a donor or need more info email me Jmpeck1985@gmail.com                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

The resulting tests, medical visits and medications have taken a toll on Ian physically, emotionally and financially.Ian will have surgery on October 24, 2016 to decrease the size of the tumor. As it is impossible for doctors to take out the entire mass, he will then possibly face chemotherapy and radiation to further treat the tumor. Ian will be awake for the surgery, as this is the first time his doctors are doing this procedure on an artist. They will ask him to draw while having the surgery done to hopefully maintain use of his arm, hand and artistic skills. Doctors anticipate that the surgery should not effect Ian's speech but will most likely leave permanent damage to his right side. During this time it has been difficult for Ian to make work or have a job. We would like to raise funds for Ian's day to day expenses, medical fees and ongoing care. The funds are needed immediately for living expenses and will all go directly to Ian. Ian has generously donated works to multiple benefit auctions in the past and we would love to show him the same generosity in return. His gallery is also waiving their fee for any works that are purchased, all proceeds from the sales of his work will go in full to the artist.

Help Cathy get Treatment ,"$6,935 ","$10,000 ",Medical," September 16, 2016",100,9,NORTHFIELD,NJ,686000,2,3,"                            Brian Bowles                                                                                        on behalf of Cathy  PetrickNORTHFIELD, NJ                                Local Family Needs You In Their Corner During Fight Against CancerWhen Tom Petricks wife Cathy was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2013, he and his family knew they had a long, difficult road ahead of them. With the support of their friends, co-workers, and extended families, the Petricks were able to weather the initial storm of medical bills, grim diagnoses, and the mounting responsibilities that accompany the treatment and management of a serious illness. Still, each day presents its challenges: tasks as simple of household chores and rides to school become choreographed productions; trips to the doctor produce stress and anxiety, require co-pays and deductibles, and necessitate coordination with babysitters. The family has persevered, adopting the fearless attitude Cathy has shown through her battle. Her motto- Well manage; we always do. For 3 years, they had done just that. However, everything changed in May 2016 and now both parents find themselves fighting the fiercest of enemies. Residents of Northfield, NJ for over 20 years, the Petrick family has sent their four sons, Brian (35), Thomas (22), DJ (21) and Matthew (14) through the Northfield Community School system and Mainland Regional High School. This year their adopted daughter Danielle (5) begins kindergarten at NCS. While their involvement in the community has been stymied by their illnesses, the Petrick family remains loyal to their Atlantic County roots and eternally grateful to the friends, family and neighbors whove supported and befriended them over the years. But with heavy, humble hearts, they ask for your help.A chef at Margaritaville Restaurant in Atlantic City, NJ, Tom works tirelessly to support his family and to ensure his health insurance can help offset the costs of Cathys care. In May of 2016, Tom took some family leave time off to care for Cathy but found himself suffering from a sore throat and painful swelling. When it did not subside, he visited the doctor and had some tests run. The diagnosis was Hashimotos Thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease where damaged thyroid cells are attacked by the immune system. Symptoms of this illness include problems with metabolism, insomnia, depression/anxiety, and as in Toms case, lymphoma of the thyroid and GI region. During surgery to remove his thyroid, surgeons discovered and removed several cancerous lymphs- he has since been diagnosed with MALT lymphoma. While his prognosis is still unclear, the immediate emotional and financial stresses this puts the Petrick family under are obvious. Between missed work, double the co-pays, deductibles, lifetime and yearly insurance limits, and the responsibilities of having one kid in kindergarten and two in college, the pressure can be overwhelming. Still, Cathys motto echoes loudly- Well manage; we always do. In 2013, Catherine Petrick (Bowles) experienced severe but seemingly unrelated symptoms: painful bumps under the surface of her skin, digestion issues, chest pains, exhaustion and dizziness. Doctors were baffled as they treated each symptom individually, trying to rule out common illnesses. The bumps grew, her appetite shrank and her overall health declined. Cathy, ever selfless, continued working hard to support her family- for over 15 years she worked as a server at East Bay Crab & Grille in Egg Harbor Township. Beloved by her regular customers and co-workers, Cathy wore a brave smile and bolstered a positive attitude despite her health concerns. These friends and co-workers remain an integral part of Cathys support system today. For months, Cathy worked through the pain. Finally, in March 2013 doctors found their culprit- a rare form of cancer called Neuroendocrine Carcinoma. Affecting less than 2,000 people each year, this disease causes tumors to grow on and around glands in the endocrine system (thyroid, pineal & pituitary glands, pancreas, adrenal gland, etc). Her painful bumps were found to be tumors growing on lymph sites around her body. The decrease in appetite caused by Medullary thyroid cancer, a related disease. The exhaustion a result of a tumor on her adrenal gland. Still, Cathy has managed. While malignant growths spread throughout her body, including to her lungs and brain, Cathy remains as active and positive as possible. Breathing is difficult. Headaches are constant. Painful tumors protrude from various sites around her body making it difficult to get comfortable, but the hardest part is surely not being able to hug and squeeze her husband, sons and daughter. Her strength in spite of these factors is nothing short of inspirational! She has endured 15 sessions of radiation therapy directed at shrinking the tumors deep in her brain. She has spent countless hours in hospitals and offices completing 10 courses of IV chemotherapy, cutting-edge immunotherapy, and innumerable x-rays, scans and blood tests. She has completed dozens of rounds of oral chemotherapy in an attempt to slow the growth of and shrink the most aggressive tumors. Though she has lost a considerable amount of weight, is in almost constant pain and is still waiting for her beautiful hair to grow back, she has not lost her sense of humor, her hope for a cure, or her motherly essence. As she sees her daughter Dani off to school in the morning one can see the same gleam in her eye that was there 30 years ago when she sent her first child to kindergarten. Neuroendocrine carcinoma is treatable but a cure has not yet been found. Every day, oncologists and immunologists work to develop new treatments and the Petricks regularly visit the doctors at Penn University in hopes of testing one of these miracle cures. In the meantime, Cathys quality of life depends on her bodys ability to withstand the onslaught of chemotherapy and her minds ability to produce courage despite being outmatched by an undefeated opponent. Despite having insurance, the family incurs thousands of dollars in medical bills every month. The Petrick family needs you in their corner in order to win this fight. Your support will alleviate some of the financial pressures of a family where both parents are undergoing treatment for cancer. The family is currently trying to meet an $8,000 insurance deductible so Cathy and Tom both can continue their treatments. Your support will inspire hope in their 5 children that their mother and father will be around for another Thanksgiving, Christmas, and round of birthdays. Your support will provide a window of time during which a miracle cure might be developed. Your support, however big or small, will help. Instead of- Well manage- lets help this family say- We will PREVAIL!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We have 6 children from ages 22 to 7 years old. We are a humble and normal family that has been rocked by Brain Cancer. Recieiving a diagnosis of that magnitude is hard to understand and on top of that pain you realize that financially you are devastated as well. October 27,2015 was a life-changing day! The day the MRI of the brain results were given to us with the news of a tumor in the right frontal lobe of the Brain. It's a day we will never forget for it changed everything about our world and how the future would be. 2 weeks later it was confirmed to be a brain cancer. My husband is 43 and has a Glioma brain tumor. What turned from months of severe headaches and weakness and balance problems was now an answer we were not prepared to hear. The neurosurgeon confirmed the diagnosis and set Ryan up with Neuro oncology. That apppointment was very upsetting and were told that chemotherapy and radiation was a must after surgery and that he had a long journey ahead of him with recovery. Ryan is set to have the tumor removed in next couple of weeks. Luckily we have insurance which allowed us to seek a cancer center at Ohio State. The downfall to that is that we live 2.5 hours away from there. My husband has always been a hardworking man but since seeing oncology and a 3 day hospital stay at OSU for many test, he is not allowed to return to work at the plant that he has worked for many years, and provided for his family. We aren't even sure that he will even return. I have 14 days of paid vacation I can take but after that I will not have any income coming in at all on days I miss to care for my husband . So our fears and worrying is enhanced with fears of losing everything we have As a stout Christian family we have always been on the helping side and find it very difficult to ask for help or realize the financialburden we are currently under and facing soon We have went to a one income, which is mine but it's barely enough to cover basic needs. We are looking at many many months of recovery , I will be at his side. My heart is heavy and we just want healing . Only one of our kids is at home now, and that is Tyler, 7 years old. He was diagnosed with special needs just last September so our family was already hurting greatly. The other children are grown and on their own. My husband is a kind soul, loves the Lord with all his heart , loves his family and friends and church and WVU. He strives to be the best husband, father, son, and brother and Christian that he can be. Thank you for reading this and if you feel that it's on your heart to help us in this time of need then God Bless You. If you can't help I just appreciate your prayers.

In May, a simple and minor accident at school meant the loss of her left hand ring finger, amputated at the top knuckle, because her little body has been so depleted from the year and months of chemo and steroids that her poor finger couldn't withstand a minor trauma.Her hair has grown back, but it is still all over her pillow when she wakes up.She has entered the maintenance phase of treatment, which should be the easiest, and it is, but all these months have taken their toll on her. We're back in the hospital now, no real idea for how long, because her liver and her pancreatic functions are poor, her bone marrow isn't cooperating, her blood won't clot, her immune system is shot. We're hoping for the best, afraid for the worst. But she is done. No more bravado, no more stiff upper lip. She's a scared little girl and she isn't so sure anymore. When she's awake, she's afraid and anxious. She needs me by her side. She needs her mom.I should have worked 9 hours yesterday but I didn't and without a second thought. I should have worked today too. I should work tomorrow. But I'm not going to leave her side. Your generosity over the last year and half has meant that I was able to take care of my child when she needed me. It held us through the hardest 18 months a parent can imagine. Since we let this campaign trail off, I've been doing my very best as a single mom to keep it together and I've been doing it, but a missed day of work is hard to recover from. Missing a week means choosing the power bill over groceries. More than that is hard to recover from. We don't get food stamps or assistance because we live on the edge of the poverty line. Too much to get help, not enough to survive. I am grateful beyond telling that you continue to buouy us along. The communities that have come together out of love for our little Sparrow are divers and humbling. Friends and family and strangers. Audiophiles and punk rockers, lovers of music and art, drama club kids, caberet, tattooers, artists, musicians, business people. I love that so much of our support comes from the fringes. We're the weirdos, and we come together like nobody's business.Until the day I die, I will be grateful beyond telling. This girl is the very best of me. She's everything. I need her like the air in my lungs. I need to be beside her. For as long as I have her, I have to be there.Meet Jolie...Sweet Jolie was born and she hit the ground running. From the beginning, she was an unstoppable force of nature. Always a quirky child, sweet and thoughtful, loving and compassionate, she grew into her own person, and I'm telling you the world has never seen the like. She had a natural gift for math and science, and developed an uncanny interest in time travel. She wanted to learn magic and card tricks and seemed to have a bright future ahead of her as a grifter. And then one day she discovered rock and roll. More accurately, she discovered Kiss and other bands she could listen to when she wasn't listening to Kiss. She amassed a record collection that would make a hipster cry. Dude, she owns Music from the Elder. She waited three long years to be old enough to go to Girls Rock summer camp. She enrolled and was accepted. She was going to be a drummer. She was going to write all her own songs.But she started getting tired, really tired. Those long arms and legs that were going to serve her so well as a drummer started to ache all the time. Her belly hurt. One night it hurt so bad, her mom and dad took her to the emergency room thinking it was her appendix.The doctors drew blood to look for infection, but they found something else even more alarming. The hematologist-oncologist was called in to give his opinion. Leukemia.Her hemoglobin was so low, they were surprised she could sit up and talk. Somehow her body had adapted to running on about a quarter of the blood it needed to survive. She was admitted to the ICU to be given transfusion after transfusion. Once she was strong enough, a bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. This beautiful little rock and roll star has cancer.Her road ahead is long and winding and not very well lit. Her mom and dad have no idea what is in store for them. Cancer takes a devastating toll on a family, and financially, while not the smallest part of this, is at least the easiest to address.We're asking for donations for Jolie and her family to help them in the months and years to come as they support Jolie in her war. Her parents need to be there for her, not worrying about missing work and paying bills. This is one small thing we can do for this very small warrior. We owe it to the future of rock and roll. https://www.facebook.com/joliesarmy+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

He was born with a condition called Chiari Malformation. Pretty much all that means is his brain is drooping down in the back of his skull. Now for the last 18 and a half years we never knew he had this condition. He has always been a very active, happy person. He has played sports from soccer to baseball to lacrosse to hockey. He loves to be active and hang out with friends and family. Your typical 18 year old boy.A few months ago Christian was playing volleyball with his friends and hurt his neck. Little did we know that was just the beginning of a journey. At first, it was just his neck; then the pain spread and he started to feel numb throughout the left side of his body. He went to two different doctors that told him he just needed rest and to use heating pads to relax the muscles. Weeks went by and nothing got better, it actually got much worse. One day Christian was trying to help our older brother, Anthony, with some light yard work. He came inside and he obviously was in a lot of pain. I asked him what was wrong and he expressed to me how much pain he was in. That day, I looked up doctor after doctor to try and find out what was wrong with my brother. Eventually I came across a neurologist that was in our area and took our insurance. I gave Chris the information and he called that day and was able to get an appointment the next week. He needed to have some tests run. By having an MRI they found out that his brain is drooping back so far that it is causing a blockage of spinal fluid in the top of his spinal cord.To repair this issue Christian needs to undergo very invasive brain surgery that will be taking place this Friday, September 23rd, at Stonybrook Hospital. They will be opening up his skull to get to his spinal cord to try and widen the spinal cord to clear the blockage of fluid that has developed. He will need to stay in the hospital for 4 days and can't go back to school in Cortland for at least 3 weeks.All of the money raised will go towards helping Christian with his medical bills. On average, a 4 day hospital stay at Stonybrook is close to $50,000, that is not including the extra fees they throw in that are not covered by insurance. Any little bit of money can help!Christian is a smart, sweet, funny, caring, athletic and outgoing 18 year old. Nobody deserves to be in this much pain and this much debt at such a young age.Thank you everyone in advanced!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

He recently graduated from Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Illinois, this past Spring with a vocal performance degree. He has always been full of determination, working while going to school full time and performing with his beautiful voice all over Illinois. He never ceases to amaze me with his numerousaccomplishments. He was making plans to continue his education once he decided on a graduate school. Those plans came to a screeching hault a few nights ago. While Tyler was visiting a friend's new apartment in Alton, Illinois, he and two others stepped out on to a fire escape platform, which collapsed underneath the three of them. They fell approximately 25 feet to an asphalt alley. Tylerlanded on his head, suffering severe head trauma and multiple skull and facial fractures. Immediately after, he was airlifted to Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. He is currently in a medically induced coma in the ICU, with an unclear future ahead. Tyler has always been a leader in our family, even through the death of our Dad in 2012, he was a rock for my Mom and me. He was, and hopefully will continue to be a leader and a shining star in countless peoples' lives. Although everyone's thoughts and prayers have been a tremendous blessing to me and my family, Tyler still needs your financial support in his fight to pull through this extremely difficult time. My brother has changed so many lives in his 22 years with us, and we all plan for him to continue that for many years to come.Please help me bring our shining star back into the spotlight where he belongs, so he can keep performing and making us proud. I don't know what I would do without my big brother guiding me in everything I do.Our entire family thanks everyone who has reached out to us in the past few days. We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers we have recevied, and the many more to come. Thank you so much for your support.To read the full story on the events that unfolded after the accident and to get updates on Tyler's progress, please visit our website  www"

Seven years ago, he began having issues with Tinnitus, balance problems and short term memory loss which was a neurological issue that took five years to diagnose correctly. It included many different visits to neurologists in Anderson, The Cleveland Clinic, and Indiana University. These problems required hospitalization and multiple visits to the emergency room. Eventually, it all lead to brain surgery, placing a shunt near his brain to control the flow of spinal fluid which surrounds and protects the brain. Several procedures were required following his brain surgery to recalibrate the mechanics of the shunt, controlling the flow of spinal fluid. Doctors finally diagnosed Dennis with Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The extended time needed to diagnose his disease left him with frontal lobe brain damage, which causes him to suffer from brain events that mirror seizures, balance issues, and short-term memory loss. Inevitably forcing him to retire in 2010.2015 brought hospital stays with sepsis and a forced knee replacement. Dennis and his wife Doris are still making payments to Community Hospital to this day.Two months ago he was diagnosed with rectal cancer. He now faces six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, Monday through Friday. His co-pay for these six weeks of chemotherapy pills was $885. Hell rest for two months following this first round of treatment. If all goes well, he will have surgery to remove the cancer and lymph nodes in the surrounding area, which will require him to spend 5 to 10 days in the hospital in Indianapolis. After surgery, he will have a colostomy for up to 7 months alongside five more months of chemotherapy. Following the last round of chemotherapy, a second surgery to repair the colon will be needed when his rectal area heals.He and his wife are looking at deductibles, co-pays for a PET scan, rectal ultrasound, chemotherapy medication, and other miscellaneous medical bills associated with this cancer which will be substantial. All of these expenses on a county government retirement, and Medicare, after spending their savings on the prior years medical bills. They have been paying out-of-pocket over the last seven years.Dennis and his wife Doris have both served at the Madison County Sheriff's Department for 28 years, and both retired as high ranking officers. Both of them have always gone above and beyond to help their community and anyone that has crossed their path in need. Due to the extended amount of time taken to diagnose Dennis correctly, they have ended up spending their entire retirement savings on his medical condition.Dennis & Doris Maxey need financial help, and it nearly killed them to ask for it. I am here now, asking for any help you can provide. They have both given so much to the community and others in need over the years. Join me in supporting them, as they have helped others.If Doris or Dennis have touched your life in their 28 years of public service, now is the time they could use your help. Any additional funds raised not being utilized for the associated expenses will be donated to someone else in need of financial support during their medical crisis.I give you my word that this GO Fund Me request and its potential response will be used wisely.Dennis and his family can not express their gratitude enough towards anyone that makes a donation.Madison County Sheriff  Anderson, INScott Mellinger                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

This is where the beautiful, yet heartbreaking journey of Jason and Tiffany Alberts' life as a familybegins.I'm sure they would tell you that their lives truly didn't begin until their oldest son, Luke, was born. Luke's sister, Myah, soon followed; before Jason and Tiff knew it, they were blessed with not one, two, or three sweet kiddos--but five wonderful and perfect blessings from God. Life was good, and they all loved it well.The first big challengethey facedcamein the form of a bright-eyed boy named Joey...their next to youngest baby. Once a happy, talkative, and inquisitive toddler, Joe-Joe quickly started retreating into himself. Words he said easily suddenly stopped, and emotional outbursts became frequent as the outgoing toddler they once knew became distant and aloof in a matter of months. It wasn't long before Joey stopped speaking altogether. After a few tests and observations,Jason and Tiff received the news: Joe-Joe had autism. With their strong faith in God and Tiffany's degree as a special education teacher, they faced the new reality of Joey's worldand what it would mean, and set out to find every resource and therapy that would benefit and encourage him to explore and learn through his new eyes.As the Alberts kiddos grew,two other diagnoses would be discovered: their oldest, Luke, also had a mild form of autism and their middle son, Jake, had a hearing impairment and needed hearing aides. Little speedbumps in life, but nothing Jason and Tiff couldn't handle throughtheir unwavering faith and love for each other.Life took asharp turnfor the Alberts in September of 2013, however. Joey started throwing bigger fits and seemed to be in pain, yet with his verbal deficitswas unable to communicate to anybody what was truly wrong. Trips to the neurologist at Riley Children's hospital revealed that Joe-Joe had Chiari Malformation: a herniation of the cerebellum that goes into the brain stem. Sweet little Joe-Joe had an 11 mm herniation; and on October 25th, 2013, Joey had surgery to fix it in hopes that his symptoms would soon be relieved.All went back to normal after surgery...at least what was normalfor the Alberts family. Ballgames and wrestling matches, birthday parties and sleepovers, the Alberts went back to enjoying what made them so special: loving each other.Then Myah developed a cyston her head. Seemingly benign and with the reassurancethat it was probably nothing, Myah went into surgery for cyst removal at Riley on February 8th, 2016.Pathology reports soon came back, and what was thought was a cyst was not really at all: it wasFollicular AdnexalCarcinoma, a form of cancer in the sweat gland. MRIs and oncology appointments were scheduled and on March 31st, Myah went in for surgery to remove the rest of the cancer. Like always, Myah was her usual spunky, fighting self throughout it all.It wasn't long beforeshewas running and jumping in track like a pro...only two weeks after surgery!On April 7th the results were in...Myah was in the clear! The cancer hadn't spread and surgery was a success. Myah didn't have to see the oncologistor have an MRI for another 8-12 months! To say Jason and Tiff were celebrating the miracle God had given them was an understatement. Their baby girl was healthy, happy, and back to being her beautiful, sportsy self.Joy was short-lived, however.Jason started losing his vision quickly and was sleeping often. Chalking it up to stress and anxiety from Myah's diagnosis, at first Tiffany wasn't too worried. Thatquickly changed. Only six days after hearing that Myah was cancer-free,Jason received the devastating news: a large brain tumor was invading-- wrapping around his carotid artery, hypothalamus gland, and pushing on his brain stem. A very risky surgery was scheduledto remove it on May 12th. With unshakabefaith, the Alberts family faced their biggest challenge of all: saving their hero...their daddy.Jason didn't make it to surgery. A massive blood clot filled his lungs; and with his true love by his side, Jason flewto his Heavenly Home to meet his Savior face-to-face on May 14th.He leaves behind a devoted wife and 5 children, ages 5 to 15. To say they are heartbroken is such an understatement, and they are left planning a funeral instead of their next softball or baseball game with their daddy/coach. Medical bills have piled up with all of the recent tragedies they have faced; and with a special needs child that requires around-the-clock care, Tiffany is left alone without her helpmate to deal with it all. Please consider donatingto this family...you'll never find a better cause to give to. Most of all, please keep them in your every prayer as they face a giant no spouse or child should ever have to deal with tonight.We love our Alberts family.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I was raised by a village so to speak. A small community where everyone looked out for each other. The sick, hungry, homeless, the elderly, anyone in need.That's where my moral compass is anchored. I migrated to the United States with my family at the age of 15. I finished high school in Brooklyn and attended college in Vermont.

Tiana has been living with this tumor for 2 years. Tiana's mom, Lacie, stopped taking her to the hospital after they said they couldn't do anything else for her and she also felt as if they were treating her like an experiment. Lacy struggles daily to provide Tianna with the necessities. She's in dire need of financial assistance for food, meds, travel documents and the medical assistance she needs.  Being that I've been with Jermaine since he got to the States and has had surgery, I can tell you, Tianna has a very hard road ahead of her. Even though the tumors are in different places, it's obvious that her palette is destroyed and so is her nasal cavity. Her palette will be removed if and when the tumor is removed.

She is also a big sister to our 21 month old daughter, Abigail Mae Andrews.  Last week on Thursday, March 10, 2016,Belle was diagnosed with an extremely rare genetic disease called Niemann-Pick TypeC-1 Disease (NPC1). Only500 children have NPC1 in the worldand there only 100 diagnosed cases in the United States. The average life-span of children who go untreated is between 12 and 20 years of age. Most children with NPC1 will die in their mid-teens.As you can imagine, when we were told that she had inherited this horrific genetic disease we were heart broken and quite frankly, our worst nightmare was realized. We want to save our daughter and we need your help to do so. This disease has been described aschildhood Alzheimers. NPC1 is a genetic disease where harmful amounts of cholesterol accumulate in cells membranes throughout the body,affecting the brain, spleen, liver, among many other things. This accumulation of cholesterolimpairs normal brain function and results in neurological degeneration.If left untreated, Belle could suffer from seizures, dementia, ataxia, and cataplexy. Eventually, sufferers of NPC end up in wheelchairs, unable to speak, and unable to recognize their loved ones. Belle began showing symptoms about three years ago and for the last three years we have consulted withspecialist after specialist after specialist.It was finally recommended that we do the Whole Exome Genetic test by our friend and one of Belle's physical therapists Mary Elizabeth Parker, which we did before Thanksgiving last year.We just got the results back last week.  We have begun the process of putting a treatment plan together and we have a huge mountain to climb to even begin management ofthis disease for Belle. Physically, emotionally, financially and spiritually this mountainseems unsurmountable at times. However we are committed to doing whatever weneed to do to save our precious 6 year old daughter.  The best doctors in the United States treating NPH1, and thus for Belle, are in Chicago and Washington, DC at the National Institute for Health (NIH). They both are specialists in NPHC1 and we will need to visit with them every other week for the next 52 weeks to geta non-FDA-approved drug that is Belle's only hope at slowing the progression of this disease.Because the drug can only be obtained for ""compassionate use"", the process could take up to five months.The medical costs, coupled with the cost of travel and the amount of work that we will inevitably have to miss will take an exorbitant financial toll on our family. Additionally, Belle will need to be on this medication for the rest of her life.It is our sincere hope that within the years to come this drug will be approved by the FDA and insurance will begin to cover it.  Because this is a genetic disease, we are now testing our 21 month old daughter, Abigail Mae,as well. There is a 25% chance that she, too, has NPC1, and a 50% chance that she is a carrier of the disease Chris and I are humbly asking all of our friends, and friends of friends for help. We need any kind of support you can offer. Spiritually, emotionally, financially, etc. We will not be able to do this alone and we are desperate to help save our daughter from this dreadful and hideous disease. Thank you in advance for your kindness, your loveand your compassion. Pam and Chris Andrews                                            + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We are asking for support of our dearly loved family members to help keep them and their growing family strongSherels Strong. **For a complete and detailed story of what Mike and Emily have just gone through, please reference the inspiring article published in the Star Tribune by Chip Scoggins. Mike Sherels, Husband, father, son, brother, and University of Minnesota Linebackers Coach recently went through a severe health crisis. From July 24 to August 19, life as we knew it changed. After spending eight days in the hospital and going through multiple procedures, due to unknown internal bleeding, doctors finally discovered an angiodysplasia (an abnormal cluster of blood vessels) located at the entrance of the large intestine. A simple procedure to correct the angiodysplasia turned into a fight for his life. Mike had an allergic reaction to a drug used in the above mentioned procedure, which left his insides in shambles. Mikes entire small intestine, half of his transverse colon and appendix were removed because they were dead. The medical team gave Emily the horrifying news that he may not survive. The surgeon stated that he had hoped to never have been presented with a case like this. The odds were not in Mikes favor.There were five days after the removal of the small intestine when he was sedated, on a ventilator, and cared for in the ICU. He was placed in critical condition and the wait began to determine if he was going to survive. The completion of the third surgery presented doctors and family alike with truly miraculous news. He was going to make it. There is still a long road ahead for Mikes recovery peppered with a few unknowns. Mike has quickly squashed the thoughts of months of hospitalization and worries of missing out on the U of M Football season, or not working again entirely. Because of his stubbornness, so much support from family, friends and his linebackers he went home only 10 days after his first surgery. Not to mention he went home straight from the ICU, which is very unheard of. He went back to practice part time three days after going home, well technically one day since he went to a scrimmage at the stadium the day after discharge. Mikes dedication to his family and Gopher Football propelled him to accomplish this feat.What does this all mean? This means he cannot eat and mostly not drink. He can have tastes or small sips of liquids. His remaining gastrointestinal organs are not connected. He has a tube in his stomach that is connected to ostomy bags that drain the natural fluids the body produces. He receives his nutrition intravenously by Emily in a sterilized room in their home. He needs to be hooked up to his formula for 12 hours every day. He is recovering from four major and intensive surgeries. Down the road, we are hopeful that his stomach can be reconnected to his large intestine for the possibility of eating some food again. He is now working with the team at Mayo on a plan for his future. To say his and their daily life has changed and is about to change even more is an understatement.Mike, Emily, Valerie and Quinton are welcoming two babies into their family in March of 2017. Twinsidentical twin babies. They are over the moon with excitement but also know these sweet additions will bring with the demand of extra money, time, and baby gear.The Sherels family has had quite the summer. They have been blown away by the amount of support, prayers, texts, calls, meals, positive energy, cards and love that have been given. Many, many kind and generous people have asked what they could do to help support this family and therefore we have created this campaign. It is not at all in Mike and Emilys nature to ask for help this way and it is uncomfortable for them to be in this position. But this is the reality of their life moving forward. It will be very different and much more difficult.Funds generated from this campaign will go towards mounting medical bills  all work done at Mayo is out-of-network for their insurance; nutrition and supplies for Mike; diapers, wipes, bottles, formula, etc. for the twins; cost of expenses used to travel for multiple weekly hospital and lab visits; time and costs for Emily to travel with Michael for work (Emily has not been back to work since July 24th, meanwhile the children have still been attending day care); extra car seats for people helping with driving their kids; baby gear like bouncers, swings, materials to finish their basement for a bedroom so they have a place for guests who come stay in order to help with the children; snow removal help, medical room adaptations (door and recliner needed) and the list goes on.If you have found this page and have something else to offer, such as a skill or trade (ie. laying carpet, tiling, electrical work, or plumbing work) that would help their family out, they would gladly accept.

We received heart-breaking news that my beloved 3 year old nephew, Brayden Thomas Stacey has Craniopharyngioma. It isa golf ball size tumor in his brain near his pituitary gland and optic nerves. This was discovered after Brayden was grabbing his head and saying ""hurt"" when hearing loud noises and certain movements. We are so sad and sickened by this news. Everything is in the beginning stages but he will need brain surgery at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Although these types of tumors are usually benign, he will most likely needradiation and chemotherapy to fully remove the tumor.My sister Sarah, and brother-in-law Nick, met with an eye specialist yesterday and he unfortunately has some vision damage which could be permanent. They will meet with the Children's Hospital Brain Tumor Clinic Team on Wednesday as they determine the best plan to remove this tumor. It is going to be a very long week.As you can imagine, this is all going to be very expensive. In addition, Sarah and Nick have recently added to their growing family with Beckam who is 3 months old. As we learn more and move forward, I would like to make the financial burden less of a worry for them, as this should not be their concern right now. If you can help in any way, it would be deeply appreciated. Children are resilient and so much more positive and I know Brayden will bea champ through all of this. But it still hurts my heart, as I adore my nephews so much. Brayden loves his firetrucks, snuggles and family very much. Please help get this little man better!Please keep my precious Brayden, my sister and brother-in-law and our entire family in your thoughts and prayers.Thank you for your prayers, generosity and kindness.

This account is set up to help make a difficult situation a little less stressful for an amazing family that brings so much joy to so many of us. Natasha and I have been friends for 16 years and she is one of the most selfless people I have ever met. It's time for us to pull together and offer her family some financial support as they navigate through this crisis.Jermaine, Natasha's twin, was in a car accident in Hollywood, CA on Sunday, Sept 18, 2016. Jermaine is currently in ICU and remains unresponsive at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and his condition is being closely monitored. The main concern at this time is for swelling of his brain. The funds raised for this account will go to cover any medical costs not covered by Jermaine's insurance as well as ease the finanical burdens of his immediate family as they miss work and travel to be by his side. Jermaine's family has always been a priority to him. Let's help make it a little easier for those he loves the most to be by his side without worrying as much about finances.So many of us feel extremely helpless at this time; here's a concrete way, in addition to prayer, that we can help.On behalf of Jermaine's family (his mother, Denise Brown, his father, Kavan Brown, sister, Natasha Rachell and brother, Cristian Brown), I thank you in advance for your generosity and support at this time.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She was recently diagnosed with a vestibular schwannoma, a non-cancerous tumor on a bundle of nerves connecting her right ear to her brain. It is small and not applying direct pressure to her brain. She is having brain surgery to remove it next week. The road to recovery will be a long one with estimated 3 month recovery time. In February, she started to hear her heartbeat in her ear (tinnitus). Shortly after she lost her hearing permanently in her right ear. She struggled for months with severe vertigo and migraines, almost unable to function but that didn't stop her. She is going to school fulltime with a goal of earning her doctorate in physical therapy while working three jobs, one as a first mate on a tour boat, one working with people who have developmental disabilities, and another working with a woman who has MS. My sister means the world to me and my family. It is our hope that we can raise money for her recovery. We also hope to obtain a hearing aid that will transmit the sound from her deaf ear to her functioning ear to improve her quality of life. Adrienne is a kind and selfless person. I don't think there is anyone she isn't willing to help or donate her time to. Everyone that meets her loves her. I am asking those who love her to donate to show her your support. Even if you can only spare a few dollars. Every penny helps. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.

Jerry laid there, on the ground, with no feeling in his arms, for hours until his wife, Deb, got off work and found him. He was then taken by helicopter to OSF in Peoria with major injuries.

Please Help Alex's Family,"$66,941 ","$100,000 ",Medical," May 2, 2016",679,4,EAST AURORA,NY,2900,5,5,"                            Christine Breddy Tombleson                                                                                                                   EAST AURORA, NY                                My nephewAlexis a 9th grader at East Aurora High School. Up until February 17, 2016, he was a happy, healthy 14 year-old boy who was active in sports, playing for two hockey teams,was on the honor role in school, played the cello and enjoyed time with his family and friends. While visiting his grandparents in Florida, Alex complained of a neck pain. Within a few hours he was on his way to the hospital. By the time he got to the hospital he was completely paralyzed from the neck down and on a ventilator. The doctors determined that he had suffered a spinal arterial stroke, which is very rare, especially for a 14 year old. There was no accident, no incident, no warning. Alex's life, along with his parents' and grandparents', changed overnight. Alex spent a month in intensive care in Florida and two months at the Shepherd Center Hosptial in Atlanta for spinal cord injuries with both of his parents in the hospital room every single day and night attending to his care. To be with Alex, both of his parents have been out of work for the past six months since the stroke, with no paid leave. Alex's grandparents had to move back from Florida to New York to help take care of Alex's 11-year old brother, Zack.Many areas of Alex's and his family's lives will require sacrafices and changes to accomodate this new way of being. Alex's mom will stay at home to be one of his caregivers. The dining room is now a substitue hospital room. Alex will need 24/7 assistance with every aspect of daily function including eating, drinking, bathing, bladder and bowel control, brushing teeth, scratching his nose, changing clothes ... even breathing for the rest of his life. Alex will require a lot of assistive services and devices for things all of us take for granted. To be transferred from his bed to his wheelchair he must be hoisted with a lift. To breathe he has a trach tube connected to a ventilator. By the good graces of God, the love of our family and those who have been assisting us and praying for us, we hope to regain the most reasonable life for Alex and the rest of our family. Thank you to all of those involved who are thinking of those in need. You never give much thought to this type of assistance ever being needed, and being needed on a constant basis, until you live it yourself. The family will be humbly grateful for any help to cover the many costs that are not covered by insurance, including the many personal expenses accrued due to this heartbreaking, life changing event. Thank you also for all of your prayers! Below are pictures of Alex's new life followed bypictures of Alex, family and friends from before the stroke.Paralysis generates great risk of developing pressure sores because you cannot move to shift your body weight. Pressure sores can lead to very serious complications. Alex must be turned at regular intervals every day (and night); and requires a special mattress. Getting out of bed in the morning and back into bed in the evening is not a quick process and requires at least 2 people. Proper adjustment in the power chair is just as important to prevent pressure sores and pain. Alex cannot shift himself once in the chair. Alex cannot breathe on his own. He breathes using a ventilator, a machine that moves breathable air into and out of the lungs. The ventilator runs on batteries when Alex is in the chair. The bag on his leg collects urine which must be periodically emptied since bladder and bowel control has also been lost.Because Alex cannot cough on his own nor move around which dislodges materials in the lungs, he must have the fluids in his lungs suctioned out by a machine called a cough assist several times every day (including at night time).Therapy, therapy, therapy is very important but it can also be painful for Alex.Alex controls his power chair by ""puffing and sipping"" into a tube called a sip and puff.Zack, Alex's younger brother, reading a story to his brother. Zack feeding Alex a snack. Alex relies on his friends and family for all of his needs, even the little things we all take for granted. Getting a drink from Dad.Celebrating your 15th birthday with a fever :( No fun. Paralysis causes increased risk for different infections. Alex's vitals must be monitored regularly.Alex needs to tilt his body periodically throughout the day to help control his blood pressure which gets out of whack from his body not moving around. Before the stroke Alex loved playing hockey! He played on two teams.He enjoyed playing the cello with his brother and Grandfather.Enjoyed activities and friendship with his friends...Thank you for taking the time to read about Alex!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

At age 13 the diagnosis became clearer. She had SCID, Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. She had no T cells, no B cells, but she had T cell function. Savannah has spent her whole life in and out of hospitals and doctors offices. She has had to give herself weekly infusions, even twice a week for quite some time. Through it all she became an accomplished dancer, playing Clara in the Community Nutcracker and more importantly made straight A's all through school. It paid off when she graduated Valdectorian from Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. Through all of her medical issues Van (as we all call her) had one dream. It was to return to Duke where she was first diagnosed.  Savannah was accepted to Duke University to study pre-med and to eventually become a pediatric immunologist, treating children much like herself. Savannah has been at Duke for two years. Recently she began to be ill quite often. Her amazing physician rana test only to give us the bad news. Van's T-cell function has crashed. She must have a bone marrow transplant. It is not optional. Van is going to need the love, support, and care taking of her two moms Michelle, and Jill - who are teachers and two sisters Stella and Sofia. Her family lives in St. Augustine, Florida and the procedure will be done in Durham, NC. In order for the family to be with Savannah they will need to secure a place to stay, travel back and forth to Florida with her sisters, her mom has to go on family medical leave for 3 months where she will not receive a paycheck, they must continue to pay for health insurance, car payments, auto insurance, hospital bills, doctors co-pays, medicines, groceriesetc.Savannah is in the fight of her life. Her doctor referred to it as going to war. She will have to endure strong chemotherapy and then the transplant. She will be in isolation where her family will not be able to touch, hug, and kiss her for three months. However, this family is ready to fight, and so is Savannah. They are focused on what lies at the other end. A healthy Savannah. We are so appreciative of anything anyone can do to help us get through this time. We also appreciate your prayers and good wishes!

Please consider making a donation to support this family. Taking care of three children, household expenses and medical bills will be very difficult.-Thank you, MelindaBelow is an update on Sharon, written by her daughter Hannah Saturday night.As I write this update through an endless stream of tears, I have very grave news to report. On Thursday, my mother was health was still at a plateau. Her doctors ordered an MRI, and the results were devastating.My mothers brain damage was more extensive than originally thought. She had suffered a major stroke when her brain was swelling after her initial surgery. Unlike a clot-based stroke that typically starts in the back of the brain, a swelling-related stroke impacts the brain tissue itself, and in my moms case, started at the front of her brain (the portion that controls speech, cognition, etc.). Her entire left lobe and parts of her right sustained severe, irreversible damage. We were told that it was highly improbable that she would ever wake up, and even if she did, she would be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life.My mothers brain is what makes her the amazing and inspiring woman that she is today. My parents have always said that they would never want to be trapped inside of their own bodies if something like this were to ever happen.Today my family and I had to make the decision that no family ever wants to make. Tomorrow, my beloved mothers breathing tube will be removed, and hospice will take over her care. What makes the situation more difficult is that all of her organs, with the exception of her brain, are working well. We are not sure how long she will be in hospice, but we will be treasuring every second that we have left with her on Earth. Our goal is to transport her to a more local hospice center, but this is entirely dependent on her condition and hospital openings.Please continue to keep my family in your thoughts and prayers as we move through the most difficult time of our lives. Additionally we understand that many of you may want to come and say goodbye, but please respect these last few moments that my father, siblings and I have with my mother. If she is moved to a more local location, we will post hours for quick visits so that my family can enjoy the last little while that we have left with my mother.Thank you for all of the prayers, love and support that we have been receiving during this difficult time.

There will be lots of hospital visits, motels stays, more doctor's visits, and missed work for all the right reasons - to get Josh well. Although they have basic insurance, most of these expenses will not be covered. The McReynolds-Shumway family is humbled and incredibly grateful for the love and support of their caring ""rainbow"" of friends, family, coworkers and community, and will never be able to fully express the depth of their gratitude.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Their 25 year old son, Chris has recently been diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma, a type of childhood cancer. Unfortunately, the cancer has been found in many or Chriss organs and will require aggressive treatment. Chris has recently started a new job. Fortunately, his job will be protected under FMLA, but he will not receive pay while he is off receiving treatment. Ruth Ann and Tim will also be taking a lot of time off to attend treatments with Chris. Tim and Chris leave this week for New York to have his records reviewed and determine the best treatment plan for him at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ( https://www.mskcc.org) They have no idea what that will be and how long they will need to be in New York. Theyre hopeful treatments can be done at Nortons Hospital in Louisville. Fortunately, Chris is covered with health insurance. However, the drugs used to treat this aggressive cancer come with high copays. Also, the travel expenses and lack of wages will soon put a strain on the entire family. I know there are many of you that love the Hendrick family as much as I do and want to help ease their stress at this difficult time.

She was born at 23weeks 3days when my water broke by emergency c-section after I was taken from our local hospital to Magees in Pittsburgh pa by ambulance.. We were told she only had a 8-10% chance of surviving a few minutes after she was born.. They tried to get me to aboard her and I refused.. So they prepared me for the worst.. Well Ella came and they were able to get a breathing tube in her.. It was amazing with a lot of support my daughter was alive.. At just 1lb 02oz and 11 3/4in long she was very tiny.. Her first week of like she was stable then an infection set in and her lungs began to worsen.. We live two hours from the hospital and were called in to come be with her they didn't think she was gonna make it to much longer Ella stayed very critical for about 3weeks I was called in to the hospital one other time being told again they didn't think she was gonna make it.. At one point they had me hold her (it was the first and only time I've held her so far) because both her hart rate and oxygen levels were so low that they said this my be my only chance to told my daughter alive.. But like a miracle as soon as they placed her in my arms her numbers started rise. My tears of sadness turned to tears of joy! But soon her numbers dipped again. About a week ago the Drs came to me about starting steroids but with a heavy warning that they can cause brain damage but without them she wasn't gonna survive.. So we started them. Ella's oxygen levels have been good since and the doctors have been able to dramatically lower the setting and amount of support on her oscillator (a type of ventilator) she is also starting to grow, Ella is now 2lbs almost twice the size she was when she was born and finally again stable. Ella is truly an amazing strong fighter! We live about an hour and fourtyfive min. From the hospital. It's about a $20 round trip for gas, And we do make trips down everyday to take Ella fresh milk. At this point we are unsure what all the insurance with cover and what with be out of pocket.. A lot of unknowns so any support would mean so much at this point. If you are unable to donate it's ok, prayers, and just sharing this link would also mean the world!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

At a routine physical examination last week, the doctor discovered a lump in Avas abdomen. She was immediately sent to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and within hours Ava was diagnosed with Wilms Tumor, a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children, also known as nephroblastoma.  After having the tumor and her kidney removed a few days later, doctors discovered the cancer had spread to her other organs including her lungs and was now Stage 4 Rhabdomyosarcoma,a type of cancer, specifically a sarcoma (cancer of connective tissues), in which the cancer cells are thought to arise from skeletal muscle progenitors. Avas family was told she has a 20% chance of surviving. As you can imagine Ava's family's life has been turned upside down. One day everything wasfine, andwithin hours of finding this lump, their world changed forever. With only a week of this journey under their belts, Ava has already undergone one major surgery and has serious treatments ahead of her. The family is committed to changing Avas diet (and their own, as she is still breastfeeding) to a purely organic raw vegetable diet in an effort to starve the cancer, as it has been show that cancer feeds off sugar. Sincechemotherapy and radiation have been recommended, they want to be sure they are doing everything in their power to get Ava the best medical care and treatment possible, which includes trying to get her into St. Judes,a leading children's hospital pioneering research and treatments for kids with cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Ava's family knows their faith in God is their most powerful source to healing Ava and ridding this cancer from her body. This will be a lengthy and costly recovery process, and I am asking for your help to financially assist a wonderful family in their journey to saving Ava. It's hard to imagine receiving a cancer diagnosis for your child or grandchild. Melanie is Ava's grandmother, and my best employee ever. She has worked so hard to help me and my business grow over the past yearand I feel compelled to do all I can to help her and her precious grandbaby. This is the most tragic and draining situation a family could be put through. Please pray for them daily and contribute anything you can afford to help them achieve health and healing for Ava.

It is a disease in which malignant cells invade brain and spinal cord tissues. T.E.K Foundation CC, Inc. is a 501(c) 3 nonprofit dedicated to helping one child at a time, one day at a time, find strength and courage in the face of this disease, and to offer as much support as possible. Eric Erdman  the first recipient of educational information on childhood Ependymoma and financial resources  will continue his fight along with family, friends, neighbors, and strangers, because No One Fights Alone. Through one child at a time, we will continue to create an army of fighters behind Eric, and every child after him, via fundraising, donations, and grants. Tax ID No. 81-3605794Our StoryErichad to fight to be here and now he needs to fight to stay.As the youngest of six children, I always knew I someday wanted a family of my own. Nothing really prepares you for motherhood. You hear it described, but its not until you experience it that you realize there is truly no feeling more amazing. Nothing else in the world surpasses it.Its such a sacred gift to create a life, carry the child within you, feel the baby kick for the first time, and then finally hold him in your arms. The first time I felt my oldest  Tylor Michael Erdman  kick, it was like a really strong butterfly in my belly. Butterflies bring joy, and each one is unique in their own special way, just like each of my three boys.A year after Tylors birth, I became pregnant with twins. Tylor was so excited about having two baby brothers. We went shopping, decorated the nursery, and picked out the names Kyle Ryan Erdman and Eric Richard Erdman. I had everything ready by the time I was 20 weeks pregnant, and was bursting with anticipation. When the two babies kicked for the first time, it was like an army of butterflies within me.Then at week 20, I found myself in the hospital on complete bed rest, fighting for Kyle and Erics lives. At week 24, November 17, 1999, I went into labor and gave birth to Kyle, who weighed 1 pound, 8 ounces. The doctors prepared themselves to deliver Eric as well, but Eric decided he wasnt quite ready. Kyle was very weak, but he fought every day. When he was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill, PA, the nurses wheeled me in nightly  with Eric still in my belly  to see Kyle. Unfortunately, his organs eventually failed and the bleeding in his brain was just too severe. After 11 days of life, Kyle took his last breath on November 28. That same day, Eric was born, weighing just 1 pound, 15 ounces. No parent should ever have to experience the death of a child; it is true agony. How could I prepare myself to potentially lose Eric since he, too, had brain bleeding and underdeveloped lungs? All I knew was when you have a child, you fight for them  no matter what it takes. I now realize November 28, 1999, was also the day the T.E.K Foundation, CC Inc. truly started forming. Eric spent 3.5 months fighting in the NICU, eventually coming home on oxygen and a monitor. He required these for the first two years of his life. He also underwent multiple hernia operations, airway reconstruction, childhood alopecia, and struggled with asthma until age 12. Eric fought his way into this world and recently, on July 8, 2016, he underwent brain surgery to have an Ependymoma anaplastic grade III childhood cancerous tumor removed at the age of 16. And so, he begins yet another fight to stay in this life he loves so very much.As a result of the surgery, Eric was left with hearing and vision loss, coordination issues, difficulty eating, and constant headaches. The hospital sent Eric home so he would become strong enough to handle his scheduled radiation treatments. The worry and exhaustion from being at the hospital 24/7 and contemplating the road ahead showed on my face. Tylor looked at me and said, Dont worry Mom, Erics got this. I can help more this time. I'm older now  plus we have Cole and Chris. Cole Erdman is my boys' cousin, and Chris Zeigler might as well be related to our family. It's a profound moment when you realize your little boy is now a man  a man so courageous, so fearless, and with so much love in his heart. I stood silent for a minute and just looked in awe at this family of mine.Fourteen years ago, I earned the title of single parent when my ex-husband and I divorced. Living life as a single woman with two small children  one with extensive medical needs  has its challenges, yet I feel so incredibly lucky. We have found our way in this life with so much love to share. We managed to expand our little family with Cole and Chris, who have served as a tremendous support system for my sons. I am forever grateful for these two young men, and I now realize families come in all forms.When I watch these four boys interact, I see a bond that will never break. The support they offer to one another is an inspiration and serves as the premise for which we are fighting this fight. NO ONE FIGHTS ALONE!The T.E.K Foundation CC, Inc. is built on Eric Erdmans proven strength along with the loyalty, integrity and, most importantly, the heart of these four young men. We also cherish the memory of Tylor and Erics 's brother, Erics twin, Kyle Erdman.To my little family, I love you, and you are the T.E.K Foundation CC, Inc.

On her mother's side she has Grandma (Mimi) DeeAnn and Grandpa (PeePaw) Kane as well as two aunts (Conner and Morgan) and one uncle (KaneTyler). On her dad's side she has Grandma Sallyand Grandpa Doug.  Evie was taken to Blank Childrens Hospital on 3/28/16 after discovering a lump in the right side of her abdomen. Doctors in the E.R. did an ultrasound and found a mass in her liver. Evie was admitted for more testing. The next afternoon the results from Evies blood work and CT showed that Evie has a tumor engulfing 80% of her liver. The doctors diagnosed her with Hepatoblastoma, which is a rare form of childhood liver cancer. The physicians informed us that operating to remove the tumor is not an option right now, as Evie would not have enough healthy liver left for proper functioning. The next step is 4 rounds of chemotherapy over the course of four months to hopefully shrink the tumor enough to be able to remove it completely. Her first chemotherapy treatment is set to start on Monday 4/4/16. We arepraying that the chemotherapy will shrink the tumor enough to remove it, but if the chemo is not successful we will have to plan a liver transplant for Evie. Evie has a long road ahead of her, but doctors are hopeful that the chemotherapy will be successful. Evie is going to need 24 hr care with extensive medical bills. Together, we can take some of the financial burden away from this family. Please keep Evie Mae in your prayers! #GoTeamEvie                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

It may be a difficult process, but we believe in making a difference and we need to start now before time runs out.Afshins Story: Afshin Sohrabzadeh is a 25-year-old Iranian man and political prisoner. He was recently serving a 25-year prison term in internal exile at a remote prison in the south of Iran, for alleged charges of Moharebeh  translated as ""waging war against God"" which is considered a crime in Islamic law and a capital crime in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Afshin reportedly experienced severe torture during his interrogation in prison by Deputy Intelligence Service of Kamyaran. His nose was broken, he was given electroshock, burned by metal sticks and raped. He is now reported to be vomiting blood and suffering from grave respiratory problems. Amnesty International also reported:He was in urgent need of specialized medical treatment outside prison. He suffers from a life-threatening gastrointestinal condition, exacerbated by prolonged lack of adequate treatment. After much delay, some Iranian Human Rights organizations released a joint statement in support of Afshin. He finally received a 20 day medical furlough on June 25, 2016 was extracted to a safe house at that point.This campaign is designed as a rescue mission for Afshin, arranged by Live up to Freedom, founded by Aynaz Anni Cyrus. I (Anni Cyrus) am in direct contact with Afshin daily. All funds will be used for travel, food, shelter, paperwork fees and everything else needed. I will be withdrawing these funds,since I have to pay all the fees for the travel documents and retain a lawyer. The remaining funds will be delivered to him for future legal expenses. He will be going to Northern Europe, where we will reach out to the local government to gain him asylum. We are not affiliated with any government groups or federal grant money. We depend solely on private funding and the good will efforts of supporters like you to help those in critical situations. We are working through proper channels to get Afshin to safety, but we need funding to continue the process.Please help this man get to safety by donating personally or getting in contact with someone you know who can help us.At the completion and success of our effort, we will always do our best to have those we have helped make a personal testimony to verify the mission, so all of our supporters can rest assured that LUTF missions are genuine.Please note: The needed funding for this mission is $6500, but to cover deduction of 10% by gofund, we are asking for 7200.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

My sister Sara Melgar is 34 years old with three children ages 3, 5, and 7. She recently started having headaches and small seizures which prompted her to go into the doctor. After doing an EEG and MRI she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The location is in her left frontal lobe about 6 cm around. Since the tumor is so large it is pressing on a lot of important things, mainly her hypothalamus. They will be performing surgery on Monday, Novemeber 23 in Milwaukee. They have already told us that they are unable to take out all of the tumor and she will need at least one other surgery after this one. She will need radiation to shrink what is left after the first surgery and possibly chemo depending on what the pathology report comes back as. These surgeries will take her away from work for at least half of the year doctors are saying and her husband will have to take care of the kids. I have started this site to try and raise money for them and to help out with their three kids. Anything you are able to give would be very much appreciated. Please keep Sara is your prayers. Thank you!Stefanie Shookman                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Now, as she walks the halls of the cancer center and sees patients wearing crocheted hats, she realizes that she is now a patient, too. Several weeks ago, Myrna was diagnosed withearly stage breast cancer.This comes just four months after her husband was involved in a terrible bike accident that was broadcast all over the local news. He is still recovering from that accident and doing what he can to wrap his mind around the news that his beloved wife has cancer. Together they have fouramazing children. What else could they be other than amazing, with parents like Myrna and Marco?Currently, Myrna has her plate full as she runs an assisted living home for seniors, helps care for her father who has Alzheimers disease, and works as a teacher's assistant at TotSpot Preschool. She has never complained or slowed down a bit through her husband's accident and recovery. She has quietly pushed along doing what she can to help meet their growing expenses. Myrna plans to continue working for as long as possible, but inevitably will need to take at least a couple of months off for treatment and surgery. This family has had a heavy year indeed. Please consider donating even a small amount. Together we can wrap our arms around this hard working, humble family, and lift them up in their time of need. We love you Ms. Myrna!!!!The funds raised will go directly to Ms. Myrna. I am an administrator at TotSpot Preschool and am working side by side with the entire TotSpot family to help this family in any way that we can.

After some tests, they found her heart had a triple artery dissection that required immediate open heart surgery. She was airlifted to a hospital in downtown Colorado Springs and underwent a triple artery bypass. After about 24 hours, her heart was still not pumping enough blood to support her life. The doctors decided the best option would be for my mom to be sent to a heart specialty hospital in Denver. She was airlifted to the University of Colorado Hospital for a possible artificial heart pump placement in hopes that her heart will get stronger while on this support. Since arriving, her liver and kidneys are now failing. She underwent a second open heart surgery to place the artificial support to take over the job of her heart and lungs. She will be on this life support for up to 6 weeks to see if her heart can get stronger and support her body. If not, she will require a heart transplant.This has by far been the worst and most difficult time of my life. My mom has coded once which was the worst moment of my life. The doctors were able to bring her back, and over and over again my mom has fought and overcome it all. It is a miracle she is alive right now, and I honestly believe it is thanks to the many prayers from you all and the amazing doctors and nurses and health care workers that have saved my mom's life and continue to save it as we speak. We now have a long road ahead of us, and we are taking it one day at a time. We are trying to figure out how to financially get through the next few weeks as my Dad has to take off time from work, we have to find lodging up in Denver to be close to the hospital, my sister has to travel back and forth from Colorado Springs/Woodland park, and I (Miriam) will be coming back from Florida to help my dad and mom through this difficult time. I usually have way too much pride to ask for help or money from other people, but I don't know how we will get through this without the support from those around us. Even the smallest amount would help.. On behalf of my entire family, we are very thankful for the prayers and support you all have given us. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She is a ball of sunshine always smiling. But in May of 2014, her life changed forever. A very large mass was discovered in her abdomen. Doctors at the Macon Children's hospital decided the mass needed to come out immediately. Surgery took place and in less than 60hrs, it was determine as Cancer, specifically Neuroblastoma. A full work up of bloodwork and full body scans over summer were completed and Karma was considered NED (no evidence of disease) by August 2014. Her life returned to normal. She started pre-K and became joyful once again. Unfortunately, the end of September...Karma's cancer came back more aggressively than anticipated in the abdomen and in the lungs. She was airlifted to Egleston Children's Hospital in Atl. Once there Karma underwent a lung biopsy to confirm the cancer but her body gave out and she slept on support machines for alittle over a month. While on support, chemotherapy started. By the time Karma woke up, her image changed completely. In the year spent in Atlanta, Karma completed Frontline Protocol with varies rounds of high dose chemotherapy, mutation drugs, 2 more surgeries, cycles of direct radiation, and 1 cycle of full body MIBG radiation therapy. Karma had very little stable moments to progressive. With running out of options in ATL; her family decided in November 2015 to transfer Karma's care to Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research hospital in New York City where then is a very strong focus on Neuroblastoma. Now since December of 2015, Karma has completed another lung biopsy, 3 cycles of ICE chemotherapy, 2 more major surgeries, and 2 more cycles of full body MIBG radiation therapy while they await certain clinical trials to become available. Karma also completed an experimental scanning called MFBG to hopefully obtain better pictures of the tumors. But no luck. She is currently recovering from radiation and awaiting a stem cell possible bone marrow rescue/transplant. Karma was 3yrs old at diagnosed and is turning 6 this year. She's Stage IV High Risk Neuroblastoma. My job has been very understanding. At first I switched to the overnight shift so I could be with Karma during treatments and commute to/from work from the hospitals. But now since we are basically living in NYC doing clinical trials for 3 months now, I'm on an unpaid medical leave of absence.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Since his diagnosis, he has been undergoing aggressive treatment to suppress his cancer in order for him to be able to receive his upcoming transplant. This cancer has already compromised his bones and immune system.Scott will now be undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant at Mt. Sinai Hospital in NYC. During this time, Mindy and Scott will be staying in Mt Sinai Hospital for approximately one month. Scott and Mindy will need to stay in NYC for his entire treatment. Unfortunately, neither one of them will be able to work. This will put an enormous financial strain on this incredible family. Their monetary obligations will escalate during this time period; normal monthly house hold expenses, accumulating unreimbursed medical bills, and now additional lodging expenses in NY. Each donation they receive will enable Mindy to be by Scotts side during his treatment and for a time period upon his return home. Your support would be life changing for the Kubrin Family.Upcoming Treatment  Stem Cell/Bone Marrow TransplantI am humbly reaching out to ask for your help, as Scott is now entering his second phase of treatment. This treatment will take place at Mt. Sinai in NYC. His team of doctors will first harvest Scotts own stem cells. They will then administer a high dose of chemotherapy in order to destroy any remaining cancer cells in his body and wipe his entire immune system, in order to rebuild new and healthy stem cells in his bones/blood. They will then transplant his own stem cells back into his bone marrow. Mindy will be by his side during this long process in NY. Upon his return home, he will then have an estimated 3 to 4 months of recovery at home. During treatment and recovery he will be isolated from family and friends, as he will have no immune system. Family and friends from near and far will be staying with their children at their home during his time in the hospital. As we all know, it takes a village. The Kubrin FamilyScott and Mindy have been married for 20 years, and have four amazing children; Chloe (16), Lucy (13), Layla (10) and Jackson (8). The Kubrin family recently moved back to the Northeast, in Ridgefield, CT.This extraordinary family always seizes the opportunity to give back and pay it forward. Cancer has affected all of us - personally. Collectively, we can help the Kubrins conquer the financial consequences in their fight against cancer. The Kubrins, their friends, and family members appreciate any contributions beyond words. Your efforts will help take the financial challenge off of their long list of hurdles that they are enduring at the present time.Lucy, Chloe, Jackson & Layla Kubrin - May 2016EmploymentScott is expected to be out of work for possibly 1 year. Mindy has a wonderful job, but works on commission -100%. Therefore, when not at work, she does not get paid. In order to be there for Scott, she will be out of work for a couple of months. Upon Mindys return to work full time, we will close this GoFundMe account. If there are excess funds from donations received, this family will pay it forward to The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.

Shortly after this he joined the team of a new meal prep company which then folded... If that wasnt enough he had his knife set stolen from him, the tools he used daily for his craft. A month or so goes by, he has an interview for what he said would be a life changing Head Chef position for the Island Hotel in Newport Beach. He asked his friends and family for positive thoughts and prayers hoping for this new opportunity... He got the job! Things were finally starting to look up for Greg hours later the worst of it happened, Greg was in a tragic motorcycle accident that left him unresponsive at the scene. He was rushed to the hospital and thankfully was in surgery within 30 minutes, getting a craniotomy (surgical opening into the skull). He is in a coma. At this point we are waiting for Greg to wake up and see if he responds to commands. This is going to be a long and very costly recovery process. The goal is to raise money to cover Gregs medical bills, replace his knife kit and give him a cushion to help him pay his normal bills while in recovery, so that he can take the proper time to heal and not feel worried/rushed to get back to work (even though we all know he will be eager to!).Greg has become one of the top chefs in Orange County, with time I have no doubt he will be among the best in the state followed by the country, any one that has ever had his creations knows that he is gifted! He is also, one of the most kind hearted people I know, if I were in his shoes I know he would be doing this for me. Calling all friends, family, colleagues and YOU, the caring person that doesnt even know Greg. In this time of need, we need to join together to help Greg fight! Sending prayers and positive thoughts his way. He is a fighter and will keep fighting, so lets fight for him and raise money to support the amazingly talented Chef Greg Moro!

My name is Amy Piper and I am a friend of Anne Wissman. I have had the privilege of working closely with her at Florida Hospital Tampa. She is an amazing nurse who has given endlessly to her patients. Annes husband Bill is also in the medical field and works as a respiratory therapist at St Josephs Hospital. Both are team players and well-loved and appreciated in the clinical setting. Now, it is our turn to give back to this wonderful family. As many of you know, Anne delivered a beautiful baby girl on Friday September 16th at 9:40pm that they named Everly. Shortly after delivery, they began to notice that Everly was very sleepy and not eating as well as expected. Concern for infection, metabolic issues or other cause quickly began to be investigated. After a visit from Dr. Rodgers (a Neurologist at FHT), the decision was made that it would be best to transfer Everly to All Childrens Hospital in St Petersburg Florida. Anne and Bill knew that this was the absolute best option for Everly. Everly arrived late Saturday the 17th to All Childrens and the investigative work up began quickly. They are in the process of completing an extensive amount of genetic testing, an MRI of her brain as well as a LP to evaluate for infection. Everly continues to remain sleepy however has shown some improvement. They continue to attempt to give her bottle feeds (Anne is pumping breastmilk) and Everly also has a feeding tube to help meet metabolic and nutritional needs. Everlys labs have also reflected some elevation in her liver enzymes. Further workup has been negative so it is currently being monitored closely. Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers at this time as to why Everly is so weakbut, the Wissmans are confident that the answer is close. They are very hopeful and positive and eager to begin the healing process for Everly. Anne and Bill are so grateful for all the support they have received from friends, family and their work community. They are appreciative for all the text messages, phone calls, emails and Facebook messages. They are thrilled with the care that they received at Florida Hospital and are so impressed with the nurses and physicians at All Childrens. Given the distance of their home in Riverview to the hospital they have also been given a room at the Ronald McDonald House. Given all this support, they are still facing some challenges. The medical bills are building and Bill just started his new position as a respiratory therapist at St Joes. He does not have any vacation time accrued yet so, he is doing his best to maintain as many shifts as he can while continuing to support his family in the hospital setting. They also have a lengthy commute that they are making at least twice a day in order to keep things normal for Arlea. Arlea, their three year old daughter is doing well. She misses her mommy and is so anxious to meet and spend time with her sister. Today, Anne is spending the morning with her followed by a visit to see Everly this afternoon. Everly also kept her eyes open this AM for quite some timea positive sign for sure!!!So, lets all continue to support the Wissman family through our prayers and positive thoughts. Keep the encouraging messages and texts coming. Anne has told me how wonderful it has been to receive all the caring words even though it has been difficult for her to keep up with responses. I assured her that this was not necessary that we all understood how crazy her days are right now. If you are able to contribute financially, any amount would be appreciated. Thank you so much for reading this update. I will do my absolute best to keep them coming.as well as some more beautiful pictures of Baby Everly!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

On Tuesday I introduced my new grandson Bentley and said Mama and baby doing well. By 6:00 p.m. Tuesday evening all of that had changed. My 29 year old daughter Amanda had life threatening complications and went into cardiac arrest twice and possibly suffered a heart attack. I had left the hospital and by the time I got back I was told that she had coded twice (her heart had stopped) and they didn't expect her to make it. They put myself and my son in a room with the Chaplin, and when they bring in the Chaplin you know its not good. There were a good 25 medical personal surrounding her, she was transported by special life supporting ambulance to another hospital where we followed and our nightmare began. The first 48 hours doctors didn't give us much hope. She was on life support, oxygen tube down her throat and sedated. Her blood pressure was so low, her kidneys began to fail and she developed venus blood clots throughout, several of which were in her left arm. I began to notice small bruces on her left wrist and within a few hours it was completely purple way past her wrist and the hand was swollen to 3 or 4 times its normal size. Surgery was needed on her abdomin and her wrist but the doctors determined that she was not stable enough to go into surgery. We were told at that point that her left hand would most likely have to be removed. By morning her kidneys had completely failed and we were in even more jeopardy of losing her if they didn't get her on dialysis. It seemed like forever before they could get her hooked up on dialysis and every minute that past was excrustating. After she had been on dialysis they brought in an OBGYN Surgeon that normally removes cancer. He told me that her abdomen was full of blood and it was causing pressure to her kidneys and causing them to shut down, and that all her organs were slowly shuting down. He said he needed to do surgery to drain the blood, and remove her uterus, but could not guarantee us she would make it, but a worse prognosis if we didn't have surgery. I signed for the surgery not knowing if I had just signed my daughter's life away. In the meantime I was contacted by phone by the hand surgeon they had called in and he wanted to take her left hand. I broke down and cried and begged him not to take my 29 year old daughter's hand. They just kept saying to me we have to save her life, and I cried and begged him, ""save my daughter's life and then save her hand"". He called me back and said he was going to be in the OR room and when they finished her abdomin he would do hand surgery and try his best to save it by doing a procedure where you split the arm wide open on both sides from elbo to hand to release the pressure. We are blessed to be able to say that Amanda lived through the abdomen surgery and the hand surgery. She has been in ICU since then. Her kidneys had continued to fail and she continued to be on dialysis. She also had developed fluid in the lungs. As of yesterday Amanda was off of the breathing tube, off of the dialysis and her kidneys are functioning on their own. They finally lifted the sedation and she was devasted to look down and see her arm. She was crying for her baby and didn't understand how she came to the hospital for the happy occassion of having a new son, and had not only almost lost her life, but was now in jeopardy of losing her hand. It is wrapped in huge layers of gauze and drains blood constanly which soaks through and has to be changed. She just kept looking at it and crying and asking ""what happen to my hand? Is my hand still there?"".Today at noon she will have her second surgery on her wrist to try and close it up more so the bleeding will stop. I don't know at this point how many surgery's she will have on it, but we have a long ways to go. Although she is off life support, she is not out of the woods.The hospital released her beautiful baby boy to me yesterday, her dream of taking her son home from the hospital gone. I did take him to visit her and it was beautiful. She is aware now of what all has happened and it is heart breaking. She is a stong young woman but she has a long road to recovery ahead of her and will be unable to bond and care for her infant son for quite some time. Amanda will be hospitalized for weeks to come, have physical therapy on her arm, and we have no idea what use she will have with it at this point. Amanda is alone, does not have a partner in this. On top of everything else, she suffered domestic violence 3 days before Bentley was born and we had moved her home with us just this past Sunday. I have never asked anyone for a penny in my life. My Daddy raised me proud and taught me never to take charity and to work for everything you get. But today I come to my friends, family and strangers asking for help for my daughter and her infant son Bentley. I would tell you its the hardest thing I have ever done, but it is not. The hardest thing I have ever done is living through these last 4 days. Please if you can donate to help Amanda and little Bentley it would mean so much. If you can't donate, please share this page so that others can. I can't tell you what it would mean to Amanda to be able to help her and Bentley get through this and start over.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I am Jon's sister, Tammy.     I, like many of you, heard in disbelief and sadness about the mass shooting in San Bernardino, on December 2nd. I was actually at work and talked with my co-workers in length about how tragic the event was. I didn't even think to text my brother, Jon Reid, an Environmental Health Specialist with the County of San Bernardino. I knew that he didn't work in that building...Jon went to work that morning, like he had for the last 11 years. With a B.S. in Biology, Jonathan fostered a career with the San Bernardino Department of Public Health, environmental health division. His wife, Genifer, a stay at home mom of two beautiful kids, recalled , ""he was particularly handsome that morning. ""He had a new shirt and tie on"", as he kissed her and his kids, 6 and 3 years old, goodbye.Jon was critically wounded during the horrific mass shooting that day. He was shot 7 times with assault rifles, some shots at close range. He was shot 3 times in the chest, twice in the back and 1 on his hip and another on his leg.One of the bullets hit a pulmonary artery, causing massive bleeding-ultimately causing him to lose close to 30% of one lung.Other bullets entered and exited his body with such force that his shoulder, hip and ribs were broken from the impact.We later found out that Jon's condition was so grave when he arrived at ER, they lost his pulse. Only a matter of minutes in circumstance or decisions, made the difference in Jon's life.He was rushed in for emergency surgery, where doctors did not have the time to CT scan him. Jon was opened up from arm pit to armpit and then again from his breastbone down through his abdomen. He would endure 4 major surgeries in the next 3 days and would be given 16 units of blood, in an effort to stabilize him.     (I learned that the average person only has 10 units)He was intubated (breathing tube), had a feeding tube and remained critical in ICU for 7 days. He was moved to a step down care unit and eventually transferred to the rehab hospital.We have so many people to thank and we are so grateful that Jon is alive and making progress everyday in his recovery. But not without struggle. He deals with pain everyday. Finds it hard to even sit comfortably. He has doctor's appointments every day of the week and will need continuous physical rehab until he acheives normal use of his leg and arm. No one is sure if he will ever have full use of his right arm again. He has had to go through speech therapy to regain use of his voice, after having his vocal cord paralyzed, as well.The family would like to thank everyone for their support and love. We feel so thankful for the visits, meals, help with errands, babysitting and most of all for the care, love and concern rallied around Jon. People have asked how they can help in other ways and that is why we decided to set up this GoFund me page. We are not sure when he will be able to return to work and any little bit will help give them the safety net they need.+ Read More"

Melanie is a wonderful wife and mother of two girls. In August Melanie started experiencing painful lymph nodes and after a biopsy was completed, she was diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma. Melanie has chosen a great doctor from the University of Chicago for treatment. Melanies treatment plan includes 4 months of Chemotherapy with 2 rounds each month. Unfortunately, this is not the only medical issue that Melanie is dealing with. In 2009 Melanie was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome which causes uncontrollable and dangerous arrhythmias to the heart. Shortly after she was diagnosed, she had a pacemaker put in to help control the arrhythmias. Both of Melanies girls were also diagnosed with the same syndrome and require medication and constant monitoring. As we all know, health insurance is not what it once was and we are all required to pay a lot more for even small procedures. The Orrs medical bills are increasing with this new diagnosis of Cancer. Both Melanie and her husband Tony are very hard working and have never once asked for help. With Melanie's health being the focus of the family's concern, any donations to help relieve the burden of the mounting medical bills would be greatly appreciated by the Orr Family.+ Read More"

He had spinal surgery a few weeks ago and it has left him unable to walk.  Dad is in a rehab facility working hard to go home, but there are many things needed to facilitate that. The goal is for him to be able to go home in two weeks. During that time, there is a lot for my mom to purchase and get ready. While he does have insurance, there are major items not covered. One of the most important is a specific exercise bike recommended by his physical therapists. The bike itself is $5000. In order to give him the best chance of regenerating nerves, he greatly needs this bike. There will be many other items needed to modify my mom and dads' home and to get a vehicle they are able to transfer him into. It has all been very overwhelming. I am hoping to ease some of their financial burden by reaching out for help here.  Any contribution is greatly appreciated and will help make his transition home a little easier.

To pretend that things like this don't happen is to dishonor their story, their life and their struggle to survive. So we apologize if it offends or bothers you but it does the same to us. But you can help make it better! Read Skimble's story below and see how you can help him.Skimble came to us when someone on social media was networking him and someone sent us his post. A kind man rescued him from a bad area on the streets of Los Angeles. He couldn't do what so many others had already done, walked by this poor helpless soul. He scooped him up and took him to a vet where Skimble was diagnosed with cryptococcois (you can read more about it here  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2134&aid=254) which is a fungal infection. The good Samaritan didn't have the funds, medical ability or space to take Skimble so they asked us to take him. As you can see his infection is VERY severe. We don't know how long Skimble wandered the streets like this but we couldn't turn him away when we were asked to take him. Other rescues said ""no"" not because they don't care but because of his condition and the cost involved in helping to save him. His condition will be life long and we hope that he recovers and spends a long and healthy life with us in our Lifetime Care Program.Until we can make that happen he needs very expensive medication ($70/month) regular blood tests to check his liver as the medication can cause damage to the liver and he needs to see a specialist (we have an appointment on Saturday). We need your help, just like with Tommy we think that Skimble's life is worth something, he's incredibly sweet and gentle and he is trying so hard to survive this infection. Can you help us help him with a tax deductible donation to Skimble's fund? We so appreciate it and with your help we can give this angel a fighting chance.Thank you as always for your, love prayers and support.                    + Read More"

We are the pastoral family in San Diego CA. He loves God, life, and the people around him. Pablo is a loved, happy, enthusiastic, spiritual and faithful leader. He was studying and working as any young guy would when suddenly last November, he fell tremendously ill with a very bizarre illness called hypereosinophilic syndrome. This syndrome makes the immune system work too much and produces a lethal amount of antibodies. These levels get so high, that they attack multiple organs and lead to multiple organ failures. He was close to death in December. That's why he has to be treated with cortisone and quimotherapy. This medication has sever side effects and the insurance hasn't approved the alternate medication which doesn't have the side effects. Since then, he has been in and out of the hospitals with apparent recoveries, all to come back to the hospital within a month or two. As his immune system is oppressed, he is susceptible to many infections. He's got pneumonia twice, a near-death abscess in the throat, and all alongside terrible body pains leaving him barely walking. We need your help. These hospitalizations have come with a high price tag for the family. We would forever thank you for any support. Fore each donation, we would also ask for much needed prayer.

I don't ask for help, I like to be the helper. But here we are; we need the help. My adoring husband of 17 years needs a kidney. I'll do anything to help this man, to break the terrible family curse that took his sister at 28, his mother at 38 and his farther at 48. A man should not go though so much loss and have to deal with his own health crisis year after year. Those who have followed along may or may not know the story. After being diagnosed as Type 1 diabetic shortly after his mom passed Eric was a scared 11yr old boy dealing with a new world without a mom. Health problems have plagued his life and here we are. in 2014 Eric spent 8 days in the hospital, most in ICU. His kidneys were failing, caused his heart to almost fail too. We're still paying for those bills. On April 24th a tendon spontaneously ruptured in his shoulder. That can happen with kidney failure, a sign of troubled times ahead. Eric's job working for Sears in home appliance repair won't work with a busted shoulder, he went out on short term disability; he's been out ever since.On Sunday May 1st something was wrong, Eric was tired and dizzy, had to sit down in the middle of the grocery store for fear of passing out. As the night wore on something wasn't right. Finally thinking of his blood pressure we checked, it was scary. 198/100 and it went over 200 by the time I did a Google search and realized he could be having a stroke; off to the ER we went in the middle of the night. After some drugs & a stroke test the admit him, his BP is too high and he needs to be watched. Tuesday I think he'll go home, just 1 last new drug and if he tolerates it he's out in the morning. Overnight things fall apart. He spikes a high fever, his BP goes sky high again, he's vomiting non-stop, he's in bad shape. It's an infection, after a few scary days its diagnosed as MRSA. It came in through his IV in his arm, it happens, it's a HAI and there is nothing we can do. Blood clots, fluid in the lungs, risk of pneumonia, swelling, vomiting, swollen stomach & esophagus, pain ravaging his body and there is nothing we can do. The infection is killing his kidneys, the drugs to save his life are going to kill what's left of his kidneys. May 5th a central line is put in to administer the drugs. The doctors have no choice, they give the drugs and by May 7th they give us the bad news ... he needs a transplant. By May 8th he start dialysis. In the mean time another procedure to put in a port. It's hard on the body, he's in bad shape. He's been so out of it through all of this he has no memory of about 8 days, which is a good thing. May 14th he's finally able to go home. He starts dialysis 3 days a week locally while he finishes his 6 weeks of antibiotics to clear the MRSA infection. I'm out of work during this taking care of him, my sister pay the expense to fly my mom in to help. Fast forward to June 15th and he finally finished the antibiotics and is healthy enough for surgery for his permanent dialysis port. He's in pain but healing once again. A few weeks to go before he can get to home dialysis, he likely won't return to work until end of July. That's 3 months out of work, with medical bills piling up. Plus the added costs of going back & forth to the hospital. The best kidney transplant team in the country is in San Antonio, so it's worth the drive. It's 2 hours away, we're going to need lots of trips. That's going to be extra gas, tolls, food on the run, everything.With the work I missed I'm missing my goals, which means no bonus when I need it most. With the work he's missing he's on limited pay, no OT and no commissions. Bills are mounting fast and before things get out of hand I need to ask for help. Prayers are free, I'll keep taking as many of those as we can get. It has warmed our hearts seeing the outpouring of love & support from those near & far. I love each & every one of you.

This Wednesday, July 6th. Im still having a difficult time wrapping my head around that statement. With much urging from some loved ones, Jared and I decided to extend our discomfort with further widespread sharing of our personal business by starting this gofundme page. Since Ive already made the difficult leap to share this intimate news with the masses of all of our circles via Facebook and beyond, I figure I may as well share more details of my tale so far. Heres the craziness of the past several weeks for us:In mid-May I noticed an indented area on my right breast when I raised my right arm. I immediately made an appointment on May 18th, the lump was confirmed and I was referred to Carol Milgard Breast Center. On May 24th I went in for a mammogram and subsequent ultrasound. There turned out to be a small questionable area that we agreed was best to biopsy to be sure it was nothing. The biopsy was done May 27th. Things were moving so fast! Then the waiting happened. It was an eternity while waiting for pathology report. What was supposed to be a few day turnaround became 5, 6, 7 then 8 business days. June 9th was a day of varying news: While sitting with Jared in my doctors office waiting for the pathology report, I was offered (and accepted) a great new job at the school I was hoping for! 5 minutes later, our joy became devastation, confusion, numbness, angerrage. Nothing prepares you for the news you are most scared to hear. Despite the numerous best and worst case scenarios I played and replayed in my head over the weeks and the constant pep talks I gave myself that Id be ok no matter what, hearing the words, Well I dont have the best news for you was an absolute gut punch like nothing Ive ever felt. They get it right in the movies when time seems to slow down and the edges of the world get blurry while the character tries to absorb traumatic news. I could see her mouth still moving, on to other information, as her first few words to us echoed in my head. Jared held on tight to my hand.TYPE OF CANCER: Invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. Tumor size approx. 14mm I lost track of how much time Ive stared at those words in shock, those first three words on repeat in my brain.This wasnt happening to me. To us. It couldnt be. Im still dealing with some lingering symptoms from my TBI and only just got back to teaching this last schoolyear. Jared just quit his job to go to grad school to become a teacher like me. Classes began June 20th. Things were supposed to be on the up and up. I wanted this to be the year Jared rocked through grad school and Charmaine landed a great job with no other major obstacles. This must be a sick joke. Its not? Seriously??? Well, screw you universe! This isnt right. Please do not think that Im feeling self-piteous. Im mostly pissed. Any sadness I have is for my kids and my husband who do not need another mom thing to worry about. Theyve had enough worry in their lives and I feel this is bullshit. It is bullshit and it will not win.I next made the MRI appointment and saw my new-to-me breast surgeon on June 13th to discuss my diagnosis and next steps. Jared and I walked out of that office feeling surprisingly more confident. It appeared that I just had run of the mill breast cancer. The tumor was small so I would likely just need a lumpectomy, some radiation and hormone pills for the next 5-10 years. We needed to wait for MRI results to confirm the margins of the tumor. I was sent home with a bag full of information and a pre-op surgery kit for lumpectomy. The next time I saw my new surgeon was to be for my lumpectomy. My MRI was 2 days later on the morning of June 15th. Results were in before 2pm. My doctors office called with a 3:30 appointment. The speed of the process this time was alarming. Again, Jared and I anxiously waited in the doctors office. Bad news. The small tumor wasnt the 2cm size we thought. Looks like we were only seeing the tip on the initial imaging. The tumor actually fans out toward my chest wall and measures over 8 centimeters. There is also a second tumor measuring almost 4 centimeters and several other smaller areas of concern. Mastectomy was recommended as the course of action. After much thought and discussion with my doctors, a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction is what will happen Wednesday, July 6th at St. Josephs Hospital. Were not entirely sure what is next. My treatment plan depends on the pathology of my tissue and lymph nodes. Im praying the cancer has remained localized and I dont have to do chemo. Prayers for that please.Am I terrified? Without a doubt. Do I feel more confident knowing I truly have a terrific army of supporters at the ready to jump in and help however they can? Absolutely! Jared and I are totally awestruck by our growing supporters and hope you all know that simply the love of every single one of you helps to hold us together right now. Thank you all so much.

A Voice and Mobility for Benni,"$2,400 ","$50,000 ",Medical," September 22, 2016",26,2,VERONA,WI,235000,,1,"                            Stephie Wied Hedlund                                                                                                                   VERONA, WI                                                        Benni is almost 3 years old and has a very rare genetic mutation. So rare, that there is only one other child known to share his same diagnosis.Benni is a smart, sweet, and happy boy. It is easy to make him smile and his laughter is heartwarming. He loves it when his friends play with him, his favorite things are going to the zoo and holding hands with his little sister.Benni developed normally until he was about one year and a half old, at which point his parents observed that he started walking differently. After many doctor visits, painful tests, trial medications, moments of hopeful and dreadful waiting, Benni was finally diagnosed with a mutation of the VAC14 gene.For Benni this means that his muscles are getting weaker and weaker. Once able to walk and talk, Benni now cannot sit on his own or speak any words. He can still slowly feed himself and turn his head or point at something to communicate.Benni is receiving a monthly infusion that has been successful in slowing down his regression. But since his disease is so rare there is not much knowledge about treatment or prognosis.With this GoFundMe Project, we are hoping to1. Enable Benni to communicate better2. Enable Benni to stay mobile3. Contribute to the cost of research1. Communication: We would like to purchase a device/computer program that will help Benni to communicate basic things like how he is feeling, what he would like to eat and drink, what he would like to do etc. And he would need to be trained in how to use such an ""Augmentative and Alternative Communication"" device. This would greatly reduce frustration in communication for him and his caretakers.2. Mobility: We are hoping to improve Benni's mobility inside the home and outside. We would like to buy a wheel chair that fits Benni's needs (cost: about $10,000). Maintaining mobility for Benni would also include adapting a car for easier transportation, as well as lifting and walking devices which would also be a support to Benni's parents and care takers.3. Research: Since Benni's disease is so rare, there is not much research about it. Donations to this GoFundMe Project could go toward research and hopefully speed up the discovery of possible treatments that Benni could benefit from. There are researchers in Michigan and Oregon who are trying to develop therapies including gene therapy to help children with mutations like Benni's.We can't thank you enough for any amount you are willing to give to support Benni and the whole Buehring family!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

His parents Joe & Kellie (my sister) lost a little girl at birth after a struggle with fertility, then, a little over a year later, they were blessed with Kyle. This kid is funny, smart, respectful and has the biggest heart. He ran a mile at school yesterday morning, then had a single symptom that prompted his parents to take him to the ER where the unimaginable happened. A very large mass was located on one of his kidneys and he was transported via ambulance to Children's Hospital Oakland where he will undergo surgery Friday morning to remove the kidney and mass. Chemotherapy will likely follow along with whatever the team of Doctors determine is best. Kyle's parents need to be by their child's side through this battle and need some help. Joe works for an agency that does not pay SDI and he and Kellie will run out of sick time and still need to continue to pay for their medical benefits & all of the expenses that this will entail. They have another young son, Wyatt as well. I know its a lot to ask, and I realize there are so many great causes and needs, etc out there. If you can help them in any small way, it is very appreciated. If you can not help monitarlily please keep this family in your hearts and prayers.

He was rushed into emergency surgery where he had several doctors operating on him to save his life. We know now by the doctors that we almost lost him three times during surgery. When my mom and stepdad arrived to the hospital, still not knowing what was going on, they were taken into a small room where the doctor began to tell them the devastating news. He was stabbed in his chest above his heart, in his stomach by his liver, in his back by his spine, in his left leg three times through and through the muscles front and back and his finger was almost completely severed off. But the most devastating and lethal stab was in his brain damaging his brain and eye. As they got updates from the doctors working on him, they said, he could of suffered a stroke from the stab to the brain. That there is no chance that he will be able to see out of his right eye again. When I was informed of the news by my mom I was completely overwhelmed and still am. After 10 hours of surgery we were finally able to see him in ICU. The monster who did this stabbed him 13 times in almost every area that could of been lethal. My immediate family is very small, consisting of just a handful of family. We aren't the type of family to ask for help because we figure things out on our own the best way we can, but we need your help this time. My mom and stepdad have been facing their own financial difficulties. My mom works a part time job that only allows her so many hours a week for not a lot an hour. My stepdad has been unemployed for a few months due to the downturn of the oil and gas industry here in Louisiana. He's been applying for jobs that he would of never thought he'd be applying for. His whole life and career has been involved in the oilfield, like most families down here are. Knowing all of this, I am worried of what they will have to face now that my brother will need their full time care and will have medical/therapy expenses and psychiatric help. My brother Chris is 22 years old and loves to skateboard. In fact, he's pretty good at it! He was a healthy active young man that will now have to possibly live with a disability the rest of his life and go through therapy for an extensive amount of time and not be able to work and earn a living. He doesn't have medical insurance due to the fact that he worked part time jobs. My family and I are overwhelmed and trying to take this one day at a time because that's all we can handle. All we can do is pray and wait to see how his body heals as time goes by. We appreciate all the people who have been so concerned and praying for Chris and my family. As many people have asked how they can help, and to help my family and Chris to prepare for any financial impact, I have created this go fund me account. It would mean so much to us if you could help in any way. Thank you and please continue to pray for Chris and my family. The funds donated will help support Chris and my family with various expenses like medical and therapy, loss of work and psychiatrist's the doctor said he will need due to the brain injury and ptsd. My goal is in reducing the trauma Chris and my family is going through with some monetary assistance. We hope you will consider donating. However long this may take we will actively believe that our Christian will receive justice and be healthy again.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

This form of brain cancer has no known cure.This all began when we discovered that Chase's right eye suddenly wasn't working quite right so we took him to an ophthalmologist on 2/4/16, the day after his 9th birthday. After the exam a first set of MRI scans were immediately taken and reviewed. Currently Chase has undergone a second brain MRI, spinal MRI, blood tests and a lumbar puncture to retrieve spinal fluid. All tests for any other condition (Lyme, MS, etc) have come back negative and the scans further support gliomatosis cerebri (GC). He's been a complete angel through ALL of it and we are getting strength from him. This Friday (March 4th) he is scheduled for a brain biopsy at Sloan Kettering in NYC. This procedure will provide the final diagnosis and determine a course of action.GC is very rare and only 100 cases appear annually so there is not a lot of research on how to treat it effectively. It is largely inoperable, not very respondent to chemo and radiation, and at this time ""universally"" fatal. The average patient lives 1-2 years from diagnosis.We are terrified, stunned, heartbroken, and struggling to handle this crushing prognosis for Chase, who is a ray of sunshine and makes people around him happy on a daily basis.We are blessed with a strong and supportive family, a group of friends we would never trade, and a small town that rallies to support families in need. In less than a month we have been more than overwhelmed by the thoughts, prayers, , food, visits, hugs, and open ended giving from those who love Chase. We are truly in awe and grateful. Our Family Request:We ask only that you be very careful not to discuss this with your children. Please let us explain. His understanding of what is happening to him is that the best doctors are trying to find the bad part of his brain that is affecting his eye. As his parents our burden is to shield him from unnecessary fear and worry. Children are innocent and share information with one another. It would be EXTREMELY upsetting to find out that a class mate confronted Chase with details unknown to him or his brother Ryder.How you can Help:Through this fight our family needs to be together with Chase as much as possible, not far away behind a desk pushing paper. There undoubtedly will also be unforeseen medical expenses. Your contributions can and will help.You can:    Give through gofundme.com   Give directly to Chase's Fund(link will be added at later date) and  You can buy a really COOL shirt, or mug,Design by Chase!

Biopsies and test were done, and thankfully they came back benign. She went on to have several other lumps found and was educated on the dangers and possibilites of breast cancer being able to form. She always kept a close check because of this. Over 10 years passed and she and her husband, Brett, had a beautiful baby boy named Carson.In May 2016, Natalie found yet another breast lump, but this time is was in the opposite breast. Also, this time it felt different. She called to schedule with her OBGYN and the soonest they had available was 1 month out. She took that appointment, but then realized it fell during the week she was out of town, so she reschduled it for the following week.At the appointment, they checked the lump and scheduled screenings. They did a mammogram and sonogram. By the end of the screenings they had asked Natalie's husband, Brett, to come back to speak with the Dr. They both had a sinking feeling within them that something was not right. After watching the behavior of the nurses and doctor, Natalie asked, ""just lay it on me, is it bad?"" By their behavior, she knew what the speculations were. They performed a biopsy that same day. Two days later, July 29, 2016, Natalie's doctor called to tell her the biopsy results. She had Invasive Mammary Carcinoma, stage 2. A double mastectomy was scheduled for 2 weeks out, Friday August 12. During the 6 hour surgery, the doctors took biopsies of several lymph nodes to see if any cancer had spread. The following day, the results were back from biopsies of lymph nodes and they found cancer in one of the lymph nodes that were taken, which then bumped her cancer stage up to a slight stage 3.Natalie's treatment plan is to start chemotheraphy in September, now followed by radiation, because of the cancer found in the lymph nodes.Natalie has remained very positive, with a fighting attitude througout this whole process. She has anchored herself in the hope that is set before her. She has been meditating regularly on Romans 8:28 [for all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose.] She will beat cancer and she will use her experience for the glory of God.We appreciate all of the loving support of our family, friends, and co-workers during this journey. You have been so kind and generous in your love. There is still a long ways to go, through February 2017, but she will win this battle.Your gift of any amount will be humbly received by Natalie, as your generosity will help in medical expenses. Many of you have asked ""how can I help?"" and your prayers and thoughtfulness have been enough, but many of you have also asked to help in this way and she greatly appreciates it from the bottom of her heart.We love you and thank you!~The Perry & Chalker Families                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

This is a long overdue change in my story. As most of you know, I recieved the best Christmas gift ever, when I got my lung transplant on December 18. I did fine for about a week, then completely crashed and almost didn't make it. I'll spare you all of the details, but I was on life support for 22 days and in ICU for nearly six weeks. That's all in the past and I've been home for a couple of months doing physical therapy, getting my strength back, and closing in on leading a normal life again. I already am able to do so many things I never thought I would do again and have so much more to look forward to! First, I need to thank my donor. I don't know who he is, but by signing up to be an organ donor, he saved my life. I don't know if I could have done this without all of you. The generosity of my friends and business associates blew me away. Your financial and emotional support helped me through the toughest time of my life. I can't thank you enough.I've debated taking this page down, but have decided not to for now. The monthly co-pay on just my prescriptions alone is $1,500. Weekly trips to Philly, staying at the transplant house, and sometimes daily medical bills are not going away, so the page will remain. I'll keep you posted on my progress......Bill+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We have increased our goal due to the extension of our stay at the Mayo. Daryl had surgery number 1 this past Monday to remove the blood clots in his artery in his right leg. This clot is blocking blood flow to his foot which is causing serous issues. The surgery was completely unsuccessful as they were not able to remove the clots. The doctors now say the only way to try and get blood flow back is to do a bypass. However, he currently has no veins in good enough condition to do that yet. So, now we move on to surgery number 2 which we are anticipating will be sometime next week. This surgery will work on veins, but will also include the more serious issue of fixing a hole in the his heart, and also removing and replacing a permanent IVC filter. We have been here going on 3 weeks and will be here awhile longer. We are just like everyone else, living one check to another. We have a home with 3 of our children and our granddaughter at home and those expenses continue. We are just trying to make it possible to stay here as long as we need to stay to get Daryl the help he needs. We appreciate your help and are so thankful for everything that has been given so far. We are so blessed to have so many to help! Thank you! Daryl was diagnosed years ago with a blood clot disorder that has caused many complications over the last 13 years. He has been disabled and unable to work for many years due to the complications from his blood clots. Now we face some new complications that we have never faced before which have landed us at the Mayo Clinic. Daryl has 2 clots in his artery on the right leg and this has his blood flow blocked. His foot has now turned colors and he is down to 31% circulation and is in tremendous amounts of pain. He is facing amputations quickly if he can't get blood moving again. After going to multiple doctors at home and all of them saying they could not help him in Tennessee, we made the call to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. They immediately wanted to see him. We came straight down and they have been working non-stop the last week to find the best treatment for him. During evaluation they have found out they he has a hole in his heart and that allowed the 2 blood clots he has to lodge back into his artery instead of giving him a Stroke or going to his lung. Now, they have to close off the hole in his heart and then do the work on his artery to try and remove the clots. They also have to do some very major work on the venous side on his right leg and remove a filter that was places years ago to keep clots from going to his lungs. They will place a new filter above this one and the they will bust the old one out and suck it up. They will also do some work to try and help his ulcers heal. All of these things are risky and he could face amputation on the table, he could throw a clot, etc.. But, without the surgery his foot will continue to die and he will end up with amputation or Sepais. The surgery will take place later this week or Monday and will be in 3 parts with 3 separate surgeons. The doctors understand that he is ready to make this step so they are willing to try and give him some relief. He is absolutely miserable and needs relief. We believe God is in control and will give him his relief. This has been a emotional, scary, frustrating week, but we know we are exactly in the place God wants us to be. This trip was unexpected and we are already approaching a $1000.00 hotel bill since we arrived and will continue a bill each day. We also have to maintain our children and their expenses at home. We wish we could be in a position to not have to worry about expenses, but we are not. We expect to be here a while longer. If you want to help we would appreciate that so much. Thank you for your prayers, thoughts and calls. We love each of you and we are so blessed! Please do not feel obligated to give. This is just the easiest way for those who wanted to help us with this journey to be able to do so. Again, we are so blessed and so grateful for each of you!

Those of you that know them, know that they never ask anyone for help. Well, recently their (and our family's) lives have been turned upside down when they found out their 10 year old son Jaden has cancer. He has a large tumor that is taking up his nasal passage and back of his throat, making it diffucult for him to breathe. He is having surgery tomorrow at 1:00 pm in order to remove as much of the tumor as possible. He will need a tracheostomy in order to ensure he will continue to be able to breath freely, and he will need to start treatment after the surgery.The surgery and treatment are very expensive. While they have insurance, no one ever expects for something of this magnitude to happen. The insurance will only cover 80% of all of the medical bills, leaving thousands of dollars of debt. I am asking for donations to help cover the medical bills associated with Jaden's surgery and treatment. Please know that Kim and John, and the rest of our family, will be very greatful for any donation.Thank you, and please keep Jaden in your thoughts and prayers.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I always enjoyed our time.I thank God for you.""There has been such a tremendous outpooring of love and support from friends, family, coaches, teachers and perfect strangers; so much so, the King family cannot possibly thank each person individually but would like everyone to know just how much the support means to them. Gian will be laid to rest in the coming days and with that comes expenses for his burial, medical bills and various other expenses. If you are like many others that have reached out asking how to help and just aren't sure what you can do, we have in honor of Gian's giving spirit set up this GoFundMe account to help offset some of the King's expenses.If you feel that helping in this manner is the best way to pay your respects, any amount you can give is greatly appreciated and will be used in Gian's name.

The vehicle went off the road and traveled off the road for approx. 200 feet before being abruptly stopped by a tree. The brakes at no point were ever applied. The impact was immense ! The impact of the collision was such that the belt that was on the child opened up her abdomen area exposing her intestines. She also suffered severe head trauma. After undergoing surjury her head has been stiched up and they have managed to get things back in place in her abdomen region. She is currently on a respirator with a breathing tube.

Now we are faced with this disease up-close and on a personal level touching and impacting our lives. Some of us already know, our dear friend Rafael, a 39 year old father to an 11 year old boy, who has been recently diagnosed with this degenerative disease commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Rafael has taken this bull by the horns!!! He is in good spirits and facing this challenge head on. He was able to travel to Peru about a month ago to receive his first treatment. Unfortunately, this has hit him at a time of the year where he earns most of his yearly income due to the seasonal nature of his work. He continues to frequently miss work due to the progression of his condition. Currently he is following the Deanna protocol treatment, and takes numerous vitamins, supplements and is on an organic diet. He is trying any and all viable treatments out there to fight this disease. Unfortunately this comes at a cost, unable to work and get treatment, one can imagine the financial impact that he may be facing. We are looking for an apartment with ADA adaptations where he will be moving into so any recommendations are welcome. We are urging everyone to help Rafael in his fight by donating whatever you can afford. Every bit that we can give will help relieve Rafaels stress so that he can focus on treatment and maintain his quality of life the best way possible. No donation will be too small but a step closer to his victory against this disease. Together with Rafael, we will continue to beat this and ultimately overcome it . Thank you for your time, trust, FAITH and help. Please don't forget to consistently share this.Thank you again for the love given to our fighter, Rafael!Rafa's Friends and Family.                    + Read More"

Ashley made such a wonderful home for him, he didn't want to come out. Ashley was induced and labored for 30 hours. When it was time for Charlie to come out, he shut down and stopped breathing for about 2 - 3 minutes during birth. Charlie was born not breathing and blue. Ashley began hemorrhaging due to the speed that the doctors pulled baby Charlie out. Thankfully, Ashley is doing much better now after a blood transfusion and plenty of rest.Charlie is still having some trouble and is spending time in the NICU. Charlie has a swollen brain from these complications and is experiencing seizures quite often. His kidneys aren't functioning properly, he isn't digesting food the way he should, and Charlie is on machines to help him breathe. Charlie is a fighter though, and is desperately trying to get better and fight for his life.Charlie will be in the NICU for the forseeable future, and these parents may need some extra care when he is released. Hopsital bills between baby and mama are piling up, as you can imagine. All donations would go towards hospital bills and getting Charlie the absolute best care he needs and deserves.The Henderson's are a wonderful couple, trying to expand their family. We want baby Charlie to get the best care possible. Please consider donating anything to this incredible family. Any amount helps. Thank you so much in advance for your kindness.

Shes seven-and-a-half years old. Shes my brothers daughter.Ashlynn likes unicorns, dinosaurs and assorted other awesome things (Butter! Hot dogs! DRAGONS!) and is just generally one of the sweetest, gentlest, and most charming people I know. Even feral cats and random, curmudgeonly retail employees love this kid. She's irresistable. Dan, my brother, is not such a horrible guy, either (dont tell him I said that.) Hes a wonderful, doting, and patient father who works hard to provide and, despite some abysmally bad luck in life, doesnt like to ask for help. Which is why Im asking for him. Or, really, for Ash.For her entire life, Ashlynn has suffered from idiopathic seizures. Her doctors have tried various medications, but nothings really helped. They come on randomly and have caused significant hardship, affecting her ability to read, write, learn, and to enjoy the ordinary, carefree childhood she deserves.Recently, Ashlynns parents brought her to a new group of neurologists. Her new doctors found something previously (and heartbreakingly) overlooked on her earlier MRIs: Ashlynn has a brain tumor.Ashlynn has a BRAIN TUMOR. Shes had it for almost eight years. Yeah.The good news is that her doctors think the tumora slow-growing gliomais benign. However, it still needs to come out immediately, and even with insurance, her medical expenses for this surgery will be major. Shell be hospitalized for 7-10 days with a long recovery post-surgery. Worse, as Ashlynns parents are no longer together and her mother has her own health issues, Dan will have to take a 4-6 week unpaid leave of absence from his job in order to care for Ashlynn through her recovery.Although we hope that the ultimate outcome of this surgery will be positive and that it will allow Ash to put these seizures behind her, she and her family have a long, difficult road ahead of them and could really use the support of family and friends. If you are in the position to do so, please consider making a contribution to help cover Ashlynns medical bills and her day-to-day recovery expenses. I wish I could adequately convey both how hard it is to ask such a thing at a time when many people are struggling and just how gratefully appreciated your kindness will be should you chose to offer it, but I can't.

Aunque Santos lleg con todo el amor, el corazn, y el ahnco de vivir, su corazn fsico an no est completamente listo para ello.Santos padece de SCIH, que es el Sndrome del Corazn Izquierdo Hipoplsico. En los bebs que nacen con SCIH, el ventrculo izquierdo y la aorta son pequeos y al estar subdesarrollados, no pueden suministrar suficiente sangre al organismo.Hay dos maneras de tratar el SCIH: una es mediante un trasplante de corazn, y la otra es mediante una serie de operaciones, conjuntamente denominadas procedimiento de Norwood, que por lo general, es el procedimiento que se emplea con mayor frecuencia debido a la escasez de corazones donados para trasplante.Generalmente, el procedimiento de Norwood se realiza en tres etapas quirrgicas.1. La primera etapa debe realizarse al poco tiempo del nacimiento. La aorta se conecta directamente a la cavidad inferior derecha (el ventrculo derecho) para que pueda cerrarse el conducto arterial.2. La segunda etapa del procedimiento de Norwood (tambin denominada derivacin de Glenn bidireccional), generalmente se realiza cuando el beb tiene unos 6 meses de vida. La vena cava superior, que transporta la sangre pobre en oxgeno de la parte superior del cuerpo al corazn, se conecta a la arteria pulmonar, que lleva la sangre pobre en oxgeno a los pulmones; y,3. La tercera etapa del procedimiento de Norwood (tambin denominada procedimiento de Fontan), generalmente se realiza cuando el nio tiene entre 1 y 4 aos de edad. La vena cava inferior, que transporta la sangre pobre en oxgeno de la parte inferior del cuerpo al corazn, se conecta a la arteria pulmonar, que lleva esta sangre a los pulmones.**Texas Heart InstituteAfortunadamente Santos est recibiendo la mejor atencin mdica posible y fue todo un xito su primera intervencin quirrgica.

He is such a sweet and charming 10 year old little boy whose battle for his life began on September 6, 2016 when hislaughter was tragically stopped when he collapsed on the floor and had to be rushed to the hospital he wasunconscious with bleeding and swelling of the brain and was life flighted to Children's Hospital Pittsburgh, PA. The neurological staff at Children's Hospital, Pittsburgh took lifesaving measures to help Sawyer, beginning by placing an external ventricular drain to relieve his cranial pressure. On September 7, 2016 Sawyer went into surgery for a crainotomy to remove a portion of his skull to relieve the pressure and swelling. He is awaiting another brain surgery to remove the cluster of vessels but cannot do so until swelling comes down.Sawyer's family quickly learned that his bleed was caused by a AVM (arteriovenous malformation) which is a congenital birth defect. The AVM ruptured, causing a hemorrhage in the brain. The neurosurgeon explained that Sawyer was born with the AVM and it sat dormant, until now. Sawyer will spend the next several days on a ventilator and more than a month in the hospital being closely monitored and undergoing a number of procedures and tests.At this time he is in serious but stable condition and has a long journey ahead of him.The hope is that his body will absorb the clot on it's own, allowing the bleeding and swelling to subside. Until they feel it is safe, Sawyer will remain sedated and on life support in order to keep the pressure levels in his head down. (which currently are stabilizing).Sawyer is the son of Scott and Stacey (Shebeck) Gill, he has a younger sister (3years old) Seneca that wants her big brotherhome. Grandson to Fran and Sally Shebeck and nephew to Marcy and Nick VanSickles, Adam and Brittany Shebeck and cousins to Andrew, Brady and Addison. Unfortunately, the surgeon anticipates Sawyerwill be in the hospital for several months.  Since arriving at the hospital, Sawyer has had surgery and countless tests to diagnose and treat his condition. There will be much more in the future. Although it is the last thing on his family's mind, this will result in astronomically high hospital bills in the very near future, making everyday expenses difficult to manage. We would greatly appreciate any donations for Sawyer and his family to help alleviate some of the financial burden they will face during this horrific time. We are so grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

The LV muscle wall is very thin & the LV is very enlarged and her coronary sinus is very enlarged also. None of those are good at all. She several other congenital heart defects but those are the main ones. She also has sick sinus syndrome because of all of this. Causing her heart rate to go to 300 beats a min and suddenly drop to 40 beats a min. Neither of those are good.

To all you visitors, some of you I know well, some of you I know well, but we havent spoken in a while, some of you are acquaintances, some are aware that I exist, and finally, and hopefully many, have no idea who I am, but someone that does know me sent you to the page because they felt I was a moderately decent human being. Thanks to all for visiting.Why are you here?With the help of friends, I have set up this page because I need your help. I have cancer, and I need significant financial help to cover medical and life expenses. Why, because that pesky cancer is expensive, and to continue my next steps in treatment and recovery, I will not be able to do it without your support.Who is Rick Holt?I am a 50 year old, single father of two great kids, a daughter-19, and a son-18 (Yes they are only 12  months apart. Boy was a surprise.). They are great kids, and my greatest accomplishment. I live in Frisco, TX, a suburb of Dallas. I am a partner in a marketing consulting firm that I started back in 2004. I am very outgoing, very sarcastic and can be mildly entertaining. People that know me would likely say that I am a good guy. At least I try to be. I am very much an optimist, a glass half full guy. It is the reason I am still walking among you. I have never been scared about my cancer, but have seen it as nothing more than an annoyance. Attitude is everything.What cancer do I have?I have Stage IVA Thymic Cancer, B2/B3 Thymoma. You ask - what the heck is that? Well it has to with your Thymus Gland, and it is the rarest cancer in the world. My attitude was if you are going to get cancer, go big or go home and get the most rare. Why get boring lung or colon cancer? There are only 250 - 400 cases in the world a year. I was diagnosed in September 2008 and have been battling it since. The good part of my cancer is that it is slow growing, so it does not overwhelm patients quickly. The bad part is by being so rare, treatment options are limited and in a lot of cases, shots in the dark. What have I been doing to fight it?Over the last almost 8 years, it has been a combination of surgeries, chemo and multiple clinical trials. I will give more details in updates and future videos I am going to post, all under the theme Tales from Cancer Camp. (I have cancer; you have got to have fun with it.) I have lost my hair three times and been bald, which is by far the worst thing that has happened. What is my current status?Until last June I have been ahead in the fight, feeling really good, keeping it at bay as best as possible. My doctors used to say you are the healthiest cancer patient we have. During the first 7 years, I was never sick. I only had to deal with side effects from the various drugs. Unfortunately, starting last June, my body began not cooperating in a manner to which I am accustomed; I am now in the unenviable position of being behind my cancer. For the past 13 months, I have had a fever every single day. In July of 2015, I was in the hospital twice for a total of 17 days because my immune system crashed. During that time they drowned me in antibiotics, which resulted in my taste buds being rendered useless. I now have not tasted food in a year (This REALLY sucks.). Plus my stomach shrunk. The result, I have lost 45 pounds in the past year. I have gone from being fit and dead sexy, to a walking skeleton (photos to come.). Plus, I literally just got out of the hospital on July 24 after a week because I got pneumonia. So not a banner year, but do know my demise is far from imminent.What are my next steps?I am in the process of identifying the next steps in treatment. It will include a combination of potential clinical trials and alternative therapies. All the current options will be expensive; hence the reason for this page. Of the clinical trials I am investigating, one is in San Diego and one in Israel. Other than any trial medications, all costs: travel, medical expenses, follow up care, are all born by me, which can easily add up to tens of thousands of dollars.The alternative therapy that I am going to undertake is called Gerson Therapy. It is a natural approach that focuses on detoxification and strengthening of the immune systems through nutrition via juicing, coffee enemas, and other elements. This therapy has shown to have a positive effect on a number of cancers, but it is an investment. Just in year one, the therapy will cost approximately $55,000. That includes a $16,000 charge to visit the wellness center for one month where they teach you the methods. It is $2,500 for the juicer/press necessary to create the 14 juices a day. Finally, the produce to generate the juices alone is up to $3,000 per month.Why the GoFundMe page? As I have said, cancer aint cheap. In addition to the costs I mentioned around the treatments, I have my normal medical expenses of $35,000 - $50,000 per year that include premiums, deductibles, copays, medicines, travel, and the list goes on. There is also lost income from the impact on my ability to work at times.The reality is this disease has bankrupted me. To add insult to injury, I decided to first be diagnosed at the exact same moment our economy went into the worst recession since the Great Depression (would love a do over on that one.). And my health and business have never fully recovered.So I simply need your help to continue my treatments, pay for medical expenses, (current and past due), and help with everyday/life expenses, especially as my health has waned in the past year. What is my goal?So everyone please be seated, I do not want anyone to faint or fall down from laughing. My minimum goal is $250,000. That would allow me to effectively cover my medical expenses over the next two years, and as I mentioned even help with everyday expenses/bills. Do not worry, I am not off to Bora Bora, nor will I run off to Vegas. All the money will go to helping cover the expenses of life and will help me get healthy and keep me a roof over my head.Now as I am goal oriented, I would like to be able to raise much more. The best thing that could happen for my health would be the ability to take a year off of work and focus on trying to get healthy without the stress of working and running a business. Again a significant investment, but I believe it could truly help me be back in front of my cancer versus being behind it.What do I need from you?First, thank you for at least reading a little about me. My ask is simple; if possible, you make a donation to my fund and know that it will truly be appreciated. Whatever you feel is right or can afford. Even $10 is more than I had yesterday. Every dollar helps me to reduce my financial burden.Secondly, I am asking everyone to share my story with everyone they know: social networks, churches, bible studies, neighbors, friends and co-workers. I truly would love to see my call for help reach as many as possible. Heck if Chewbacca mom can become famous and have millions of views and hits, I hope I have a slightly better reason for people to take notice. Imagine if we just got 250,000 people or more to donate $10. The more people the better. Why donate to my fund?Well I am kind of awesome, good conversationalist, kind of humorous and not a murderer. All good qualities I think.In reality, I am no better than anyone else on this site, nor is my story truly unique. If you find another person to help whose story seems more compelling, please help them. I believe that I am a normal guy, who truly tries to be a good person. My children are my joy and I want to be with them for a long time. I will put my mental fortitude and optimism against anyones, so you know that I will not ever give up this fight. My attitude has kept me alive when the statistics say I should be dead. The most powerful statement I have heard from my dozens of doctors was from my local oncologist when I was first diagnosed. He said that he can tell in the first 30 seconds if a patient will live or die based solely on their attitude. Those that freak out because they have the C word go and they go quick. Those that maintain a positive attitude and fight have better outcomes all around.While I am not the best cancer patient, sometimes forgetting I even have the disease and really not worrying about it, somehow my friends and others have found my fight and my optimism inspirational. I think, of course, this is what you do, fight it in any way you can, no big deal, but I guess some find it extraordinary in how I approach it. For those, thank you for believing in me. What will you get from donating to my fund?Well my promise to you is that you money will be used responsibly and for me being able to get healthy and cover the expenses of life. I also promise you that through updates and videos I will post on this site, I will try and entertain you and give you the chance to better know the person you are helping. Hopefully you will not regret making a donation.That is it for now; more to come in much more entertaining videos. So be on the lookout for the next chapter from Tales from Cancer Camp.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Doctors later discovered that Mark had a seizure while driving, which was caused by a mass discovered in his brain. A biopsy the following Thursday confirmed the worst: the mass is cancerous. In addition to recuperating from injuries caused by the accident, Mark and his family are now facing an uncertain future as he battles cancer.Mark and his wife, Melanie, have both been educators throughout Indiana at Portage High School, Lewis Cass Jr./Sr. High and Logansport Community School Corporation. Additionally, Mark is a member of the Geek Squad at Best Buy in Kokomo. Their daughters, Maddy and Mari Karmel are both exceptional athletes and students at Lewis Cass in their senior and junior years, respectively. Mari is a member of the Marching Kings and Maddy is a manager for the varsity baseball team. The Karmels are also members of the All Saints Catholic Parish in Logansport.So heres where you come in:Mark and his family are, of course, doing all they can to arrange for the best treatment for him as soon as possible. The Karmels have a long road ahead of them, both in accident trauma recovery, as well as pursuing a treatment plan doctors believe is best for fighting brain cancer. I, the next door neighbors daughter who has grown up with a second family, thanks to the Karmels, ask that you donate what you can to support them financially, as well as pray for both Mark and his family.Anything you can give is greatly appreciated by Mark and his family. The food donations and well-wishes have been so helpful and valued, but any assistance helping the family tackle a huge financial responsibility would be incredible.Thank you so much for the prayers and positive vibes.

On Christmas week of 2012, just over a month after attending the Celebration of Life for one of my best friends who tragically did not survive his encounter with tongue cancer, I was diagnosed with Advanced Prostate Cancer at the early age of 36. This was after my mother was already diagnosed with Advanced Breast Cancer and in early 2014 was persuaded by her oncologist into a chemotherapy regimine that her body was not able to handle, that unfortunatly took her life later that year. To add more insult to cancer injury, at the same time my mom was being pumped with chemo my sister was also diagnosed with breast cancer which was quickly followed by her having to go through extensive surgery. So needless to say ""The Big C"" has pretty much been my life for the past few years and has regretfully kept me from what I love most - music (not that I didn't try to keep on rockin' for the first year or so there).When they discovered my cancer it was already Stage IV and had spread out from my prostate and into my bones. I visited numerous urologists and oncologists at some of the top cancer centers in the country, but they all told me there was no cure for my condition. With each visit I hoped the next place would have the newest, latest, greatest miracle treatment but none of them did. They all offered me hormone therapy, which involved either a $3000 shot I had to take every few months that would slowly destroy my testicles or full-on castration (yes, they told me that with a straight face), but also made sure I understood it was not a cure and at best would only buy me anywhere from a few months to a couple years before the cancer would adapt and return stronger than ever. In my initial dazed and confused state, they were able to scare me into getting jabbed by one of those babies and I quickly realized that a man in his 30's is not meant to be without testosterone. Let's just say the side effects were way worse for me than the cancer itself so I abandoned that idea and decided there had to be another way.I looked into diet as well as detoxing and supplements and made significant changes to the way I was living. Before long I found I had completely turned my less-than-healthy musician lifestyle around and felt better than ever (dispite various bone pains from the metastasis). I even found myself doing yoga - and liking it! My new lifestyle seemed to do wonders in slowing down my aggressive Gleason Score 8 cancer (they say prostate cancer in younger men spreads much more rapidly than those who get it later in life) but it was not enough. The scans showed that more spots were slowly appearing around my bones, including my spine, shoulder blades and pelvis, and when nodules started forming on my lungs I knew it was time to stop messing around. I did more research and found a cancer clinic in Mexico that not only supported and encouraged my new healthy habits, but also offered numerous other treatments from other countries that are non-toxic and have been shown to destroy cancer cells. I began a viral-therapy, and in 3 months the results were amazing. The tumors on my prostate had shrunk so much that the volume of my prostate was reduced by 24%. More importantly, Color Doppler Ultrasound showed that the blood vessels that had grown to feed the tumors had reduced by 80%! This was a month ago, so of course I'm continuing that treatment and have thrown another one in the mix for good measure. Trips to the clinic are such a positive experience as well. The doctors all truly care and do not look at me like I am a lost cause (a look I know all too well) and the other patients are truly inspiring. With every visit I meet more and more strong people, many with conditions way worse than mine, that are reversing their cancer and are living happy, healthy lives. The only downside is that the treatments and trips to Mexico are indeed expensive and unfortunately and not surprisingly they don't take Obamacare! That is where I need your help. My career choice as a musician has regretfully not left me filthy rich and unfortunately my ability to work has dwindled over the past year or so, thus the need for said crowd-funding project! I hate begging for money (especially knowing that most of my friends are not-so-filthy rich musicians themselves), but anything you can donate to the cause would go a long way to ensuring I am able to keep up my treatments and continue to see doctors that spread the feeling of hope - which is way more important to overcoming a cancer diagnosis than most may realize! On a side note, while it is true that when I was first diagnosed I was scared s**tless, I have now accepted that there is truly no reason to fear. I have realized that cancer is not an outside invader but part of my body made of my own cells, and instead of declaring war I have decided to embrace it and live as long as I can while coaxing my body to want to return to a healthier state. Regardless of how long I am able to keep on kickin' it with my mutated cell friends, it puts me at ease to be able to say that I am truly happy. I have been blessed to be able to make a living (yes, I call it that!) doing what I love, and I am truly grateful to have been able to travel to all the places I've been and for all the amazing people I have met along the way. If this were the end of the road I can honestly say that it has been a wonderful ride, but with your help to continue my treatments I'm pretty confident that I'll be on the road again before you know it!Thank you in advance for your help. God bless!Justin aka ""Scotty""P.S. As for my sister, I'm happy to say her last PET scan came back completely clean, she is in the best shape of her entire life, and may I add has been the greatest caregiver a big brother could ever ask for.

This is now a high risk pregnancy turned emergency situation. If she goes into labor before she is 34 weeks (11/15) baby Eden will have to stay in the nicu at least until her due date on 12/23. In which case, she will be staying here in Austin a long with her. If they are able to keep her pregnant until she is 34 weeks (11/15) baby Eden will have to stay in the NICU at least 2-3 weeks (11/25-12/2). So with either outcome we are here for the long haul. The doctor's number one goal right now is to keep Courtnee infection free, and to keep Eden in her belly until 34 weeks to give her the easiest and best chance. At this time there is no way for her to be transferred back to Dallas. So she will be hospitalized and treated here in Austin until Eden can come home.A lot of people have asked what we need right now, and it's honestly been a tricky question to answer because we aren't really sure how things will progress.Currently, our biggest needs are prayer, and financial support. The hardest part about this whole thing is the fact that our children and myjob are all in Dallas. Although Iwant to be there with Courtnee (and I am eligible to take the time off from work to be with her the entire time via my FMLA), it would be an unpaid leave--- which we obviously can't afford because we still have living expenses, on top of new expenses, kids, ""life"" etc. It is very hard to process me not being there if an emergency situation happens because he is 3+ hours away at work. Any support to be able help withflexibility is greatly needed. Iwill be traveling back and forth to Dallas to work and transport the kids to visit Courtnee unless a miracle happens where we can afford for me to be away from work for an extended period.Any financial gifts we receive will be used to cover:- Support to cover my unpaid leave from work via FMLA. Which gives me up to 12 weeks, of unpaid leave to come and be with Courtnee in Austin until baby Eden arrives.(I am the sole income for our family. Without your support, I'm unable to be in Austin with Courtnee during the week.)-Travel to and from Dallas for work, and to transport the kids to Austin weekly to visit Courtnee.- Money for food while in Austin.- To cover monthly expenses so that I will be flexible to spend more time supporting Courtnee in Austin.- Medical expenses that we are daily incurring.- Small purchases for Courtnee and I during our stay. Such as; toiletry items, etc. and others things we did not pack for an extended stay.-Hotel stays for the kid's visits.- Hotel stays for after Eden arrives, and is placed in the NICU.- Support for our family who are in Dallas daily caring for our two children.Our family and friends have been incredible with supporting us, and keeping us in a positive mindset during this time. We are sooooo THANKFUL for all of your prayers, and gifts, and phone calls! Your support is everything to us right now. We need you guys. So thank you so much!!I hope this has been helpful. We want to keep you guys in the know as much as possible! Please continue to pray for us, as we navigate this crazy time.

It can rip your world apart! It strips you of your Faith! CANCER! It takes away your freedom, your life, your home, your income, and everything you can think of. In the Fall of 2015, Candias moved to Memphis, TN, in hopes to start a better life for her and her five year old son Cayden. Candias started a new job, and enrolled her son into school. After getting settled in, she began to take ill. Candias went to several doctors appointments,and was tested for several things. With the unknown of what was occurring with her body, Candias positive attitude never changed! When the test results returned, it was determined that Candias had a diagnosis of Stage 2 Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma Cancer. It is a type of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma that affects the B-Cells. This form of cancer can go into remission after treatments of Chemotherapy. Candias was forced to quit her job to focus on her health. As of today, Candias is receiving Chemo, and is fighting this battle. We never know when and how we would be placed in certain situations. If you find the kindness in your heart, a monetary donation would be greatly appreciated to assist with her medical needs. We are asking that you keep Candias in your prayers.

Please help fund the transplant!Isaiah 40:31 but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.Meet Mary Morgan, beautiful wife of Bill for 20 years, mom to sweet teenaged girls, Mackenzie (14) and Macy (13), and a friend and servant to a countless many. Mary needs a kidney transplant due to renal failure from polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A live donor has graciously offered her one of his kidneys, so all that stands between Mary and LIFE is the transplant!Her story:Mary was diagnosed while she was a student at the University of Georgia when she was just 20 years old. Her grandfather, father and brothers have, or had, this hereditary disease so it was not a complete shock to her. If you know Mary, then you know she is a fighter! She swam competitively as a child and continued to focus on her health while running and spinning until her body just wouldnt keep the pace anymore. She is now on dialysis until the transplant can save her life.PKD is more common than sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, Downs syndrome, and Huntingtons disease combined. With this said, treatment has come a long way lately. Mary has taken such great care of her body with appropriate exercise and diet for so many years that she was able to qualify for peritoneal dialysis. She literally plugs herself into a dialysis machine while she sleeps at night at home. This is the best case scenario for this mother of active teens.Like her father and brothers, Marys successful transplant will reverse most of her symptoms including very low energy levels, persistent nausea, leg cramps that prevent her from sleeping, anemia, UTIs, kidney stones, and high blood pressure, just to name a few. Mary desperately wants to regain strength so that she can be the mother she desires to be! Mary has been a faithful member of First Baptist Church of Orlando for over 10 yrs. and wants to return too leading Bible Studies, and serving her church. Without a transplant at this phase of her disease, Marys life expectancy is only 5 - 10 years with daily dialysis.So, Mary is blessed with health insurance but it does not cover all the expenses transplant incurs. The costs are high and she would greatly appreciate help covering the $10,000 deductible and co-pays. This will fund her through pre-transplant and transplant. (Post transplant anti-rejection meds are another story!)No donation is too small; any donation amount is greatly appreciated! Many kind and generous people have offered to help Mary throughout the years. She is eternally grateful for each and every one of you! Please help Mary renew her strength and soar! Please donate now.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Dean, a devoted man to his family and especially his grandchildren has an urgent need for your help.A day not so long ago this year, James was working as a chef and thought there was smoke in the kitchen and something was burning. His staff reassured him there was nothing burning and there wasn't smoke in the kitchen. So, he made an appointment to go to an opthalmologist to get his eyes checked.The opthalmologist said his eyes were normal, with the exception of higher pressure than normal so he suggested a chest x-ray. At his follow-up visit, the doctor said his heart was fine but suggested a visit to his pulmonologist to check his lungs.He went to visit his pulmonologist and concluded that there was a 2cm - 3cm mass in his lung. Other tests confirmed it was stage 1 lung cancer. He was scheduled for a lobectomy to remove the tumor 6 weeks later. During the operation, the surgeon found that the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, chest wall, and diaphragm. The surgery was aborted at that time. When James woke up from his surgery, he was waiting for the news that the tumor was removed and he would be monitored for a period of time without chemo or other treatments. But, the news he received wasn't what he was expecting. He was now diagnosed as Stage 4 lung cancer and needed to start Chemo immediately.Unfortunately, he is unable to continue his chef position and has been terminated from his job. James is no longer able to work or receive a pay check. His medical bills are mounting and he is trying not to go into foreclosure with his house or have his electricity & water turned off.He desperately needs your funding to help keep his house and pay his medical bills and other expenses so that his family and granchildren can visit and be with him in a place they call home.James is my brother. We have lost our grandfather, mother, and half sister to this ugly disease already. Our father and older brother were diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Our father has since passed because of other health issues and to this day our older brother is in remission. I can only ask that your generaosity and kind heart help with his fund.

Please Help Pat and Karl !!!,"$56,661 ","$75,000 ",Medical," August 30, 2016",338,26,SAN FRANCISCO,CA,644000,2,5,"                            Joan Haratani                                                                                        on behalf of Rogan KriedtSAN FRANCISCO, CA                                                        Pat Morrison, Pacific School elementary school teacher and gardener extraordinaire, Karl Kriedt, carpenter, builder, sailor, General Contractor par excellence and all around great guy, and their only child, Rogan, have been an incredibly blessed and happy family. Karl and Pat designed and built their home together in the Santa Cruz mountains while living on the property in an Airstream trailer for almost ten years.Living in Bonny Doon at the top of a crest, working in Davenport or the Cruz, going to school at PCS and then Stanford, life has been one wonderful occurrence after another. And they shared their good fortune. They have each done more than their part of contributing to the community, whether it be through teaching our young, helping out those in need, or simply killing it in school (read, Rogan). But Lady Fortune is a wheel, and now that wheel, which has favored them for 25 years, has taken a turn, and their fortune has been severely and sadly impacted.I am writing to you with the hope and prayer that you will help this family in need.In what can only be described as a Greek tragedy, Pat has recently suffered a recurrence of her breast cancer. After ten years of follow ups, treatments, careful and clean/healthy living, her breast cancer has metastasized to her spinal fluid and has launched all over her body. She sadly retired from teaching at the Pacific School, where she taught for nearly 20 years.  The doctors, in a desperate attempt to save her life, placed a port in her brain three months ago so that they could deliver chemotherapy to her spinal fluid, but that resulted in more harm than good. She is now under the care of hospice.At the same time, Karl, who has never smoked a day in his life, was diagnosed with tongue cancer in November. After losing one third of his tongue in December, a month ago he went in for a minor medical visit. After 10 hours of surgery and a week long stay in the hospital, he is now home, mending, but with no tongue and no larynx. He starts radiation in two weeks and looks forward to the day when he can eat soft foods. Karl has been working as much as he could before the surgery, even driving over the hill for work, while trying to recuperate from his past operation. Now, he needs to focus on getting stronger and transitioning to his new life. He cant work for a while, so the family income stream is severely impacted. You can only imagine the hell he has been going through and the hell he has been living.All the while, Pat cannot move her legs, has no balance, and certainly no strength to sit up in bed, let alone walk down the hall. She needs 24 hour care. Period. Rogan has been helping out as much as possible, even taking most of the night time shifts to help his mom out. But he is a 25 year old young man and needs to make sure that he doesnt jeopardize his health or his career.But care and caregivers are super expensive. Through no fault of their own, they simply, like many of us, do not have the resources to pay the $ 300/day plus needed for care for Pat, let alone any help for Karl. And Karl needs to ability and time to heal completely. The thought of him losing his wife  the mother of his only child  only to have to make that drive over the hill and back every day to keep the lights on, is too much.Thats why I have set up this go fund me.Our financial goals are modest. First and foremost, we would like to cover the costs of 24 hour caregivers and possibly some meal deliveries, etc. The fact that the family is all the way out in Bonny Doon makes finding qualified caregivers even more challenging. If we could build a bit of a cash stash for the family, they could hire good, consistent and reliable help, and gain peace of mind so they can focus on the emotional aspect of their lives without wondering where the money is next coming from. If Pat lives for another month, which she easily could (lets hope!) we would need $9,000 for caregivers alone.Second, we also want to build a nest egg for Karl, so that he has the ability to rest and recuperate from his double whammy. If we could raise $30k for Karl, that will more than take him through a year, which is what he is going to need in order to recover from losing Pat, and from his own two surgeries.Wont you please contribute to their peace of mind by giving a modest gift of ten, twenty, fifty dollars? Larger gifts are of course welcome!!! Even though the goal stated for this campaign is $ 25,000, my real goal is $50,000.00. That would give them enough money for caregivers and for Karls health and well being.Many thanks for reading this, and please forward this to any kind hearted soul. Your gift makes the difference between a more comfortable end of life experience, versus a life in the type of hell that Greek tragedies are so famous for.Thank you for reading this, and bless you! Please pass it on and pay it forward.With much love and appreciation,Joan                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

About a month after that she was disgnosed with a rare condition called GATA2. Without going into many details it basically means that her body is unable to protect her from infection. Her immune system is extremely comprimised. She needs a bone marrow transpolant as soon as safely possible. She has a bone marrow match in her sister Gail Hawkins. Gail has graciously given her stem cells for my mother. This was not an easy thing to do. she was put out of work for a few days and she had to stay in the Lebanon area for three days. We are eternally grateful for her sacrifice, without her, my mom would have had no match. My parents have depleted their savings because my mom has had to travel to DHMC several times a month since October in preparation for the transplant. She has had to undergo several tests and procedures to get ready for this. She was forced into early retirement because she ran out of sick time and she was working in a nursing home. Her immune sysytem could not keep up with the germs that go around in there. My mom is currently paying out of pocket for her health insurance monthly at $790 per month. She has not been approved for SSDI as of yet.she has a pension that is about $860 per month, but that is what she uses to pay for her health insurance. She still has to pay out of pocket for all of her co-pays and deductibles. my mom is actually recieving her bone marrow transplant on Friday July 15th. She has to spend a month at DHMC and she is currently there now. My father has to work (he has no sick time to use) and with him being the only person making any money in the household he cannot afford to be out of work. This money will help him with the cost of being with her on his days off, and hopefull be enough money to help her when she gets home. She willhave to travelback and forth to DHMC weekly for about 6 months and she may have to do this more than one time per week. She will also have to go to Lancaster (DHMC satalite center) for blood transfusions and fluids as needed to keep her healthy.The recovery time for this is usually 2 years. She has a long road ahead of her and we have already hit a few bumps in the road including a possible blood infection called Strep Varidans (being treated with Vancomycin and cephtriaxone(antibiotics)). She has been experiencing headaches and chest pain that showed some changes in her EKG (MD's think her heart is under stress). She has been recieving Chemo 12 hours a day since her admission. She is a trooper and has a love in her heart for everyone! She is a very loved lady by her family and friends. being able to help my parents with this money will mean the world to them and me! They need this help, and they would never ask anyone for help. My mom has a chance for a new life, to feel better and be able to enjoy her children, grandchildren and her great grandchildren! She has worked since she was 16 years old, now its time for her. She is the most amazing person! With your donation we may be able to take one more burden off her shoulders!

Her mother Lori found out that Lindsey has a Glioma Tumor on her brain. We do not know the extent of it yet but they just had to travel from West Virginia to St. Jude Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. This is the first update from Lori:I'm going to do my very best to give an update everyday. I can't tell you how much we appreciate all the prayers, love and support. Please just keep it coming. My sweet baby girl has a very long road ahead of her. We are going to be here a very long time. As of right now that's about all we know. We did meet her team of Dr's which are amazing. This afternoon they will be reviewing her CT and MRI scan taken from Princeton Community Hospital. Early in the morning Linds will have more scans and test. We will meet with her Dr's around 1 tomorrow. At that time we should know exactly what we are dealing with. Please Please Please just continue to pray for Gods Healing Touch! Anyone who knows Linds at all knows she is a very strong young lady. Obviously she is scared but we have put all our Faith in God. There is not a doubt in my mind that God has big plans for Lindsey. God Is Good All The Time And All The Time God Is Good!There will be many expenses for their family including travel back and forth from Tennessee to West Virginia, food, Bills back home will keep coming, and the Medical Bills will be ongoing. Any donation is greatly appreciated and All Prayers are Welcome. Thank you from the bottom of our Hearts. This campaign may be under my name, Michele Strickland as I amthe one who set it up.

As many know that Landon's older Brother, Logan came early with plenty of scares to this young family. Theyhave associated costs like Ronald McDonald House fees or hotel cost when the Ronald McDonald House is full, medical bills that are not covered by insurance, fuel costs, as well as misc. bills with Becky out of work for 8 weeks (which wasn't planned yet). To top it off, still keep up Logans normal schedule. If you know or ask anyone who knows these two, they would lend a hand if someone asked. Anything that can be donated isgreatly appreciated. This family has gone through great lengths to help us when we were displaced by flooding and when we needed a sitter last minute, so we want to help them. Thank you!

Two strikes but Leandro's not out!,"$38,040 ","$50,000 ",Medical," April 25, 2016",338,5,RIVER EDGE,NJ,1500,7,17,"                            Ilene Anesini                                                                                        on behalf of Leandro TaverasRIVER EDGE, NJ                                                        Two strikes with cancer but Leandros not out!In December 2004, the Taveras family, father Jorge, mother Katherine, son Leandro, and daughter Sofia, had their holiday season cut short when they learned that their 8 year old son had been diagnosed with leukemia (a form of blood cancer). Over the course of the next two and a half years, Leandro endured multiple rounds of chemotherapy, thousands of pills, and weeks of radiation before ultimately emerging on the other side, cancer free. With the support of their town, school and surrounding communities, the Taveras family was able to make it through this trying time.A decade later, tragedy struck again. Katherine, declared perfectly healthy at her annual well visit just six months prior, was diagnosed with Stage III Pancreatic cancer. Meetings with doctors in the area yielded unhappy results, discussion centered around palliative and hospice care. Eight months of chemotherapy, over thirty rounds of radiation, and two complex surgeries later, Katherine is poised to beat the 3% five-year survival rate she was quoted prior to beginning treatment.5 years is a memorable milestone for most cancer patients; it marks the official beginning of a cancer free life. Yet the Taverass familys work is still not done.Just three months into his first co-op/internship and halfway through his second year at Northeastern University in Boston, Leandro experienced symptoms that prompted blood tests confirming the worst, his leukemia has relapsed after more than a decade in remission. From finding a newfound passion for baking (his banana bread is said to be legendary), to juggling in the quad, to exploring all that the city of Boston had to offer, it was difficult for Leandro to leave a job that he loved and a school that loved him. However, its going to take a lot more than cancer to keep Leandro out for long. He is eager for a smooth recovery and is incredibly hopeful that hell be able to resume college life and make it back in time for classes in the fall. This isthe game plan:Leandro is currently undergoing four to six weeks of intense chemotherapy and radiation in order to prepare his body for a bone marrow transplant, which offers him the best chance at long-term survival. Similar to blood, bone marrow has types, and the Taveras family (with a simple cheek swab) has been fortunate enough to learn that Sofia is a perfect match for Leandro, saving them from the complicated process of going through the global bone marrow registry to findan unrelated donor. Upon successful completion of chemo, the plan is for Leandro to undergo a bone marrow transplant in early June. He will need about three months to fully recover from the operation, which will include four weeks of isolation in the hospital.Sofia is set to start her college journey at Gettysburg College in the fall (and yes, shell be playing on the basketball team!). While Katherine is still concentrating on her medical recovery, husband and father Jorge continues to support the family as best as he can.My name is Ilene Anesini, and my son and Leandro have been best friends since first grade. My family and I have been with the Taveras since that difficult day in 2004 when Katherine first called to say that Leandro had been diagnosed with leukemia. We have witnessed first hand the financial and emotional struggle that cancer has had on a family that we love and care about. And now, as Leandro faces another battle for his life, the Taveras need our help more than ever.Please join me in an effort to end Leandros leukemia once and for all. Every contribution you can make to help defray Leandros substantial medical costs is more than appreciated and will allow his family to better focus on him and each other.

I'm writing this with a very heavy heart.My father has just been diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his vertebrae, and has spread to other places we don't know of just yet. We just moved to Houston six weeks ago from Las Vegas. Everything was going great (my parents were in the midst of a house in escrow, and my sister and I were getting along great with our new friends). However, there was one problem. My father had pain in his lower back region, which he had initially self-diagnosed as muscle pain from moving boxes. As time went on it got progressively worse to the point where he was almost in tears just walking around the apartment. Since we just moved to Houston, our insurance for my dad's job still hasn't kicked in so my parents had to pay 5,000 for COBRA. The insurance from the work isn't a guarantee because he won't be working for a long time.My dad is one of the strongest people I know, working even the day he was admitted into the hospital. He's worked jobs he hates just so that we can live happily, sat around a swim center for hours on end and never complained, and always makes sure everyone has a smile on their face (he's quite the jokester). Even now, when he's going through the worst possible pain, he still makes jokes to the nurses and tries to make his family laugh.Medical bills can get extremely expensive, and I already see my parents struggling to pay for this even though it's just the beginning. This money will be used for my dad's treatments and for his overall wellbeing (medications, therapy).I would love to see my dad/pappa at both my sisters and my graduation. I would love to see my parents grow old together. My sister and I need a dad. This would mean so much to me because it would mean a second chance for my dad.My family and I would like to thank anyone who took the time to read this and make a donation. Every small donation or prayer means everything to us right now.               -The Juschka Family-                                            + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

For those of you who are unfamiliar, it is a rather uncommon neuromuscular disability that over time causes atrophy of the entire muscular system. SMA might be my diagnosis, but I have never let it define who I am. I am a lover of travel and music, and I love to make friends and meet new people. During my young life, I have been able to do all of these things in large part due to my handicap accessible van (because you and I both know that calling a cab with a 200+ pound wheelchair isnt an option.)Thanks to this van (and my amazing friends and family), I have been able to see many beautiful places around the country over the past several years. From Florida beaches to the Red Rock amphitheater in Colorado, I am slowly but surely experiencing everything the United States has to offer, and I am eager to see more and more of it every day. However, with adventure comes a price, and unfortunately my van has quickly gone from accessible to you probably shouldnt drive this anymore.With 150,000 miles, my 2005 Dodge Caravan has extensive rust damage beyond repair, and it needs to be replaced as soon as possible. I have spent the last few years in and out of the mechanic dumping thousands into her to milk every mile possible out of it and unfortunately, my little blue beast's time has come to an end. Neither insurance nor the state will help fund an accessible vehicle, and I am in desperate need of your help to get back on the road again.I am reaching out to you today for financial and/or social support. A few dollars can really go a long way, and spreading the word on social media helps too. I am currently finishing up my senior year at the University of Illinois, and hope to be in grad school next fall working on my Masters of Public Policy. With your help, I will be able to fund a used van that can not only get me to wherever I end up for grad school, but also continue to help me write my store and share the experiences and adventures of my life with all of you.To anyone who has ever been along for an adventure in the van, you know how much it means to me, and you can attest to my attachment to the one thing that grants me the ability to explore. If it was an option to fly, I would do it in a heartbeat, but somehow flying with a wheelchair is still not an option. My van acts as much more than just a set of wheels, it is the key that unlocks my ability to travel, explore and see the world.After extensive research, I have chosen a replacement vehicle: A 2012 Dodge Caravan. If you want more information on the vehicle I have chosen to replace the blue beast, get in contact with me and I can show you!Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you can spread some joy in some else's life today!Any contribution, financial or otherwise, means more to me than you could imagine.

It may not mean much to anyone else, but to me and my brother, it's the day that we were given the devastating news of the true nature our father's health. He was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 4, to be exact. This news has torn my family apart, but through the darkness we've tried to gather the hope we have left for his recovery.I look back at how things quickly transpired in a matter of a month. My father went to see his doctor because he was complaining about pain from his underarm area. Upon thorough testing and a biopsy, they were able to see the multiple tumors that are rapidly spreading throughout his body. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, kidneys and now parts of his brain. He is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Our prayers and faith in God are high, we are hopeful that he will fight this ugly disease. My dad will be 68 in January and before his diagnosis he was full of life. His jovial and jolly demeanor had anyone he encountered in happy spirits. Anyone that knew him would be more than excited to tell you a happy story about him. My father is still 16 years old at heart, always smiling, and always giving his last dollar to make sure you were comfortable, even if he wasn't. He is selfless and so giving to everyone.Now with this disease taking over the majority of his body, he has been forced to stop working to take care of his health. Although the time off is needed, his bills are still piling up and beyond his reach. He is now consumed by worry and fear at being unable to make ends meet, when he should be focused on fighting this uphill battle. Due to his weakness from chemotherapy, he is in need of a 24 hour home attendant. Unfortunately, his insurance will not pay for it. My family and I are asking for any donations that can help offset the costs of his expensive medical treatments, transportation to and from the hospital, his payments to his monthly mortgage and all other expenses that he can no longer afford. There is no amount that is too small; your contribution would be greatly appreciated!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

The tumor, about 7 inches by 4.3 inches (18 cm x 11 cm), is pressing on his lungs and heart, making it difficult to breathe. It appears not to be cancerous, but continues to grow and requires immediate surgery. Like most Mexicans, the Esparzas dont have the kind of medical insurance needed to cover the costs of the surgery, hospital stay, and other related needs, which the family has to pay at the time of treatment. The estimated cost is about US $15,000.Given the need for Aaron to have surgery as soon as possible, we as a school community think the fastest way to raise the needed funds is through GoFundMe. If you are able to help, regardless of the amount, we respectfully ask you to make your donation sooner rather than later, so we can get the funds to the Esparza family without delay. (Alternatively, if you are in Puebla and would prefer to make a cash donation at the school, we will forward that to the family.) The Esparza familyare treasured members of the Puebla Christian School community; Aaron is a top student in his class and his mother is repeatedly described as the glue that holds the school together and keeps everything functioning smoothly!

El tumor mide unos 18 por 11 centmetros, y ejerce presin sobre sus pulmones y su corazn, haciendo difcil la respiracin. Aparentemente no es canceroso, pero est creciendo y requiere ciruga de inmediato.Como es comn con la gente de Mxico, los Esparza no cuentan con el tipo de seguro mdico necesario para cubrir los gastos de la ciruga, la estada en el hospital, y otras necesidades relacionadas a esto que la familia debe pagar cuando se realice el tratamiento. El costo estimado es de US $15,000.Dado que Aarn necesita tener esta ciruga lo ms pronto posible, como comunidad de la escuela pensamos que la manera ms rpida de levantar estos fondos es a travs de GoFundMe.

Some things you can help with like helping get a house and some you cannot like my hope to see my daughter at least go through kindergarten in 2017.   A little about me? Of course. I used to work with children in one way or another for 15 years but many of my favorite jobs were with preschool children with special needs and traumatized youth in foster care. This year Ive had to stop doing my dream career because the ALS/Lou Gehrig's diesease has caused a broken ankle and eaten my hands away so badly just to type this has taken 20 minutes. I've also had to stop doing all of my hobbies to help me de-stress. Without use of my hands I can't play video games, draw my art, crochet or even brush my daughter's hair I have a beautiful, smart and fiesty 5 year old who is being brave through all this. My fiance and partner of almost 12 years is crushed but also a huge support. They are my world and the reason I have overcomed all other adversities.    This new hurdle is my last but I going out fighting to the bitter end. One thing we need is a house because the stairs are a hassle in my apartment and there is no wheelchair access avaible. That is not the only reason I hope to move into a house before the ALS takes me. My dream has always been to have a home that is ours to have memories in. As a child I moved a lot in foster care and was often homeless but I hope to offer my daughter the stability of always having a place to call home no matter where she is. I was also hoping to get married in our home so that could be our first memory there but I do not wish to risk passing before I get to married the love of my life so we are hoping for a simple quick marriage at the court house as soon as possible after my daughters birthday. Last reason a home is so important to me is because when I do pass I have requested to have my ashes be used to grow a giant Weeping Willow tree to in the yard for my daughter to always have me close. She says she will take care of me as a tree and read me stories and tell me all about her day in school. I hope this can be a small comfort in helping my daughter and soon to be husband cope with my loss.   ____________________________________________________ If we can get to $5,000 that will all be used for a down payment on a home. Anything passed that will be used for medical bills and equipment (motorized wheelchair and oxygen), ramps and anything to help me in dealing with ALS. I am also hoping to use some small amount of money to help my soon-to-be husband adopt our daughter so I know that my sweet baby will stay with her loving father. Getting these few dreams complete before I go would mean the world to me because I know my family and friends could instead focus on being a support for me in this hard time.   Thank you for taking the time to read because as I now have learned, every second is precious. Please help me by sharing my story. If you can't donate please share a positive story about us or anything positive because this is a hard topic for us all Thank you<3___________________________________________________________ Medical ProofThis photo my daughter drew is her saying I'm strong. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"
Help Vicky Fight This Rare Aneurysm,"$14,020 ","$50,000 ",Medical," February 19, 2016",103,7,NAPLES,FL,1400,2,4,"                            Bart Lewis                                                                                        on behalf of Tony HowardNAPLES, FL                                                        In July of 2013, Vicky and Tony were leaving to go fishing when the doctor called. The results of a recent test were in. ""Get her to the hospital now,"" he said.For the two and a half years since, Vicky has been fighting the effects of an extremely rare, extremely large aneurysm. The aneurysm is located in the deepest and most sensitive part of the brain, making treatment options limited. Only a few neurosurgeons on earth have treated these, and she is currently being treated bysome of the world's best at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix.In the image below, the large egg-shaped bright spot is the aneurysm, right between the two lobes of her brain, embedded in the brain stem.After her most recent surgery, she will need to wait six months before the team at Barrow can do a thorough post operative assessment.  She needs our help now to cover tens of thousands of dollars of medical and housing expenses they have incurred. For example, including medical personnel, the special pressurized low altitude flight to take her home to Virginia from Arizona will cost approximately $26,000 alone--and it is not covered by insurance. In addition to the expenses they have accrued during their stay in Phoenix, they will have more out of pocket expenses after they return. Then in six months, they will need to repeat the trip.To learn more details about Vicky's medical struggles, please check out Tony's posts on Facebook atVicky's Story.My cousin Tony met Vicky at the local theater when he was 14 and she was 13, and they've been together ever since.  They share an enduringlove, and Tony's fight for her during this ordealhas been as inspirational as it is tragic. A retired Marine pilot, Tony exemplifies Semper Fidelis. Always Faithful.Their daughter, Tori, has sacrificed much duringher teenage years to help care for her mother, and she is currently in Virginia finishing her last year of High School.Vicky is one of the most compassionate, selfless people I have ever met. For a nurse who has dedicated her professional life to healing others, being struck by this rare affliction is especially tragic.Vicky's goals in life are simple: devotion to God and family, to see her daughter graduate from High School and College and someday marry, to love her future grandchildren...and, of course, to go fishing again.We are thankful for anything you, your family, and your friends might be able to contribute--whether large or small. All donations go straight to Vicky and Tony. And I know that Vicky, Tony, and Tori will be overwhelmingly grateful for your help, your thoughts, and your prayers.Thank you for sharingthis with your contacts. Together we can make a difference.--Bart Lewis                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She was expected to die within 10 years. Instead she raised a beautiful daughter who is now a junior high Math teacher, helped clean up a polluted lake in the Pelican flyway, and advocates for fair education for all of America's children. One of Dianna's doctors said ""she is too busy working on her projects to have time to die"".   Until now.  This past June, Dianna was hospitalized and is now on hospice. The doctors have already learned a lot from studying her body, but they are limited because they need to look at her body more closely.   Dianna is trying to raise the money needed to pay for the Pathologist so her body can be used so researchers can work for a cure for Muscular Dystrophy. (Dianna lives too far away to just let an ambulance take her to where the researchers are and it is illegal for doctors to pay for bodies).   Dianna has been on hospice before, but this time is different. One doctor said she has defied all odds by living from June until now, but she is declining daily. She now has severe swelling, her liver is swollen, breathing is extremelydifficult. She is down to weeks, no longer months.   Dianna has been one of those hard to diagnose. With DNA blood samples the doctors have determined Dianna has Muscular Dystrophy, but they need tissue samples to learn moreand confirm several hypotheses they have made based on Dianna's ability to have survived as long as she did. Until now, they had no way to gain those tissue samples.   To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. Dianna's season on this earth is coming to an endbut, as always, she saw this time as just another opportunity to bring people together to help others.  By donating to Dianna's Go Fund Me campaign, your dollars will support working toward a cure for Muscular Dystrophy. Please don't hesitate or postpone your contribution, time is of the essence. Dianna will be forever grateful, those who learn from her body will thank you, those who have Muscular Dystrophy will thank you.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

He was born a healthy 8 pounds 11 ounces. He was a healthy little/big boy. Shortly after that he started throwing up. So the nurses took him into the nursery. He then ended up in the nicu because of his heart rate plummeting and he lost all color. They started working on what was wrong with him in the nicu. He then started to swell in his tummy really bad. So they thought it was just fluid. They catheterized his belly and in doing so found that it was not fluid but was in fact blood. He had internal bleeding. They had no idea where the bleeding was coming from. He then started getting worse. They were suctioning blood from his mouth. And from the catheter. His blood pressure was super low which could cause damage to all his other organs. So they ended up life flighting him to hershey medical center in pa. We got here and his swelling was only getting worse. They decided to finally do emergency surgery (which was risky because he isn't clotting so there was a possibility that he could keep bleeding). When they finally got the surgery going they found where the bleeding was coming from. It was from the back side of his liver. So they packed it and left his belly open to kind of watch everything. They also ended up finding that parts of his intestines were no longer good. They also decided to give him a stoma. They then did the 2nd surgery at only 3 days old to make sure it stopped bleeding and that it was healing itself. There was no more bleeding but he is still in critical condition. His numbers are looking good but his swelling is going to get worse before it gets better. They also are checking his kidneys to make sure that the nonfunction was just from the pressure of swelling and not due to them just being bad. We have a long road ahead of us. And with living an hour and a half away we will be staying at the Ronald McDonald house for however long it takes for him to be able to come home. But i know a lot of people wanted to be able to help with finances support and transportation. I will keep everyone posted the more we know but right now he is still critical.

A 12 yr. old boy should not be worrying about such things.As Billy proclaimed in a 2012 Pittsburgh television interview, ""all I want to do is walk, to walk for all my life"".This page has been created to help eliminate Billy's worries & to fund Billy's medical needs and current and future medical expenses and equipment that he may need and not covered by medical coverage.  At this time, I am striving to keep him in his current home and only neighborhood that he has ever known......this will offer him stability while he endures a lifetime of treatment for his rare disease. Our current home will need modifications for Billy's ease and comfort & this fund will help with these needed changes. This is Billy's big wish, please help grant this wish to keep him in his current home & neighborhood.For those of you that know Billy or have gotten to know him through the many pictures, videos, & media posted, he truly is a joy to be with. He would want all of you to know that he is indeed, ""funny and lively"".                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

An ultrasound of the heart was done on Thursday, July 28th and showed possble heart defects. She was transferred to one of the best children's hospital in Wisconsin for further analysis and we were told Emilyn had a coaraction of the aorta and an av canal defect.Inevitably she would need 2 open heart surgeries, one for the coarctation of the aorta and one for the av canal defect. Her first open heart surgery took place on Fri., Aug. 5th for the coarcation of the aorta, which was succesful. She will undergo the 2nd open heart surgery to fix the av canal in about 4 months at which point the doctors say her heart will be bigger and stronger. This surgery will require another hospitalization with a possible 3-4 week recovery, once again. In which we will once again be living at the Ronald McDonald House Charities in Madison and the hospital. As of August 14, Emilyn is on day 9 of post-op recovery and slowly trying her best to be a healthy baby and go home.As you can imagine our normal life has been turned upside down and put on ""pause"" while we are here at the hospital caring for our sweet Emilyn. We thank everyone that has had her in their prayers and everyone that has helped us so far with donations, advice, support and taking care of Kaitalyn.We are hopeful to go home by the end of September so Emilyn can begin to lead a normal baby life. We pray for a healthy recovery for not only this surgery, but a safe and successful one for the second surgery in the coming months.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

LVIf you can afford to give $5, $10, $20 or more please do.Thank you very much!CareerBorn Agatha Nathalia Weston in Detroit, Michigan, she was signed to Motown in 1961, scoring a minor hit with ""Love Me All the Way"" (R&B #24, Pop #88). Weston's biggest solo hits with Motown were ""Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)"" (R&B #4, Pop #50, 1965, later covered by the Isley Brothers,Blood, Sweat & Tears, Jermaine Jackson and the Doobie Brothers, and ""Helpless"" (R&B #13, Pop #56, entered Cashbox March 26th, 1966, previously recorded by The Four Tops on their Second Album LP). Her biggest claim to fame was singing the classic hit ""It Takes Two"" with Marvin Gaye in 1966 and her later recording of the Black National Anthem, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"".[1]It was the success of ""It Takes Two"" that caused Motown to partner Gaye withTammi Terrell, spawning even more success for the label.The Kim Weston Biography -Stealth BelterShe's always been less visible than her Motown soul sisters. This Kim Weston biography should help bring her place--or, for some, her existence!--in R&B/soul history to light.Agatha Natalie Weston first materialized in Detroit on December 30, 1939. The girl with the old-sounding name must have been quite mature, vocally, for she started performing at age 3 in church choirs. By adolescence, she'd made her voice known to the outside world, touring with the gospel-singing Wright Specials.She didn't need to drift too far from her city. Her zesty style compelled Johnny Thornton to record some demos with her.Cutting tracks for a local songwriter? Flattering! Cutting tracks for a local songwriter who was a cousin of Eddie and Brian Holland? Fateful.Weston became a Motown artist in 1961 when the company was still fresh. Surely her rich, wide-ranging vocals would stand out in that modest environment.... In 1963, ""Love Me All the Way"" did wink onto the R&B charts. As if snubbing that title's request, though, Motown would give less-than-abundant attention to the singer.The Kim Weston biography picks up some notable figures as the years pass. A&R man and future husband Mickey Stevenson. Holland-Dozier-Holland, who provided Weston's greatest solo hit in 1965, ""Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)."" Duet partner Marvin Gaye, from 1964's ""What Good Am I Without You"" and the 1966 album Take Two.(For a list of her singles and albums, click here.) Yet Kim Weston herself gained nowhere near the same renown as those gents, or ladies like Martha Reeves and Diana Ross. ""Dancing in the Street"" could have changed that in 1964, but Weston's ""no"" gave the Vandellas a victorious ""yes!!"" that summer.Solo singles like ""Helpless"" kept her name out there, although few were looking for it. The weak promotional muscle behind Weston's career didn't help.As the Kim Weston/Marvin Gaye smash, ""It Takes Two,"" was maxing out in 1967, Weston and Stevenson erased themselves from Motown's payroll. MGM welcomed them both. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZriA11mjtY+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Andrew's parents are Jaime Hagerty O'Neil (myone and only sister)and Brian O'Neil . They reside in the eastern Pittsburgh region. Andrew has a 7 year-old brother Matthewwhoabsolutely adores him. April 15th, 2015 is a day our family will never forget!Itwas the dayAndrew was taken to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh ER by his parents after some ongoing symptoms that progressively worsened and it was the night we found outAndrew had a large tumor on his kidney. The phone call I received from my sister telling me what was happening was one that I will never, everforget in my lifetime. Initially,Andrew's parentswere toldthat they thoughthe had aWilm's tumor on his kidney and that he was going to have surgery the next day to remove his entire kidney/tumor. Later that evening,his family was informed that surgery was cancelled and there were thoughts that the tumor mightbe much more involved than just a Wilm's tumor.After surgical biospy of the tumor and bone marrow along withmany other nuclear tests/scans, it was determined that Andrew had a Stage3, high-risk, neuroblastoma that was not operable at the present time.This was not the news that Andrew's parents were hoping for because it meant that he would undergo a very, veryaggressive treatment plan that willinclude6 rounds of inpatient chemotherapy to shrink the tumor,a majorsurgery, stem cell harvesting/transplant therapy, radiation and maintenance retinoid therapy/immunotherapy. It is estimated that his entire treatment program will take 1 and 1/2 yearsto complete. This aggressive approach is necessary to save Andrew's life!! So, on 4/24/15 heinitiated his first round of chemo and his fightbegan. And on that day, so did our family's fight begin! A fight for life, a fight to keep a family unit together, a fight for normalcy, and a fight to keep all of the things that Andrew's parents have worked so hard to give their family. This Go Fund Me pledge is being made to help Andrew and his family be able to fight this battle with less financial burden and hardship...as the costs that will be incurred with frequent hospitalizations,chemotherapy, radiation,and stem cell therapy will be astronomical. It will likely mean extended periods of time off of work for one or both parents and possibly even one of them needing to stay homeregularly (both parents currently work full-time)to care for Andrew through this difficult time in their lives! ILOVE my family with all my heart and souland our entire family will be at their side during this fight. There has been an overwhelming response and desire to help from friends, family, co-workers, and the community. This fund will give everone interested the opportunity to help when and where it is needed. Please, please, please help us help them...so they can focus all of their energy into helping Andrew beat neuroblastoma.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Everything! is what I told her.Ive recently been diagnosed with cancer. Multiple myeloma to be precise. Its a blood cancer that occurs in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. My plasma cells have become malignant and have in turn weakened my bones. Ive just finished my first round of chemotherapy and will have to go through chemo for at least another six months. After that I need to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant and then more chemotherapy. The cancer was caught in the middle stages. Im lucky!Let me tell you a little about myself and how everything has changed.I love running. Im an avid runner and fitness enthusiast. I like sport and am an ardent supporter of the Olympic movement. I am part of a running club called the Urban Swaras and on any given day, you would find me galloping across parts of Nairobi and its environs.Running was my thing. It gave me the space to escape, think and fly. Id test myself. I learnt to push myself. I cant run right now because the cancer has compromised my spine and for now Ive got to wear a corset to protect it, so Ive started walking lots, which I also enjoy.Im also a lover of the arts and culture and love what is happening in this sector; not just in Nairobi, but across the continent. This is where Africa is really rising!! I love this continent. It confuses, angers and excites me! Mama Africa, does that to you.Im a lover of letters! I used to joke that my life was about the three Rs: Running, Reading and wRiting (You see what I did there)!A couple of years ago, I became a published writer, having edited a book on Kenyas queer community. The publishing of Invisible was a pivotal milestone in my journey and the journey of the Kenyan queer narrative. I like to think of myself as a quasi-activist on a number of social issues. I like to describe myself as a storyteller. I believe that through my journalistic work, I am a custodian of peoples stories. I love stories of people. I think they have power. They plant something good within us. Little did I know that I too would one day be the subject of a story. My story.My treatment is going well so far, although its going to be a long journey to recovery. I am on oral treatment and receive a weekly injection. Ive developed a new respect for medicine and my body. The chemo has and will continue to throw surprises at it. My body is dealing with so much right now and I have to spur it on and listen to it more in order to help it fight and recover. Looking ahead, the autologous stem cell transplant can only be done outside the country. Unfortunately I have to cover a part of with the high cost of cancer treatment myself. My insurance doesnt cover the full cost of treatment. This is why we are running this campaign to raise money to cover the cost of the medication and surgery.Since the diagnosis, Ive been overwhelmed by the support that I have received from family and friends. Ive had messages of encouragement and prayers from all quarters! These have left me speechless many, many times.Im still smiling and learning to tread a journey that requires not only the pace of a runner, but a similar determination. Its a new journey, a new race and a new normal. As part of my new normal, I am requesting your support to help me walk this journey and win this race.Walk with me.KevinNB:Many have asked about how to making donations locally.

Cindy is fighting the big fight against an extremely rare cancer called Osteosarcoma.Cindy has been a waitress for years. She started having pain in her ankle and hobbled around for weeks, working to make ends meet on an extremely painful foot. After bouncing around from doctor to doctor for about 3 weeks, she finally had an MRI. We were shocked to find out that she had Osteosarcoma, a bone cancer that has also caused a soft tissue malignant tumor in her ankle. This type of cancer is extremely rare!!! 1-3 people in a million have it in the foot. It is especiallyrare for adults. Cindy's amazing husband Curtis is working overtime to meet their financial needs. Their 8 year old son is the most incredible little dude I know! His mommy is his whole world!! He is being very brave and has already named her soon to be prosthetic, ""Root"" for robotic foot!Please help Cindy and her beautiful family with her expenses as she will be doing 6 weeks of intense chemotherapy, surgery to amputate her foot at the shin and then at least 6 more weeks of chemo. She will be fit for a prosthetic. Thankfully, she has the best doctors down in Boston at Mass General and Beth Israel. Cindywill be out of work for months. The tumor has encased important vessels in her foot and radiation won't be able to shrink the tumor enough to safely allow the doctor to remove the cancer and reconstruct her foot properly without the worry of reoccurring cancer, multiple surgeries of reconstruction and plastic surgery with months of rehab. This is why chemo and amputation are the chosen treatments.Thank you so much for all of your support! Cindy is an incredible woman and she is humbledby all of the love and support!

Always humor. She is magnetic, a friend to all, old or young, or having just been introduced.Darcy continues to face a feat that is unimaginable. Each day she is doing everything to overcome cancer, while her family provides all care possible to ease her discomfortsgiving great attention to what she can eat, to immense emotional support, or covering the many miles for her treatment. Words cant convey the severity Darcy and her family are facing, or the intensity of Darcys illness. As of a few months ago, she had cancer in multiple places throughout her bodyshe underwent chemo, and also needed full brain radiation after suffering multiple seizures because the cancer had spread. Most recently, it has been determined there are new spots on Darcys heart, among other places. Those who know Darcy can vouch to her strength, as an individual, daughter, partner, sister, mother, friend she is an admirable, courageous force. The Blethens are determined and are not giving up hope. They are scheduled to fly with Darcy to Austria for treatment at the Kleef Integrative Oncology Center this coming week. And despite the incredible community support, Darcys family has had to take many days from work to be with her throughout her care, and if not with Darcy, their daughter, Sydney. The bills insurance will not cover are mountainous, and beyond what anyone should have to consider while going through such an exhausting struggle. It is a very stressful hardship. Lets all donate somethinganything, so that Darcy can afford the chance of health. Most importantly, so she and her family can do so with as little stress possible. And if anyone should face a miracle, it is this amazing woman and her family. Donate and lets bring Darcy home from Austria healthy. The Blethen family is endlessly grateful.

Dad is in his second year of cancer treatment so donations will be used immediately and throughout the duration of his care. Dad, our mom Joni, sister Missy and us twin brothers are very close and this journey has brought us even closer as we fight daily to see victory. Dad has a good chance at life with more chemo ahead once he fully recovers from the latest surgery. After Dad passed out while working almost 2 1/2 years ago, and then finding out there was a tumor and cancer, the tough news hit hard. Dad is the sweetest most selfless person who even now going through all the surgeries, hospitals, and nursing facilities, still finds ways to encourage us as we hold his hand, listening to his stories. Any donation will be incredibly helpful and appreciated as there is so much going on, and so many expenses involved. We ask that you please keep Dad and all of us, in your thoughts and prayers as this road continues for our family.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Bob Troiso's Cancer Fund,"$7,520 ","$5,000 ",Medical," September 20, 2016",77,4,CLEARWATER,FL,468000,3,,"                            Lisa Argianas Troiso                                                                                                                   CLEARWATER, FL                                                        Hi, my name is Lisa Troiso. My husband Bob and I have been together since we were 15 years old. We have been married for 33 years, together for 38. We have 3 children and 2 beautiful granddaughters and a brand new grandson. Bob has always been a hard worker, and an avid fisherman. He loves being outdoors, even in the Florida heat. He was self-employed, the owner of a lawn maintenance business which he had started with his father 35 years ago. On May 22, 2015 at 11:00 pm our life as we new it drastically changed forever. Bob, a strong hard working 53 year old man was walking into the kitchen to get a drink of water, when he suddenly fell to the floor. Without any indication other than what he thought was maybe a pulled groin muscle, his right femur had snapped just below his hip. At the hospital, it raised a red flag to the doctors. Why did the strongest bone in an otherwise strong, healthy man, break without reason? After several days and a biopsy, he was diagnosed with Large Diffuse B Cell non Hodgkins Lymphoma. His leg was surgically repaired with a titanium rod implant. It was determined that a tumor attached itself to the bone and weakened it. Now with a broken leg and a diagnosis of cancer, he had to start 6 months of chemotherapy treatments. He was unable to work after his diagnosis and lost his business. Chemotherapy was very hard on him, but he got through it. In January of 2016 we were told he was cancer free. He was just starting to feel like his old self again when he felt a lump in his neck. In April he was re diagnosed with lymphoma, omce again requiring another series of a different and stronger chemotherapy. This series requires him to stay a minimum of three days in the hospital every 21 days for 3 cycles. His oncologist called a colleague at Moffitt Cancer Center and he was referred for consult for an Autologous Stem Cell transplant . An autologous transplant (or rescue) is a type of transplant that uses the person's own stem cells. These cells are collected in advance and returned at a later stage. They are used to replace stem cells that have been damaged by high doses of chemotherapy, used to treat the person's underlying disease. Autologous transplants are used to treat a number of different blood cancers, theyallow the use of high dose chemotherapy, which provides some people with a better chance of cure or long-term control of their disease.The doctors there decided he is a good candidate for this procedure and they accepted him. There is a 60% chance this can cure him. Vital organ testing began. After a lumbar puncture to test his cerebral spinal fluid for cancer he developed migraine like headaches. An MRI showed he had some blood collected on his brain. We are not sure where it came from, but it is a set back, He just underwent surgery to remove the blood. This needed to be done before he can proceed with the transplant process. It has not been easy. It seems like every time we get one step ahead, something kicks us back a step. I have insurance through my job which thankfully has covered a lot of his medical expenses over the last year and a half, but we have been living on my paycheck alone and it has become increasingly more difficult to pay our household bills, as well as all of the medical bills and the medicine copays we are responsible for. We have exhausted any savings we had and are living day to day. When the actual transplant takes place he will be in the hospital, which is 45 minutes from our home, for up to 3 weeks and then upon discharge we will have to stay in a hotel for up to 2 weeks as we need to be within 15 minutes of the hospital for all follow up procedures.I don't often ask for help, but we really need it at this time. Our lives have been turned upside down. Once the transplant takes place, Bob has a long recovery ahead of him, it is going to be very difficult, but with the love and support of our family and friends he can overcome any obstacle. He keeps saying that he just can't wait to be his old Bob self again. I know soon, that day will come again. With your help it will make each day a little easier on him. Not being able to provide for his family as he has for the last 35 years is devastating to him. I work for the Pinellas County School district. I get paid every two weeks. You can believe there is not much money coming in after insurance and taxes are taken out..I am asking for your help. Anything you can give to help Bob and our family through this tough time would be greatly appreciatedThanks for your continued support, love and prayers!                    + Read More"

Kyla Rose's Medical Support Fund,"$18,735 ","$20,000 ",Medical," March 16, 2015",290,18,FLOYD,VA,1000,,28,"                            Amy Avery                                                                                        on behalf of Leigh RaineyFLOYD, VA                                                        On February 25th, 2015 after weeks of breathing difficulty that was believed to be pneumonia, Kyla Rose was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM occurs when disease affected muscle fibers are enlarged or stretched (dilated) in one or more chambers of the heart. As the heart enlarges, it decreases its efficiency in pumping blood through the body. When the disease progresses to congestive heart failure, fluid can build up in the lungs, as is the case for Kyla.The first echocardiogram was done during her very first visit to pediatric cardiology in Roanoke at Community Hospital. On Monday, March 16th, she had surgery to plant a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator in her chest at UVA Medical Center in Charlotteville, VA.This device will help her stay alive, but it will not fix any of the problems with her heart. It is there to shock her heart if it goes into ventricular fibrillation. The doctors have called it a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3scenario: 1/3 of a chance for getting better, 1/3 of a chance for staying the same, or 1/3 of a chance for getting worse. The lifestyle choices she makes, and medicines she continues on will be what might (a big might) help her improveThis fund will go to help support the family in this time of upheaval. Bills still need to get paid, rent and food covered, and the time in recovery and traveling to and from the hospital adds up quickly in expenses. Thank you all for your love and support. Please continue to hold Kyla, Mara and all their family closely in your hearts and pray they are guided through this process with gentle hands.Update on Feb 6, 2016Update on Kyla:It is my sincere hope that the week-long treatment Kyla received at UVA last week will allow her a respite, however brief, because the excess fluid that was contributing to her symptoms has decreased. She was on IV diuretics the entire time she was at UVA and lost about 10 pounds in a week, most of which was fluid build up. She's now on stronger diuretics and we'll be keeping a close eye on her potassium levels to make sure they stay as stable as possible since they have a direct effect on her heart function.While we were there, Kyla was denied entry into UVA's transplant program because she is, at this time, deemed ""too weak"" to survive the surgery. We are actively seeking a second opinion and will likely be pursuing evaluation at Duke because their criteria is different than UVA's. For example, they have performed heart transplants on patients in their 70's. UVA does not accept transplant recipients who are over 70.As we left the hospital on Wed (literally only an hour or two after she was discharged), we received a call from a neurologist Kyla saw last August through a MDA clinic. They performed another series of genetic tests that were evaluated at Emory and those tests revealed other genetic mutations, possibly resulting in a condition called ""Bethlem's Myopathy."" I am in dialogue with Kyla's genetic counselor at UVA, who is cross-comparing the new info with the results we received in June in consultation with Kyla's neurologist at UVA, as well as (hopefully) the researchers at Emory who found the other mutations. We will meet with him next Thurs, Feb 11, after Kyla's post-hospitalization follow-up with the heart failure clinic. We will also be following up with her neurologist in Roanoke on March 8th. In the meantime, I am aggressively seeking referrals to Duke's transplant program and working with Physical Medicine and Rehab doctors to (hopefully) determine Kyla's ability to strengthen. It appears as if she will be able to, carefully, since the cardiac condition precludes any strenuous physical therapy. But at the moment that's still anyone's best guess. Reducing the fluid may help some with her symptoms but will not address the issue of muscle wasting.We deeply appreciate being home with our strong support system in Floyd. Though we were considering a potential move to UVA, given the need to be as close as possible if she were accepted for transplant, that decision is currently in stasis. We're about 3 hours away from both Duke and UVA at the moment and have a decent maintenance program close by that will take care of immediate needs. If necessary, Kyla can be stabilized at a hospital close to home and transported to Durham or Charlottesville. She rode in an ambulance from Radford to UVA last week given that she was not stable enough to be transported without life support equipment close by.The process of uncovering the latest diagnostic information in order to reach a prognosis will involve a whole new bunch of minds in the mix, and considering the circumstances, the more people participating in the dialogue the better.For now, we're monitoring Kyla's weight and vital signs closely and reporting them to our team at UVA on a daily basis. We'll be reassessing her physical therapy program based on transplant criteria and working towards that goal in whatever ways we can. And as always, we are so grateful for the love and support from all of you. Thank you for walking this difficult road with us and for bearing witness as we move forward.~Mara                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

After six long months of being a medical mystery, Richie was diagnosed with BuddChiari syndrome, a condition caused by a blockage within the veins that drains the liver. It is very rare and only occurs in 1 out of a million individuals. Although its a relief to finally identify the cause of the medical anomalies over the past 4 years, this diagnosis is serious. Richie needs a new liver.For those of you who dont know Richie, he is a great friend, a son, a brother, a dog owner, and perhaps most importantly, a genuinely good person. Hes the type of guy who would do anything for his friends or family. I remember in college over winter break when Richie drove 8 hours to DC just to surprise me on my birthday. I shouldnt have been surprised when he showed up the following year too. If you talk to his other friends and family I guarantee that they will have similar stories of Richie's selflessness.Maybe some of you are reading this sitting at work just waiting for the weekend. Well try waiting on a life-saving organ. The average wait time on a liver transplant is 11 months. Richie is on the organ transplant waiting list but in the meantime, he needs our support. Richie has insurance which will cover a good portion of his medical expenses, but as we all know, there will be deductibles, countless copays, significant time off work, and living expenses that will continue to pile up over the next year. It is important that Richie spends his time and energy on a speedy recovery rather than worrying about mounting medical debt. Luckily for Richie, he has an amazing family, loyal friends, and supportive co-workers. Lets show Richie how much we truly love and care about him. ALL donations go directly to Richie and will be deeply appreciated. Thank you very much for your generosity.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She knows that this is just part of the journey and hope you will continue to hope and pray alongside her.We visited Lyn after her surgery yesterday. What we thought was going to be a 2 hour surgery turned into 5 hours. The cancer prevents Lyn from taking in any food right now so she will be given TPN as her nutrition through her port. Her husband Jerry and 2 kids Cami and Brayden were there when we arrived. It was a long day for all of them and may be a longer recovery but with this GoFundMe account, we hope to use every dollar to fund her Vitamin C treatments that have worked in the past. Thank you all for every dollar you pour in to this account. I am sure it will also help to cushion unexpected financial burdens for the Merza familyWe love you Lyn!!!

Trying to describe Ashley in one word is impossible. No matter how you know Ashley, you know that her love for her four amazing, talented and thoughtful children drives everything she does. Ashley is hardworking and loyal, going above and beyond for her family, friends, coworkers and patients. Ashley is thoughtful and caring, always willing to lend a hand. Unfortunately, there is a new word to describe Ashley: patient. Ashley has been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a rare form of cancer that effects the bone. This last week, Ashley learned that she has four bone tumors (femur, sternum, and two spinal) and that she will require surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. The largest of the tumors, located in her femur, requires that she use crutches at all times. Ashley, the hardest working person I have ever met, is unable to work. She is unable to do a job she loves, or provide for her family, while she faces the challenge of having cancer and raising her kids. As heartbreaking as it is to think of this strong, loyal, hardworking woman being diagnosed with cancer, it is also an opportunity. This is an opportunity to show Ashley just how thankful we are for her. We have the opportunity to pour out love and give her comfort during a difficult and scary time. Your donation will help ease the financial burden of her lost income, helping to pay her mortgage, utilities and medical costs, as well as the costs associated with having 4 active kids. Even more, your donations will show Ashley that her and Gary are not alone in her journey as a cancer survivor. Please help me show Ashley that Team Bond is bigger and stronger then she ever imagined!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

She has managed to find a way to live with the pain, but has reached the point where surgery is the only way forward. Kerry just had surgery to implant a feeding tube to strengthen her bodyfor the removal of her pancreas inMay. Depending upon her successingaining nourishment, she will have to travel seven hours to attend counseling /educational sessions to prepare her for the surgery and for a life without a pancreas. The surgical procedure is called Total Pancreatectomy with Isalet Auto-Transplant (TP IAT). Post surgery, she will be confined to the hospital for 6-9 weeks and must have a friend or relative with her during her stay. Kerry has medical insurance but doesn't have disability insurance or short term home healthcare insurance and must pay for these types of living and healthcare expenses out of pocket. With post-operative morbidity rates for TP IAT of 36-39%,home healthcare after surgery is vital. Without it her chances of morbidity occurring are increased drastically. For example, if any suture ruptures, toxicity can take her life within six hours. Kerry is the Institute Director at the Standing Rock Institute of Natural History but will not be able to partake in any dinosaur digs this summer, or the excavation of her magnificent find last summer, which is devastating for her. She lives a very active lifestyle but is now grounded until she recovers from the surgery which could take over one year. Kerry has been an athlete all of her life and once played semi and pro-soccer for the Hampton Roads Piranhas in Virginia as a midfielder and backup goal keeper. She still enjoys playing softball in Mobridge, SD, hunting, golfing, photography, painting pictures, travel and horseback riding. Kerry is a 44 year old mother to two young men, Spencer and Dominick, and is paying to put her youngest through college at SUNY Delhi, a State Universtity in upstate Delhi, New York.Ms. Libby will endure this very crucial surgery to remove herpancreas, then havethe islet (eye-let) cells from her deteriorating pancreas transplanted back into her own liver, which will then attempt to act as a host and begin to produce insulin in due time. She will become an immediate diabetic and will have to consume enzyme pills for the remainder of her life to digest food. Please help Kerry with her medical expenses (40% coinsurance, deductibles, medical home infusion costs, home healthcare) for the next year so she can get back to her old active self.The following website for the University of Minnesota Medical Center where the surgery will be performed, explains Total Pancreatectomy and Iselt Auto-Transplant: ( https://www.mhealth.org/Care/Treatments/Total-Pancreatectomy-and-Islet-Auto-transplant-Adult)+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

My name is Jane Carvey and I am paralyzed (from the chest down) due to a spinal cord injury from a bicycle accident 17 years ago. It was a devastating, life altering experience that effected not only me but my family and friends as well. My life was turned upside down realizing I was permanently resigned to living in a wheelchair and unable to perform the simplest of tasks. What I was totally unprepared for was the cost of all the equipment and assistance that would be needed on a daily basis.On a yearly basis it is necessary to budget an additional $70,000-$85,000 to provide for basic needs. This includes caregivers which could cost up to $150 or more a day. Purchasing durable medical equipment (a shower chair, wheelchair and repairs, patient lifts, adapted automobile and repairs, hospital bed, commode, portable ramps, and smaller less expensive items such as under-pads, vinyl gloves, medications, various creams and ointments, catheter kits etc.). A wheel chair can cost up to $50,000, and insurance only covers 80%. A major expense came from adapting my house to make it suitable to get into most of the rooms and being able to reach and operate light switches, doorknobs, drawers, TV remotes and phones.17 years ago my community, friends, colleagues and family united to provide any support they could. There were fundraisers that raised up to $90,000 which enabled my family to modify our home and paid for much of the durable medical equipment that insurance would not cover. I was overwhelmed with the outpouring of support. Its saved me both physically and mentally. As low as my spirits were the community's support was a testament to what human kindness and generosity could do.My friend, Kurt Leschkies, just sustained a spinal cord injury in May. He fell off a beam while working on his own home and has paralysis from the chest down. By trade Kurt is a contractor for custom homes. He and his wife Yvonne (who is working for school district 118), were supportive of me back when I broke my neck. Kurt (who I didnt know at the time), built my deck with a ramp at no expense, would drive me around to various engagements, and came over to visit. His life is now turned upside down as mine was, but he has a fighting spirit and a positive attitude that will sustain him and help him to recover as much as possible.I pledge to make this transitional period in his life as easy as possible. Therefore I decided to set up this fundraiser in hopes that others will help in this endeavor. I figured its my turn to pay it forward. How about you.Sincerely,Jane Carvey+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

This GoFundMe campaign is to help Ben, Cyndi and Finn with their living and medical expenses as they navigate the long road to Bens recovery.On August 9th, while at a pool with his family for their friend's wedding in Jackson Hole, Ben was involved in a tragic diving accident. The results were devastating. The impact burst one vertebrae in his back while fracturing three others. He also suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), needed nine staples to close a deep head laceration, and his fifth rib was broken. Friends were able to pull Ben from the pool and he was rushed via ambulance to the ER in Jackson Hole. Ben was hospitalized and cared for in Jackson Hole at St. John's Medical Center for almost a week before being allowed to return to Salt Lake City for additional care.Ben is on a long and uncertain road to recovery, but thankfully, he has help. Currently, a number of specialists are treating his traumatic brain injury. There are also teams of physical and occupational therapists, spinal surgeons, and orthopedic specialists guiding the process of ensuring that Ben's back heals as quickly and properly as possible. This means that Ben is confined to a metal back brace and cant complete, or needs help with completing, most normal daily activities. His doctors are also doing their best to manage the constant pain that he is experiencing. Due to the TBI, doctors are taking a number of steps to help treat the negative effects that the brain injury has on Ben's everyday life. This includes removing anything that may over-stimulate Ben, since too much stimulus can cause additional brain damage and/or slow the healing process. Sadly, this means that the doctors have recommended that Finn stay with a friend or relative instead of his own home for the next few months. Doctors are also uncertain how long it will be before Ben is physically and mentally able to return to work. This has been a particularly tough year for the Meszaros. In addition to Ben's injuries, Cyndi was in the ICU in March for two weeks due to serious complications caused by her congenital heart defect (Cyndi has an artificial Mitral heart valve and takes blood thinners daily), and Ben's car was stolen from outside their home in June and has yet to be recovered. The Meszaros family has always been a source of encouragement and help for their friends and family. Needless to say, the Meszaros family is in need of our support and its time to give back.Well keep this page updated as Ben progresses, and we're hopeful that he will make a full recovery. Your support and generosity will help to cover the mounting medical bills, living expenses, and additional financial burdens that have been placed on the Meszaros family as a result of this accident. Any donation means the world to Ben, Cyndi and Finn and is extremely helpful. Thank you!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I know that they will be so immensely grateful when we present them with the funds we have raised,and I thank you from the bottom of my heart as well.
