                        Years ago, you enjoyed the award-winning short film Here Be Dragons, an introduction to critical thinking. And now, it's finally time for the sequel: Principles of Curiosity.I'm Brian Dunning from Skeptoid Media . Here Be Dragons was filmed by me in 3 weeks with a camcorder and a tripod with a budget of $6000, and admittedly, it shows. Principles of Curiosity takes everything 3 steps further. The content is all-new, it's being shot with state-of-the-art filmmaking and a professional crew, and it will be released in full HD.Principles of Curiosity teaches three simple rules that anyone can follow to separate good information from bad, and become prepared to make better life decisions. It's also going to be fun, funny, and entertaining for general audiences.Ever since Here Be Dragons came out, I've received lesson plans from all around the world made by teachers who use the film in classes, from junior high school through college. This time we're going to do that work for them. Principles of Curiosity is not just a film that everyone can enjoy -- it will be that, but for educators wanting more, it's also a cohesive lesson in applied critical thinking, teaching the skills of modern, relevant, scientific skepticism to students everywhere, teaching materials included. Teachers have already proven that they want this. We're going to give it to them.The budget has been set at $44,000, which is a minimum for the team we need, including production and post production crew, equipment, permits, insurance, and expenses, plus a chunk for the educators who will create the lesson plans, and a marketing plan to get the finished product into a short list of film festivals and a system for making the lesson plans and film available online. If you know anything about film production, you know that $44K is really, really, really cheap. There is a LOT we would like to do if we can get more money to fund it.We want you to help produce it. We want you to get your own copy. We even want you to be in it. Release is set for the first quarter of 2017. Please support this important & awesome new film.

                        My name is Dan Fontes, I was born in Oakland and painted the giraffe and zebra murals beneath Oaklands 580 freeway. I've been a practicing artist for 36 years. I need the funds for oil paint supplies, assistants stipends, photography, printing final poster and a small amount for my salary. Each of the animal figures takes two to three weeks each to restore. Originally painted in 1984-85 they've held up well but now need complete recoating. Hopefully they can all return by the end of Summer.  This project means everything to me. My murals are my children. Thank you all for any help offered!!!

Our Warrior Fighting Brain Cancer,"$13,255 ","$25,000 ",Creative," August 15, 2016",168,1,MARYSVILLE,PA,2600,8,9,"

                        I'll warn you all now this has been a long few months so this is a LONG story. As some of you may know for the last 2years we've had a perfectly healthy baby boy, up until about 5months ago and our world got turned upside down. We were living in Pittsburgh for about 3months when Cj's health started to decline. He started to randomly get sick, he would sleep all night and wake up in the morning and want to immediately go back to sleep, he had no energy, he wasn't himself, never wanted to play and if anyone knows our Cj that isn't him. He was still eating and drinking so we weren't too concerned. After about a week he stopped getting sick but was still fully not himself, then his right eye started to turn in. Then he began to get sick all over again. I went with my mommy instincts we took him to the ER. They did a CT scan, the nurse came back to tell us something was abnormal with his brain and we were getting admitted, like any normal parents reaction we started freaking out asking what does that mean, how does something like this happen, better yet what does abnormal mean?! Nothing was answered other than he needs an MRI and further testing. Cj got an MRI, it came back with he had fluid and pressure on his brain they did a spinal tap and found out that the pressure was at a 50% level when at his age it should've been between 17%-20%. We had no idea how this happened or what would randomly cause something like this to happen to him. All blood work came back negative for every virus, sickness, bacteria out there. He got put on a medicine called Diamox, after a week of being in the hospital, the medicine was working, his eye went back to normal, & he was his active, happy self. We got discharged with the medicine and thought everything was all said and done. A week later everything started happening again. Just to find out that everything was worse. The next day we were surrounded by doctors telling us Cj had to go into surgery that day to get a shunt, which would attach to his brain, travel down his neck and abdomen area so the fluid could drain and relieve the pressure. After surgery he was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus with no cause or reason. From May up until about a few weeks ago Cj has been doing great for the most part. A few weeks ago he was extremely off balance. We brought him to Hershey to get him checked out. They said the shunt was working fine and nothing seemed to be wrong he was probably just sick and told us to come back if anything got worse. Well guess what? Things got worse. Went for a second opinion, at this point no one could tell us much other than they thought he was having seizures. 2 weeks ago he threw up again. He dropped to his knees, got extremely pale, started to drool all over, and stopped responding to his name. We got transported by ambulance to the ER and they told us he was having a seizure. We went through more imaging and testing to find out his shunt needed replaced which was at this time the answer as to why he was having seizures. He went in for a revision all went well and we got discharged. 2 days later he threw up again, he went unconscious and wasn't responding. Rushed him to the ER, he got sent to the trauma bay right away. He was turning extremely pale, slightly blue and our happy, baby just wasn't there. He got resesitated, his oxygen levels were extremely low and he was in and out of this seizure for about 2hrs. We got admitted into intensive care. Next day he went down for more MRIs, CT scans, EEG, blood work, etc. The doctors didn't quite understand how Pittsburgh ruled Cj out with Hydrocephalus with no cause or reason. After everything was done we later got informed information NO parent wants to hear especially about their 2year old. ""Your son has a decent size tumor in the middle of his brain"" not sure if it is cancerous or not but it was there and they were going to do all that they could to get us the answers we've needed for months now. As you all know we are still here in Hershey Medical with no discharged date. Cj goes in for yet another surgery but this time an invasive brain surgery Wednesday morning. It'll take between 5-8hrs. The surgeon is going to remove the entire tumor unless he runs into any complications at that point he will stop the surgery and we will go an alternative route. It will then be sent off for further testing to see what we're dealing with. Either way our little one will be going through chemo treatment. Right now we are stuck in a tight situation with everything. One of us are currently not working due to constantly having to call off for emergency doctors appointments and work not understanding and the other has been needing to call off and forseeing it continuing to happen in the near future due to this invasive surgery, recovery, and chemo treatment. Between traveling from Hershey to Dillsburg for work when I can, traveling back and forth from home to here for things we need, buying odds and ends like toiletries and so forth, and paying to have to eat and drink every day is cutting money extremely tight on everything and bills coming up. None of us expect the money goal we have set I just picked an amount so it doesn't need to keep being adjusted, but any little bit helps. We hate even resorting to something like this but family and health comes first and our baby is coming first and doing what we need to do to get him better and back to his healthy self as much as we can. As you can see from the outside Cj does not look like there is anything wrong but on the inside I wish I could say it was the same. He's an amazing, strong little boy and we feel absolutely helpless there is nothing we can do to fix this. No hugs, kisses, snuggles, or love will eliminate his health issues. We are just doing the best we can to hold it together and be here for him as much as we can. We finally have answers now we need to focus on getting him better and the help he needs. Cj is our warrior and we are putting our faith and trust in Gods hands at this point. Thanks in advance for anyone that can help and took time to read this mess of a story, you all have no idea how much it will be appreciated!!Sincerely with grateful hearts,Craig Himmel II & Brittany Sultzaberger

KISSIMMEE, FL                                




We want to thank all that have helped us get this far. The film is done and we are now submitting to scores of film festivals. We have been made official selections for 6 festivals in less then 3 weeks after completing the film. Our mission now is to win some awards for the film while we help market and get the word out on CRPS. Almost every film takes this same course as the film makers have to find a home or homes for the film. The festivals help gain attention for the film and bring distribution that will allow the film to be seen by millions around the world. We are still raising funds to help cover the cost of the festivals and submitting and other travel related cost to attend and promote. Now is the critical time that we can use this moment to truly get back on many major shows and promote this condition. Now is the time for print and new papaers and scores of press. Once the film is out we wont be able to go back and get the word out so we are still working very hard each day to help this movement. We were just featured in Huffington Post and have many other great pieces coming on this disease. The world is now taking notice.



Trial By Fire is a documentary based on RSD/CRPS created by Celebrity Chef Charles Mattocks, as seen on CNN, Dr. Oz, The Today Show and many more mainstream media across the United States and around the world. Charles is also a best-selling author, World Diabetes Advocate and film-maker. Charles mother, who is the sister of the late legendary reggae legend Bob Marley, was diagnosed with RSD/CRPS about 4 years ago. Charles, who also recently lost his father from cancer, was moved to create Trial By Fire after seeing his fathers loss and wanting to help his mother who seemingly is at a point where he is in fear of losing two parents in a very short span.The first trailer for the film Trial by fire

Nancy Cotterman has been a great support to the film, her support group helps raise funds to pay for treatement. They will also be featured in the film.Charles became engulfed with RSD/CRPS. As a global face for diabetes who has traveled the world to educate and encourage people to live their best life, he saw a need to bring awareness to RSD/CRPS. While doing research, he also saw his own mother undergo procedures that seemingly seemed more about lining the doctors pockets then helping her with the pain. The film will follow 2 to 3 main characters, but tell the story of many with the condition.Charles recently teamed up with Nancy Cotterman and her RSD/CRPS support group where he spent the day filming the many stories. Nancy has been a great help along with the scores of people around the world that have sent him emails wanting this story to be told. Charles has also teamed up with Dr. Hannaout of Clear Water Florida to work alongside him and his team to help the world understand what RSD/CRPS is and some of the many treatments that have changed the lives of many. We have some great stories lined up and will follow the lives of not only his mother but a few others with the condition. This will be a moving and emotional piece that will bring much needed attention. Many ask why do we need help, Charles is an advocate and we are not wealthy, his passion for people has made him focus more on his work in diabetes then being a celebrity chef. So for a film like this to see the light of day it needs the support from those who are personally affected by RSD/CRPS.Some of those who are helping us move this forward, are fighters for those with CRPS. Big thanks toMaria Anne Tripp Martinez from TeaxsWe created this GoFundMe initiative because we need the support of people with the condition or those who support those living with the condition. We cant do it alone and it will take a village to support a great cause, hence this initiative to garner your support. The funds will go towards the shooting and the editing process. We would like to have more but we will make the best out of whatever we get. We would love to exceed our goals and have the resources to truly make this project one that can be seen by millions!Charles will work with the many shows he appears on to market and promote the film, such as CNN, Dr Oz, and others. He will also be covered by many news outlets allowing full exposure. His hope is to bring some serious eyes on the project so we can try and figure out how to cover some of the costs for treatment, make this a condition get more attention and support from bigger companies and help find ways to improve the lives of those with RSD/CRPS. We will also enter many major film festivals around the country and world where we know the film will win many major awards because of the content and subject matter. We are very close to having this conditions story shared.We will be shooting for about 2 weeks and the edit should take about one month. We would love your support, be it small or large, to help us move forward. Please review some of the links on Charles work to see his passion and how much he has done for diabetes worldwide. We need you to help get this to the people, this is a great opportunity for RSD/CRPS to have a voice!We are also looking for you to submit your video and your story, we can feature you in the film, all videos submitted will be reviewed and we will choose the ones that work with the film and time.

*NSYNC Star on Walk of Fame,"$5,750 ","$30,000 ",Creative," June 28, 2016",147,2,LOVES PARK,IL,3600,13,6,"

                        On June 28th 2016 *NSYNC was selected to receive a star on the Hollwood Walk of Fame for their success in the recording industry. This great honor means Lance, JC, Joey, Chris, and Justin will be forever recognized along side some of the biggest names in Hollywood. With this great honor comes a sponsorship fee, and we want this to be fully fan funded. This is our gift to these five incredibly talented men who set the world on fire with their music. The 30,000 dollar fee pays for the Star Ceremony, and maintenance of their lifetime place on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This is our chance to say ""Thank You"" to *NSYNC for the music, memories, and lifetime friendships they've given us. Please help by donating any amount you can and by spreading the word to other *NSYNC fans. Thank you for your support. The Official Lance Bass Street Team is sponsoring this campaign. This is the only official fundraising page for the star. We have been working with *NSYNC's management for two years on this gift for the group. GoFundMe requires withdrawals of money each month, they will be sent to a special savings account that I have set up. When the full sponorship fee has been raised we will be directly sending the money to the Hollywood Historic Trust a 501(c) charitable foundation. We will also send proof of funds update to all people who have donated so they know when the money has been paid.Feel free to tweet us with any questions @TeamLance @LBStreetTeam1 @LanceBassCntrl

Let's Replace Darren's Horn!,"$3,150 ","$3,150 ",Creative," September 21, 2016",75,4,MADISON,WI,214000,,2,"

                                                            on behalf of Darren Sterud

MADISON, WI                                





                        My name is Ben Ferris, and I am setting this campaign up in hopes of organizing the community to help out a friend and musician, Darren Sterud.Last Sunday at the Willy St. Fair, Darren Sterud was attacked on stage by an audience member who hurled a cell phone at Darren's face. While his bruises will heal, the damage done to his horn is too extensive to repair. Darren is a professional musician, and his trombone is not only a big part of his artistic voice, but also one of the most important tools in his trade.If you are interested, the police report can be read here or the Madison.com article read here. Darren's instrument that was maliciously destroyed will cost$3100 to replace. All of the funds donated on this site will go directly to the costs of replacing his horn.Darren did not want to have a campaign like this started, as he feels like it is his responsibility to replace the instrument. After some conversations with a number of close friends, Darren said that we could do this if we like, but he would not feel comfortable endorsing it. Darren is not asking for money to replace his instrument, we are simply activatingSOCIAL/COMMUNITY INSURANCE. It is easy to say ""make the guy pay for it"" but in reality, that could take years and might not even happen. Many instrument insurance policies, including Darren's do not cover damage, only theft. If we all give a little, we can put this thing in the past quickly and move on.We all benefit from Darren's music; some of us directly through hearinghim play in one of the many groups he performs with, or as hisstudent; others indirectly by living in a community such as ours that is a better place to live in in partbecause of things that Darren does. So let's do this QUICK and GET IT DONE WITH - Let's REPLACE DARREN'S HORN!!

"Patty's Release of ""Let In The Sun""","$1,560 ","$10,000 ",Creative," September 21, 2016",42,4,SILVER SPRING,MD,197000,,2,"

                        Ever since I was a kid I found the greatest comfort and fun in music. It was where I belonged and could find some peace and understanding - my own private little world in my room with my records. The dream to actually play and perform came eventually and I worked hard and happily to build a life playing music. You are the biggest part of that dream - where would I be without fellow music lovers? I am so very blessed to pursue that which I love and also to have you as my fellow travelers. It is my greatest hope that the songs I have written or covered over the years have touched your lives in a way that is meaningful and lasting. It is my great joy and privilege to perform for you. My dream for my new release ""Let In The Sun"" is to take my career to the next level. Radio promotion and a good publicist are a must as well as professionally shot video. Thank-you to all those further down the road than I for taking the time to share their insights and contacts with me. It has helped me get a realistic idea of costs and results. The CD will be finished by the second week of Oct. and will be debuted at our Nov. 5th Bright Box Theater Show in Winchester, VA.A pre-purchase order and/or contributionwill make it possible for me to invest in taking my career to the next level and also to finish this CD - so please consider pre-purchasing one today!There are also opportunities for house concerts and lessons and more.The funds from this campaign will go directly to pay for: Mastering CD Production Website Radio Promotion Publicity VideoI can't thank-you enough dear listener for all your support and encouragement - you are the light at the end of the Music Business Tunnel - you are why folks like me love to do this! We can't do this without you nor would we want to. As we get to the final stages of recording and mixing ""Let In the Sun"" I have to give a big round of applause and appreciation for Tommy Lepson and the band: Jonathan Sloane, Sonny Petrosky and Andy Hamburger! We've been recording at Tommy Lepson's Area 51 Studio in College Park, MD. We all feel right at home at Tommy's place and it's a beautiful vibe to be marinating in while recording. His in depth musical knowledge, songwriting skills, technical skills and incredible ear have really made all the difference in the integrity of this recording - not to mention he's also singing back-ups and playing keys! We also chatted and laughed a lot - got to hear some great Root Boy Slim stories. I couldn't ask for more of a perfect guitar player than Jonathan Sloane - the man has impeccable taste, chops for miles, soul and a fantastic instinct for what really compliments a song. Sonny Petrosky - my right hand man! Besides being one of the finest, funkiest bassists you can find - he speaks my language and interprets what I mean to the rest of the band on stage and in the studio - a God Send! He also makes the songs I write better - thank-you Sonny. Andy Hamburger! There's a reason he's in demand - he's one of the best and he really cares about getting it right. Solid As A Rock. Besides being great players, these guys are also longtime, wonderful friends and I think that really comes out in the recordings. Can't wait for you to hear it!Tickets to our Brightbox show: https://www.tickettailor.com/checkout/view-event/id/66029/chk/c3aeHelp spread the word!

I do not hate men.I do not hate masculinityThe concept behind masculinity being a ""prison"" is when men reinforce the idea that men should suppress and ignore softer displays of emotions that are associated with women.#MasculinityIsAPrison is reinforcing the fear of stereotypes between men because it makes them appear too feminine or even.... not a man at all.All donations will be used to assist with the funding and press release of my first photography exhibition in New York City. My goal is to raise $10,000 and host the exhibition for my birthday (MARCH 28TH).In exchange for donating towards my exhibition, I will provide my contributors will exclusive access to my hot, new photo series entitled ""XXX"".Thank you in advance to EVERYONE willing to support another artist's dreams!

Soon we will be completing a short documentary to tell his story, and increase his mobility by getting him a wheelchair accessible van...

Opening the Finesse Center,"$9,325 ","$40,000 ",Creative," June 11, 2016",107,3,SAINT LOUIS,MO,1200,,3,"






                            Kayla Thompson
                            
                            
                                                           
SAINT LOUIS, MO                                




HOW WE GOT HEREOn June 9th, 2016, Tyrell A. Thompson was shot and killed in an attempted robbery in the Central West End. At 28, he still had a ton of living to do.Tyrell, also well known as Rell Finesse, dedicated his entire life to art and the art community. He spent every working hour and beyond perfecting his craft. For most of his life, he was the epitome of a dedicated, starving artist. Tyrell started as a student at the Art Institute of Santa Monica and later transferred to Webster University where he continued his education for 4 years. In the last year of his life, Tyrell was employed as a graphic designer at LockerDome and spent every free minute creating paintings, graphics, and drawings in his downtown loft. He was well known for his ""Power Ranger"" saga and was beginning his new ""Dragon Ball Z"" series at the time of his death. Tyrells loft was more than just his home but a creative hub for him and his friends. His famous Wall, which displayed all of his artwork, is the backdrop of countless memories and photos. A lot of people not only lost a great friend when he passed, but also found themselves without a space to gather, fellowship, and create.Kayla Thompson, Tyrells sister, founded the Finesse Center as a way to immortalize Tyrells life work as well as create a space that fosters creativity for artists and creatives just as his loft did.The Finesse Center, named in honor of the late Tyrell A. Thompson, is a co-working space designed to be a collaboration community and resource for creatives located in the heart of downtown St. Louis, Missouri.Among the biggest challenges for a creative freelance professional is finding an inspiring place to work, meet professionally with clients, as well as network and access resources.

It will be equipped with amenities such as wifi, desktop computers, printers, digital cameras, backdrops, easels, canvasses, and more all available for its dedicated members.

The Community needs your help!Orange County, CA has lost one of its greatest dance studios, Jimmie DeFore Dance Studio. DeFore was a huge part of thousands of dancers lives for 38 years. DeFore was not just another dance studio. It was a home for beginners to professionals. It was for the people of the community and for dancers just passing through. There were all genres of dance represented. It was a home away from home, a safe haven,where dancers, teachers, choreographers shared their passion for dance. Building strengths, friends, and memories. DeFore was a unique hub of the dance world.With the studio closing, not only are hundreds of dancers be displaced, but myself and some of the best dance teachers in Orange County are out of work.Something needs to happen, and happen fast!Hello, my name is Gina Cerato. AndI am searching for donations to keep the legacy, tradition, and love of dance alive in Orange County.DeFore was my home for 30 years, and now I will continue the legacy in a new and improved version. Having a studio of my own has been a continued dream, passion and goal for me. With your help I will start a new incarnation of something amazing.Following in my familys legacy (My grandmother a dancer in Hollywood, and my Aunt a Professional Ballerina) I started training right here in Orange County with Ballet Pacifica, and then with Pacific Northwest Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet. Since, I have worked with more than 25 well known choreographers as a company member with Ballet Pacifica, dancing professionally for over 20 years.Retiring from performing, I developed a passion for teaching. First at the Ballet Pacifica Conservatory, and then on to many other studios in Orange County. For over the last 10 years I have been part of the DeFore family as a faculty member, cultivating dancers that have gone on to dance professionally in many disciplines and industries. I have not only taught, but choreographed and produced as well. At DeFore I have held Summer and Winter Intensives, and most recently a Variations workshop. Just last year, I spent time in New York City with my brother (A Broadway dancer) while attending ABTs National Training Curriculum and becoming an ABT certified teacher.Now, here I am starting from scratch to create a NEW Orange County studio in the tradition, style, similar location of DeFore, only better. An open, drop in, adult, beginning to professional studio. All dance styles, with performance opportunities, a strong faculty( at least 16 confirmed from DeFore), and a conservatory separate from the adults, with a foundation of strong technique for the next generation.I am truly appreciative of any and all donations. Every $10, $100, $1000 will go toward the new studio for the new location, sprung Marley floors, mirrors, stereo systems, barres, computer, cash register, phone system, advertising, refrigerator, etc. I am also in need of funds for the permits and insurance specifically for a dance studio.I look forward to presenting this new studio very soon to our community and continuing the legacy and tradition of Dance in Orange County.This can only happen from the love and support of all. Please forward this to any and all dance enthusiasts, friends, family, and supporters.Thanks and Keep Dancing!!!

                                                Hello, my name is Derrick Bell Perez and I am a filmmaker who is seeking the opportunity to tell an extraordinary story. Let me introduce you to my best friend Queena. She was a bubbly, free-spirited, intelligent senior attending East Bay High School with a bright future ahead of her. While returning her books at the library she was brutally assaulted and left for dead. Since the tragic event, Queena has lost the ability to walk, speak, or move, blessings that most people take for granted. Some may know her as the Bloomingdale Library Victim, but I see her as the Bloomingdale Library Survivor. Queena has not given up on life.  She has been pulling through and fighting her hardest to recover. She has fought daily to move again and gain back the life that was once said she would never have again. Queena has an amazing inspiring story to tell and has asked me to share it with the world. In order for my partner/mentor/brother, Ryan Brison and I to bring this movie to life, we are in need of funding in order to cover: camera, equipment, food, costumes, makeup and post production costs. We are looking to begin filming in the middle of October.  Being a survivor of abuse myself, I take this film to the heart. I am truly inspired at the fact that regardless of what has happened to Queena and what she has lost, she still has that beautiful contagious smile on her face. We are very thankful to any and all sponsors for wanting to be a part of this awesome journey to which we are about to embark on.

We are a group of hard working guys who bust their butts working back breaking jobs during the day so that wecan write and perform the music welove at night! We think we found a special pop/rock sound that has tremendous mass appeal.We have dropped every penny we have into this project and we just cannot do this anymore on our own. For us this is do or die! We think we were put on this earth to make YOU music and if we don't get your help, we can't afford take it to the next level. Check us out and decide for your self whether we are worth it, and help us keep our dream alive!Push Phonic EP On Itunes Push Phonic brings intense,fun, & inspiring music to the masses. It's our hope that we help our fans let loose and remember to just have fun!Your support will allow us to record our next album and get it the exposure we need to bring it to you.Who We Are Meet a brand new band with a familiar sound all their own. Push Phonic is a pop band fronted by Season 11 American Idol finalist Creighton Fraker. Recognized by the judges, Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler & Randy Jackson for his unique and remarkable voice and style, he left his mark with a rendition of Wonderful World that rivals the best youve ever heard.Creighton went on to make it into Idols top finalists, and upon his elimination would go on to tour the world with American Idol for the next year bringing some familiarity to our military soldiers around the world. As the tour came to an end Creighton came back in NYC to look for a way to make ends meet. South Dakota born and raised by his adopted family when he was a baby, Creighton now found himself back at the beginning, contemplating what to do with his life while cramped in his tiny NYC apartment. As to be expected the thrill of the Idol whirlwind, the high of a lifetime, left him with a crash just as extreme.Creighton is a quiet and mysterious guy. His look can be deceiving, with a distinctly sharp and masculine face, and deep dark heavy eyes, you might not expect him to be kind, careful, considerate, gentle and for certain SHY. Once his nerves settle a bit he begins to let you see him. Funny, sarcastic, smart, and incredibly talented. An adopted son of a preacher man, he received the bulk of his training singing in church beginning when he was 5 years old.Ask directly and he will easily share intimate details of his unique life with you. When he was 18 he hunted down his biological mother who he eventually finds is living in Nebraska. Several months after he discovered where she was living he picks up the phone and tells her, Hey I am your biological son, and I will be in town in a few days, do you want to meet up?"" ""It was so awkward, he says, but everything about her was just like me! Meeting her was like looking into a mirror at myself and then it just kinda all made sense. She looked like me, she talked like me, she moved like me. It was like we were almost the same person! He then discovers that his biological father, who would later be by his side throughout his journey on American Idol, is an established musician in his own right, Eric A.K. Knutson front man for the 80s Heavy metal band FLOTSAM AND JETSAM. In an interview taken from American Idol Creighton said ""I was adopted when I was just a little baby and I grew up as a preacher's kid, singing church music. And then, I always had this rock and roll thing going on in me and it was kind of out of nowhere. Come to find out my birth father, who I never even knew until I was, like, 25 years old, was the lead singer of this big heavy metal band called FLOTSAM AND JETSAM . I meet my dad and I'm like 'Oh, I get it! It all makes sense now. Across town while Creighton was wrapping up his Idol tour, native new yorkers and identical twin brothers Gabriel and Lyon Orpaz were struggling to find their way too. Having auditioned for Sony records the feedback was, You have impressive song writing ability, but are not quite ready yet. Just as both Creighton and the Orpaz boys were about to give up forever, it was the intervention of a therapist, who was sick of listening to Creighton complain about not having the right band, and Gabriel complaining about not finding the right lead signer respectively, that she decided to bring them together. Moments before Push Phonic was to be born, waiting in the studio for the auditions to begin, Gabriel turned to his brother Lyon and says, If this next guy doesnt work out. I am done. I am quitting music forever! In walks Creighton.As tragedy will sometimes have it, it was the unrelated decision of a total stranger JV Vidopio , lead guitar player of Hypodive, to separate from his band that would eventually change the fate of these guys forever. JV, a successful NYC guitar player, decided to respond to an ad for rhythm playing/back up singer and he ended up being a perfect asset to the team.The final piece came together when band found their way to Kendal Lantz, an accomplished and energetic drummer.Something magical happens when we all get together. We just know, ya know? says lead guitar player Gabriel Orpaz.With all 5 boys having recently experienced great challenges, their collective decision was to make music that was fun, powerful, and inspiring! Together a unique style of songwriting and musicianship deliberately informed by heartache and the desperate desire to escape into something fun, exciting, and empowering was born.So who is Push Phonic? When asked how they chose their name Creighton smiles and says, Well that's easy. Our goal is to push the boundaries of sound. PUSH PHONIC!""

                        My brother and I are involved in the Winter Percussion program at Clovis High. Winter Percussion is an indoor drumline ensemble that consists of the marching percussion and front ensemble (pit). My brother and I were fortunate enough to make the ""World Line"", which consists of the most advanced performers,and have been Valley Champions for the past 3 years. It is an honor to be a part of something so important and reallyexciting! We have the opportunity to go to World Championships in Dayton, OH in April to compete against other World Line teams from 40 states and 4 countries. This is a pretty BIG deal, but costs money. Money that our Winter Percussionprogram cannot afford to front for all 33 members, our instructors, and chaperones. So each of us are responsible for paying our own way. The cost to go per person is $1600, which doesn't include the cost for uniforms and the total fee of Winter Percussion itself. Please help us in this once in a lifetime opportunity to perform in front of thousands of people in Dayton, OH. We have been doing our best to fundraise by selling pies, candy and coupon books, but it isn't enough. If you would like to help Kaleb and me continue to grow in our passion for music and the arts, please do so by donating here. We really appreciate all of your continued love and support for us, and thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

                        In the Spring of 2015, 17 dancers and dance faculty from Beijing Normal University (BNU) of Beijing, China traveled half way across the globe, to the University of South Florida (USF), to participate in a week of cultural trade and artistic collaboration. Unbeknownst to us, one week was all it took to witness the promising beginnings of a greater exchange program...and to change our lives forever. Now, 14 of us within the USF dance program have been invited to attend a highly prestigious International Dance Festival at BNU from October 2-14, 2015. Foremost, this is an extrodinary educational, cultural, and artistic opportunity. During the festival, we will work with some of the most prominent choreographers and teachers in China as well as from other countries internationally. We will perform in choreographic works that will premiere in China in a world forum, participate in Traditional Chinese Classical dance classes and other world dance styles, meet dancers from around the world, engage in seminars regarding the furture of arts education, serve as ambassadors from the USA, foster international relationships between USF and BNU, and continue to forge an artistic community that bridges USA and China relations in an ongoing manner. Not only will this time abroad help to launch our careers by providing us with invaluable professional international experience, this experience will foster our potential to be life-long universal liasons and grow our appreciation of global advocacy.Once we are in China, we will have all expenses paid for (including lodging, food, ground transportation and personal translators). However, we need to GET there! Therefore, we are in need of funding for airfare in order to fulfill this dream. It will require about $15,000.00 to make this trip possible for the 14 of us. Please consider supporting us in this momentous endeavor. Every cent counts. Thank you!

Please consider investing in thw further discipline and growth of her art that has blessed so many with a glimpse of that beauty.Gracie has been blessed to receive amazing instruction at SC Christian Dance Theatre for nearly nine years now. This summer she turns 17, and all the questions of what is next have come to the forefront. After much prayer and consideration her hope is to eventually join Ballet Magnificat. Cynthia, the owner of SCCDT and long time teacher has suggested that if Gracie is serious about pursuing such a dance career that she needs to go to a solid summer intensive to get exposure to other teachers. It just so happens that one great summer intensive programs happens right here in Columbia, SC at USC.We just found out that Grace was accepted, and we are excited. But her acceptance letter was originally lost in the mail and the tuition is already past due, so we literally have days to raise $1550 for tuition. The remainder of our stated goal is to cover all the new shoes, accessories, and incidentals that the intensive will require.

The World They Left Us - Short Film,"$1,035 ","$1,000 ",Creative," March 9, 2016",14,6,Sydney,Australia,58000,,1,"

Sydney, Australia                                




Hey friends,

Thank you for your interest in our not-so-little project!

We are currently in post-production for our short film, and we need your help to get it finished! 'The World They Left Us' is a dystopian drama that follows a group of survivors as they flee a broken and violent system, searching for a safe place beyond the vast wilderness. But safety is an illusion amongst the desperate, and it forces the question -what lengths would you go to, to survive?



ABOUT US.

We are a group of five acting and filmmaking students in our final year at the International Screen Academy in Sydney. With all of us focusing on acting, our training has enabled us to each develop our own skill set along the way in terms of creating our own work, telling stories we feel are important, and making beautiful stuff for all of your eyeballs. Some of us are also writers, directors, editors, design extrodinaires. Mid-way through 2015, we were tasked with the challenge of seeing a film project through from its conception, as the bare bones of an idea, through a competitive pitch process, 5-weeks of intensive script development, then pre- production and making big artistic decisions about the look, sound, texture and overall story that we wanted to create. We then filmed it, both acting in and directing our project, all the while feeding and caffeinating the small army of hungry talent that helped us get through it all.

ABOUT THE FILM.

In a near-future Dystopia, a disparate group of survivors flee from a violent State that's falling apart, pushing through the wildernesson the vague promise of a safe place somewhere beyond the vastness. They stumble upon an abandoned shed, a brief moment of respite, and a chance to scouer the place for anything of value. But when hidden truths are revealed and their current course threatened, these five people will be brought to the brink and forced to stare down their own mortaility. At what cost comessurvival? And when is it no longer worth it?

The film is gritty, raw, visually sumptuous and emotionally confronting. It shines a light on the dark corners of humanity in times of desperation, and forces the question of what you are willing to live and die for, and what's still matters when you have nothing left but yourself.

GETTING THE FILM MADE &HOW THE MONEY WILL BE USED.As filmmakers, we've made it quite a long way into our journey already! The funds that we started with have allowed us to pull together a dynamic week of filming with an incredible arsenal of talent in our cast and crew. It's now safely in the can and has reached the editing suite in one piece (or, to be precise, very many pieces!)

We're now tasked will the enormous process of post-production - editing the film, grading, mixing, enlisting a composer to create the score we imagine, and bringing it to life. We're not content with making your standard student film. We care deeply about this project as the culmination of two and a half years full time training from all of us. We want to be able to see this film through a life of its own,share this story withas many people as possible, and show the industry what we can do! The vision we have for this project is one of strength and beauty, and achieving this requires high production values.

This part we do need help with - a little extra money to pay for a professional colour grader (which ain't cheap!) and to get it looking, sounding and feeling the way we want will help us turn this project into something really special to share with all of you.If there is any left over from the pool that we raise after post-production services have been paid for, the remainder will go tocovering some additional costs the team had to bear to get the film made and everybodyfed! 



EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS.

Whether it's $5 or $50, every little bit that you donate will help us get one step closer to where we need to be. This project, by the time it's completed in the next few months, represents a year of hard work from all of us, as well as countless tears, hours locked in meeting rooms,artistic debates, dinners eaten at laptops, late nights in rehearsal rooms, trips to Vinnies, trips to Bunnings and many early mornings location scouting. We want to create something incredible out of all of this, and with your help, we might do just that!

If you're able to help us out with any donation - big or small - or even just share it around to help this campaign and film gain traction, we would be incredibly grateful. We cannot make the film we want without a little extra push over the finish line. And we appreciate every bit of support we can get!



THANK YOU!

(Campaign costs, festival and deadline info are located at the bottom)The announcement was made one last time: anyone who wants to be placed in the music program, please come down to the auditorium. This will be the last call. I looked down at my homework, to my teacher, and then to the kids I knew would ridicule me for playing the violin, and they did. But something in me told me not to care, and I made a decision that would change my life forever.9 years later Im in college, playing with the USF Symphony Orchestra, third chair, second violin, studying under the wonderful Carolyn Stuartsomething I never thought Id have the talent to do. I was always told I couldnt, but now Ive been accepted into the Green Mountain Music Festival attended by just 165 students from all over the world. But as it is with everything, there is just one thing getting in the way: money. This is where you come in.Green Mountain is an opportunity to jumpstart my career; I will be participating in a month-long intensive of non-stop performance, lessons, and masterclasses from renowned musicians. I will be put on a rigorous schedule, where half of the day will be dedicated to practicing and ensemble rehearsal, and the other half to attending/performing masterclasses, and attending/performing concerts. I want to pay for this exhausting schedule because it will impact my career like nothing else ever has before, and I am depending on you to help me get there. Any, any help at all will be greatly appreciated!All money will be going towards festival costs (aside from scholarship)and airfare. All money made outside of GoFundMe for this campaign will be added to the goal, and I plan to keep everyone updated every step of the way.Thank you so much!(Deadline #1 for the first festival payment is May 1st, $1290. Deadline #2 for festival payment is June 1st, $2090 )(Goal includes $4180 festival cost, -$800 scholarship, +$400 airfare, + 7.9% GoFundMe fee and their additonal take of 30 cents per donation)(Green Mountain Website:  https://gmcmf.org/)

                        Dear friends, family, universe,I am making this GoFundMe for something I want, not something Ineed. I want to be a musician. I want to change people's lives through music. I want to do thisfor the rest of my life.An unfortunate part of my plan happens to be the way I want to make music. I plan to continue making music withthe tuba. I fell in love with the gentle beast 13 years ago and have been playing ever since. Just to be clear: there's nothing unfortunate about the tuba. What's unfortunate happens to bethe price.The tuba that I am looking to buy is a compliment to the horn I already have. I know it sounds crazy to wanttwoof something so expensive, however,it has become almost standard to perform on two different kinds of tubas. I am inwant of aBass Tuba. I have $3500 saved up, and the tuba I am looking to buy will cost around$9500.I'm not trying to beg. I'm not going to plead. I even would not be enraged if I didn't receive a dime through generosity. I would, however, be verythankful. I attend my firstgraduate school audition tomorrow, and I finish my other three later this month. If I knew that I had this instrument to continue my studies, I would be in a much more comfortable place in my career.THANK YOUin advance for even taking the time to read this! If you can and want to and do help, I won't forget it. And if you can't or don't want to, or just don't help, that's great too!

LOS ANGELES, CA                                




""Princess Rose and the Misfit Cave""Runtime:5-6minutesLogline:When six-year-old Annabelle casts her autistic teen sister Sorina in her newest fantasy play, the lines between make-believe and real life become blurred. Annabelle's character ""Princess Rose"" struggles with isolation in ways strangely similar to the painful social anxiety her disabled sister faces daily. When fiction and reality collide, Annabelle must decide between saving the play and comforting her sister. Shoot dates: November 7/8 and 13/14Expected release date: December2016Writer/Director:Emma BradfordCinematographer/Editor:Giuliano MusacchioProducer/Sound: Nicole FalsettiDear Friends and Family,In August I will officially enter into my junior year at USC! During the first semester I will be enrolled in CTPR310  aka my junior thesis production class. Last semester I worked tirelessly on a script that I am very passionate about, entitled Princess Rose and the Misfit Cave. This script is extremely close to my heart. It deals with issues of mental illness and growing up.I have drawn inspiration from my childhood self, my complicated relationship with my sister, and all of the children who have made an impact on my life over the past few summers as a camp counselor at Park Terrace! I cannot wait to work with kids on the set of this film. Which brings me to my next point...For the class, I have a maximum budget of $1,000 (that I must raise myself) for my short film. Casting children actors (anyone under the age of 18), means that I will need to hire a studio teacher to supervise the children on set. Unfortunately studio teachers, on average, cost a whopping $250 per day. With a four-day shoot schedule, this means that my entire budget will go towards the studio teacher! That means that I will have $0 for food, locations, and set decorations. I will be working hard throughout the summer to find restaurants and grocery stores willing to donate food for the cast and crew, any LA families who are willing to give up their living room for a few days of shooting, and pestering my parents to ship me art supplies and home dcor from the depths of our basement and garage so that I will not have to spend a penny over the budget to make this film possible! I have two internships and am working three jobs this summer to work on funding my film, but Im a college student in Los Angeles with plenty of my own personal costs, so I cant fund this film on my own! ANY AMOUNT YOU CAN GIVE WILL BE A HUGE HELP! Whether its $10, $25, $50, or $100. INCENTIVES:$25 will get you a huge hug and high five from yours truly.$50 will get you a personalized Thank You card from the star characters of the film- Annabelle and Sorina.$150+ will get you all of the above PLUS an Executive Producer credit on the film  so you can watch your lovely name scroll across the screen! Thank you so much for reading and donating  I cant wait to make this script a reality.Cheers!Emma

In July 2013 Charles Dumas, his wife Magali, and Xavier LaFonte, Director of International Studies for Apprentis D'Auteuil came to visit the Don't Miss A Beat facilities to see our Music & Art Summer Camp in action. Their trip was beyond a success, and from this amazing venture, we were chosen as a U.S. Partner to establish cross cultural collaborative efforts to benefit children at risk.I was then introduced to a third organization in Togo West Africa called Vivre Dans L' Esperance, whose mission is to shelter children who have lost their parents to AIDS. Xavier LaFonte had just visited this organization before he came to Jacksonville, FL and felt that it would be a perfect fit to have Don't Miss A Beat, Apprentis D'Auteuil and Vivre Dans L'Esperance participate in a cultural collaboration. At that point we decided that we would take 12 children from each organization and unite them for two events, in Paris and in Jacksonville, to culminate both of our Music and Art summer camps that share the same vision. With your help, we can complete the fundraising process for the additional money that is still needed to purchase our airfare. We have already secured funding to purchase passports for our children at DMAB, we also have partners, ""Riverside Dental"", who were so generous in purchasing luggage for the children, and Microsoft who has graciously agreed to donate brand new Surface Tablets for our children so that they can document the trip as well as Skype and communicate with their families while they are in Paris. Anything you can give towards this unbelievable mission and purpose that we know we have been destined to fulfill will be greatly appreciated and we know in return, as you are providing an opportunity to a child, the same will happen for you in your life according to your specific need. Our Mission at Don't Miss A Beat is to Inspire, Engage, Connect, and Nurture by utilizing the Arts as a Bridge to a better life. Thanks in advance for assisting us with our vision.

                        Thornton Study Abroad LONDON PROGRAMJuly 15 to July 26 (+ 2-day Glasgow extension) 2016 MUSC-470 Contemporary Popular Music  A Global PerspectiveWhats going on?Summer is here, and how about those summer vibes? Ive been given the opportunity to study abroad through Thorntons Study Abroad - London Program! Students will tour the center of England, experiencing a ten-day music intensive while interacting and networking with other student/faculty musicians from The Institute Of Contemporary Music Performance (ICMP). With projects aimed towards popular music performance, production and culture, we strive to learn about popular styles as we explore song writing, rehearsal and performance strategies, stage presence, and collaboration in an international setting. Through this curriculum, both my analytical and directing skills will be challenged, allowing me to hone my ability to creatively and successfully combine distinct musical components. As I surround myself with talented-minded musicians, the program fosters a community in which young Londoners are encouraged to create, without fear of judgment, proving to be a genuine space for learning. This will prepare me for my ultimate endeavor of launching a record label, a label that fosters good music from unique, and even international, experiences.Why London?Why not? Next to Los Angeles, London is considered to be one of the most exciting places for music; acting as a hotbed for underground artists and small independent labels. Here lives one of the most creative times that British music has ever seen, heaving with young artists that refuse conventional wisdom and style with talent, humor and truth. Its freedom of speech! The UK is giving more opportunities to niche artists and niche sounds, and Im eager to explore it. As theyre considered to have a vibrant underground scene, there are hundreds of new artists to fall in love with in the capital; also meaning there are hundreds of collaborative opportunities and musical experiences! Details:Students participate in a 10-day intensive course in the study, composition, production, marketing and performance of original, contemporary popular music, with an emphasis on the London music scene. This may include the London Eye, West-End shows, Abbey Road Studios, the British Museum, various theaters and music pubs, parks and historic monuments and Liverpool.The London Program will be hosted from July 15 to July 26; the Glascow ICMP conference performance and experience will add the July 27 performance and the July 28 return to London.We will be hosted through ACCENT International Consortium for Academic Programs Abroad  www.accentintl.com. They will provide:1. Modern dormitory housing with study rooms, internet access, kitchen, concierge, tours2. Free ground transportation in London provided via rail passICMP students and faculty will collaborate with Thornton students on the production of several performances and recordings of original music throughout London. Past classes have performed at a variety of venues and participated in worldwide pod casts from The Regal Rooms, Paradise and Bedford Theaters  three of the top songwriter showcase venues in London. The 2014 class performed at 5 venues in 10 days, and spent a full day of recording at the SRR studios, London!For more information, videos, pictures:Face book: https://www.facebook.com/groups/132726490093804/?fref=tsICMP: https://www.dropbox.com/s/r9piwtjz0g7zs8u/showreel_110912_1280x720.mp4Article: http://music.usc.edu/students-find-their-pop-personas-abroad/Lecture/workshops have included: Jason Guy - Director of marketing - EMI, UK Sophie Daniels  Head of Songwriting, ICMP Richard Niles - Song writing (Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Sting) Tollis Zavalialis - Greek fusion composition, recording Eliza Keys, Vic Bynoe - Stage techniques and deportment Jay Stapely  Music Licensing, intellectual propertyStudent expenses, Summer 2016Undergrad Unit rate Tuition: 2 units     $3332London Music Program ACCENT housing/ground-transport $1610 Student Health Insurance             $80  (approx.)Airfare (round trip)                      $1500 (approx.)Miscellaneous                             $500 (approx.)Total                                     $7022 (approx.)What can we do?This is a great opportunity to learn, network, and experience music in a different environment; I just dont have the funds to support the trip. As you know, college units are expensive, and a plane ticket out of the country isnt cheap either. In a perfect world, money would never decide whether or not were allowed to experience the world; but weve got to give a couple nickels and dimes. Therefore, I kindly ask for any donation towards this dream of traveling out of the country to experience music, especially in London! Any donation is greatly appreciated, even if it was just a penny, for thats a penny I didnt have before. In London Ill strive to play, write, learn, and explore, developing my craft with valued international exposure.

The Warning Band's first album,"$20,630 ","$20,000 ",Creative," April 12, 2016",180,5,ROUND ROCK,TX,16000,11,7,"






                            Luis Villarreal
                            
                            
                                                           
ROUND ROCK, TX                                





                        Hello everyone! This is Dany, Pau, and Ale from THE WARNING. We are super excited that we completed writing music and lyrics of all the songs for our first full album. We have been working very hard on them every day since last December, and we have put our heart and soul into them and we think you guys are going to be proud of them. Last week we started recording drums for the album with the help of some of our musician friends who have loaned us the gear and the place to do it, and of course with the support of our parents. We are so happy with the progress, of course with ups and downs with sweat, blisters, eye bags and even sacrificing school hours, yet feeling proud of our work after spending long hours in the studio.To take the next step on recording an independent LP (because we decided to not sign with any label) we need your help and support. We decided to go independent because we believe in and love what we do and we wouldn't settle for what some labels thought would sell more, like radio friendly time songs or changing lyrics, changing our image to a tougher one (all dress in black with painted hair), or even making our songs more commercial and danceable. So, we had some offers (and we are grateful for them, we feel blessed) but we are who we are and we do what we do, and that is what we want to transmit with our music, even if it's not considered a good business for the labels. We want to stay true to ourselves and respect what we do, not selling ourselves to that.Thanks to your generosity we got to study last summer at the Berklee College of Music. We learned a lot, we had a wonderful time and it was the opportunity of a lifetime. Now we ask once again for your support. We need your help to finish this album because it costs a lot doing it independently and we dont want to settle for a low quality recording. We want to do a great album, well produced and an album that sounds amazing, that is why we are reaching again for your help so we can make this a reality.Our dear friend Nick Warring from Austin, TX is offering his free time (he is a great Fireman) to help us with this campaign so we can concentrate in doing a great album for all of you. We are grateful to having him on board making sure you get the latest updates on how things are going with us at the studio.Thanks for all your support and God bless you all.Sincerely,The WarningDany, Pau, and Ale I'm very happy to help. Everyone, my name is Nick Warring. Like you I'm a fan of the Warning Band, and I'm a friend of the Villarreal family. I wanted to help this fundraising effort because of how exceptional these girls are. If you're here reading this you've undoubtedly been entertained by the great talents of Dany, Pau, and Ale either by a video or live performance which they do expertly and very powerfully. Equally as impressive to me is just how hard these girls work, and how they along with their parents are such genuinely good people. With the work ethic and character they possess in addition to their talents they deserve a chance to record their first album. I'm very proud of them for staying true to themselves and recording independently. For such young girls they have a very strong sense of who they are and what they want their music to be. The only way to maintain their creative freedom was to record independently. That comes at a high price though as studio time, producer time, and other production and post production costs are great. The Villarreal family is sacrificing greatly to try to accomplish this but it is very difficult. So, let's help the Warning Band make their first album the way it should be made, by them!The girls and the family are so busy I'll be helping them by posting occasional updates here to keep you all up to date on the album's progress. We should also get to see some photos andhopefully short videos of the girls at work. I'm looking forward to the progress and to a great album!

The Traveling Piano Success Fund!,"$10,271 ","$25,000 ",Creative," December 13, 2015",151,9,PHILADELPHIA,PA,4300,1,166,"

PHILADELPHIA, PA                                





                        Hello!I am a piano man with a piano dog named Mo! We have a piano on the back of a shiny red pickup truck and it is called the Traveling Piano. Mo hangs out with me on top of the piano. We enjoy the idea of strangers becoming less afraid of each other. This happens through music and the sharing of the Traveling Piano seat with everyone we meet. We have been sharing the music of life with a passion that endures! We do not look to find people they find us. It can happen in the woods, on a busy street, at the beach or in a grocery store parking lot. Our connections are all synchronistic and spontaneous. Nothing is scheduled. We create one-on-one relationships with people everywhere. We have traveled to the North Pole, to the most eastern tip of Newfoundland and to the south of Mexico as well as to the Florida Keys. No money is involved. We work without fees, tips or solicitation of any kind and have no commercial, organizational or political affiliation. Our journey has now been happening for ten years as of February 16, 2016. It is called the Traveling Piano's ""Flight of Peregrinating Musical Exploration!"" I have worked full time with a piano on the back of the same pickup truck for almost thirty years. The first twenty years was as a paid performer. Now, I do not perform or entertain. My music is shared freely. It is improvisational and from my soul. There is nothing I enjoy more than showing everyone how to create music as I do. One single musical note can be enough to change a life forever. Along with my pup Mo, we have been able to touch the lives of over 50,000 individual people through personal one-on-one musical interactions. The Traveling Piano has been in just about every environment imaginable and with people from all walks of life. We have been able to spend time to help keep spirit alive where tragic events have happened. As well as in conventional situations, the Traveling Piano has spent time in communities affected by both Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. We were in Joplin, Missouri after a tornado destroyed much of the city and in Sandy Hook, Connecticut 2012 as well as with the students of Virginia Tech after the mass shooting there. The visit in Virginia Tech was at the request of the student government. During 2015, we spent a couple weeks on skid row in Los Angeles as well as in San Diego and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with the Traveling Piano. Every day since 2006 has been blogged with writing, pictures and music on the Traveling Piano website. We need your help. My work out on the road is slowing down. Funds are needed in order to continue. My present goal is to raise $25,000 in contribution to not only celebrate ten full years of the Traveling Piano but also, now at age sixty and without a home for many years, I feel a need to establish a home base to work from. In 2017 if blessed enough, piano dog Mo and hopefully you along for the ride in spirit... we will all be able to have a 30 year celebration of music having been created from the back of the same truck with a piano in it... still going since 1987! 90% of funding until now has come out of pocket from the sale of my home and personal belongings. Also, Mo and I have stayed with over a hundred and fifty different people in their homes throughout the last ten years. How often in life does a person meet a stranger willing to share their life with a pure desire to empower and inspire and with no agenda except for happiness. I love that and piano dog Mo loves everything! We are out to create joy, to lift spirit with validation and reassurance through music. The world needs more of the Traveling Piano! Please help us continue to pay forward the gratitude of what life is really about Fun, Friendship and Respect!Update August 2016: We are about out of funding. The money raised to date has floated us since December 2015, barely enough to survive on. With present day cost of living expenses along with the complications of having had no income or proof of residency for over ten years... Mo and I will be homeless and without resources without more support. Keep us going!

Dubrek Studios Flood Fund,,,Creative," August 24, 2016",165,1,Arboretum Ward,ENG,774000,,3,"

Over the last 12 months, JayDean and his partner VickyDel-Greco have spent all theirwaking hours ripping out walls, building new ones, wiring, painting,decorating, soundproofing (etc etc..) an empty propertyon Becket Street in Derby. All of this work has beenundertaken with amazing dedication in orderto open up the next incarnation of Dubrek Studios - a rehearsal room, recording studio and venue/cafe. This has been a project filled with passion, hard work and many, many 15-20 hour days. An opening night celebration was due to take place in September.Unfortunately, on 20th August heavy flooding took place at the studiocaused bytorrential rain leaking through the lower floor's roof - resulting in thousands of pounds worth of damage. This flooding was the result of repair work being carried out onthe roof by external contractors who neglected to properly secure the roof when they vacated for the weekend.Thankfully a few awesome, lovely people were on hand at the time to quickly move a lot of band equipment out of the way, butthere has still been substantial property damage. This means that rehearsal rooms and a large portion of the building are completely out of action at present, and will need signficant repair work before they can be used again.Some of the areas which are damaged beyond repair are listed here:Wooden flooring Carpets & underlayLino flooringWooden sub-floor structuresSkirting boardsElectrical wiringPlasterboard wallsAcoustic treatmentSofas and other furnitureThis is a devastatingblow for Jay and Vicky, who havepoured all theirtime, money and effort into something that has been of great benefit to a large part of the Derby music & arts community for a long time. Jay himself has been at this since 2002,when the very first Dubrek opened,and it's all been building up to the work that has brought us this new studio. A lot ofbands in Derby - not to mention scores of others from across the UK - have at one time or another either recorded at Dubrek or used the rehearsal rooms, and a whole heapof us wouldn't have been able to do the things that we love without Dubrekand everything they'veaccomplished over the years.While an insurance claim against the roofing contractorsmay eventually cover some of the work that needs to be done, the studio lives and dies by the people thatuse it. And currently, they can't. Any insurance claim is likely to take a lot of time, and there is no certainty around what kind of settlement will eventually be reached, if at all.We have started this page on behalf ofJay & Vicky to help them make the essential repairs needed to keep the studio running - before it's too late. Any money raisedwill help pay forreplacing damaged flooring, laying new carpets and underlay, replacing ruined furniture, electrical work, painting, plastering and decorating, amongst many other things that will need to be done in order to get the studio back up to speed and open again.If we're lucky enough to raise more than the target, it will all be ploughed into further improvements to the facilities.Jay & Vicky feel extremelyuncomfortable asking for financial assistance, which is why we're asking on theirbehalf. Dubrek is something that has been vital to the community in Derby, and has benefited so many people for nearly 15 years. Now we're hoping that we cando a little something to helpkeep the place going for many more years to come, sobands can continue to come to Dubrek Studios to record, rehearse and make noise.

                        My name is Nicole Kurtz, and I have just begun the Fall quarter of my junior year at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). As an Industrial Design major, I am learning many new things about the power of innovation, and how I can use my abilities as an artist to contribute to the world. This year, I have been continuing to improve my illustration skills, as well as taking classes in Graphic design. I have been looking forward to new academic adventures in my 2016 course load. In fact, I have recently been invited by one of my professors to join a small selected group of designstudents, as well asprofessional designersin an amazing opportunity this winter. From December 411th, I have been invited to join an organization called Project Resound on a social design trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  http://projectresound.com/Project Resound was founded on the belief that artists and designers are called to serve, support and assist in the promotion of beauty, love and justice. It is open to anyone who is passionate about using their creative skills to make a positive difference in the world.     This organization aims to carry out short-term projects that:  Promote cross-cultural exchange and multi-disciplinary collaboration  Provide exciting opportunities to employ our talents in the service of others  Inspire an atmosphere of teamwork, fun and friendship  Prove that extraordinary things can be accomplished with ordinary resources While on the trip, I will assist in offering design workshops to students and small business owners in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We will also be conducting RAD projects (Random Acts of Design), where we create something beautiful for someone and surprise them with it before we leavelast year, participants designed a logo for an entrepreneur who owned a small storehe loved it! I am excited about this opportunity to collaborate with other designers, and to share my talents and skills with those less fortunate than myself. In order for this trip to be possible, I am responsible to raise $2000 before November. This includes my flight, ground transportation, food, lodging, travel health insurance, and interpretative services. My goal is to raise some of the money necessary to go to Rio through your sponsorship.    As a designer, I want to bring change to the world. I know that visual art can go on to inspire for generations and can even spark further innovation. This opportunity to join Project Resound will be a challenge, that I am able and ready to take on. I am ready to inspire and be inspired. As the Project Resound illustrator I will be able to help small businesses expand their network, and use visual art to enhance their brand. The ability to immerse myself in a community and go on to help using design, which is what I love doing the most, is a once in a lifetime chance. If you would be willing to help sponsor me financially, any donations will be greatly appreciated.  I will be sure to update you all on the success of this project. Thank you all for your love and support! Sincerely, Nicole Kurtz

SAN FRANCISCO, CA                                





I am Atsuko Morita. I am one in a diminishing group of photographers still working with traditional photography. Just as there is a quality difference between music recorded on LP records and music recorded on compressed CDs, just as there is a difference between handmade sweaters and mass-produced, machine-made sweaters, there is a difference between digital photography and film photography. For this reason, keeping traditional photography alive means so much to me. Fewer and fewer universities are teaching traditional photography. As a result, demand for classic photography is decreasing, many films are being discontinued, and we are losing traditional techniques. I believe that current photography builds off these traditional techniques. To lose touch with these original, analog techniques is to lose touch with our photographic identity. Digital photography and ink jet printers are important staples of photography, but I believe digital and traditional photography should co-exist, side by side, each complimenting the other. We can't let the original photographic processes die. We can keep film alive by shooting film, exhibiting darkroom prints and teaching traditional photography to the next generation. I have been producing projects for years using traditional film photography. In addition, I have made my own pinhole cameras (camera obscure) for many of my projects. With the exposed film, I use traditional darkroom techniques to print my photographs. I choose to spend my time and energy photographing and printing this way because the results are beautiful continuous tone color (chromogenic) prints. There is an elegant preciousness to traditional photography because analog mimics life.I have earned a coveted opportunity to print my latest series, titled 365, in the labs at Rayko Photo Center in San Francisco. I need your help to ready the series for exhibition. This campaign will raise the funds necessary to print, mount, and frame 24 large format (30""x40"") prints.365is now over two years in the making. Using a pinhole camera I crafted specificallyfor this project, I have captured one moment from each day in my life.The photos are clustered by month, with a small portion of the negative exposed for each calendar day.With your support you will both help me finally finish a long, ongoing project and keep traditional photography alive!Atsuko Morita: Project 365POSTED ON 2016-09-16 - BY ANN JASTRABAtsuko Morita: Project 365 POSTED ON 2016-09-16 - BY ANN JASTRAB Biography of Atsuko MoritaBORN     1972, Osaka, Japan EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS2010    Academy of Art University, San Francisco, CA,Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree2008    Crown Point Press, San Francisco, CA,Photogravure Workshop2003     Kyoto University of Art and Design, Kyoto, Japan,Advanced Gelatin Silver WorkshopEXHIBITIONS2015-2016  Photoplace Gallery, Middlebury, VT,Alternative Camera: Pinholes to Plastic, Juried Exhibition2014         Sue Tallon Photography Studio, San Francisco, CA,Art to Benefit AIDS LIFECYCLE2013-2014  RayKo Photo Center, San Francisco, CA,Crafted at Rayko, Group Exhibition2013         RayKo Photo Center, San Francisco, CA,4th Annual Juried Pinhole Show, Honorable mention2013          SOMArts Cultural Center, San Francisco, CA,DIAL COLLECT/Residency Exhibition2012          Nodo Galeria, Tijuana, B.C, Mexico,Nueva Alternativa/EYE 94 Group Exhibition2012          Book & job Gallery, San Francisco, CA, Dust Mag #3 Exhibition/Group Exhibition2012          Make Hang Art Gallery, San Francisco, CA,Everything Changes/ Duo Exhibition2011           Cabrillo Gallery, Aptos, CA,TASTY/ Juried exhibition2011           Southern Exposure, San Francisco,CA, PROOF/ Juried exhibition2011  Space Gallery, San Francisco, CA,A Trace of Evidence/EYE94 Group Exhibition2011 The Center for Fine Art Photography,  Fort Collins, CO, Food/International juried exhibition2011 Rayko Photo Center, San Francisco, CA, Open Show #13, Cells/Featured presenter2011  Space Gallery, San Francisco, CA ,Hope/Group Exhibition/Organizer2011 410 Gallery, San Francisco, CA,Cosmos, Solo Exhibition2010  Space Gallery, San Francisco, CA ,Grain Over Noise/Group Exhibition2010  SF Camerawork, San Francisco, CA,Roll Call/Group Exhibition2010  Space Gallery, San Francisco,CA, Communication/EYE94 Group Exhibition2010            Academy of Art University,San  Francisco, CA,Annual Spring Show/Honorable mention, portfolio2010  RayKo Photo Center, San Francisco, CA,3rd Annual Juried Pinhole Show/Featured artist  2010  79 New Montgomery Gallery, San Francisco, CA,Humanics/Group Exhibition2009 Academy of Art University,San Francisco, CA,Group Salon Exhibition2009 Academy of Art University, San Francisco, CA,Annual Spring show/3rd Place, Portraiture2008  Rayko Photo Center,San Francisco, CA,2nd Juried PinholePhotography/Group Exhibition2004 Maronie Gallery, Kyoto, Japan,9th Annual How Are You PHOTOGRAPHY? /Group Exhibition2002  Ississ Gallery, Kyoto, Japan,7th Annual How Are You PHOTOGRAPHY? /Group ExhibitionPUBLICATIONS2009   Magical Secrets About Chine Colle, Crown Point Press, San Francisco, CA2010   Roll Call,SF Camerawork, San Francisco, CA

The wisdom that we need appeals to the intellect as well as the heart and has been brought now to change the attitude of millions of people around the world.It is called My Heart's Song: The Odyssey of Sufi Hazrat Inayat Khan.and any donation above $15 will receive a letter for the IRS verifying your donation as deductible for income tax purposes ( 50 (c) (3) rules) for a public charity.Praveen Chaturvedi:""A long and interesting journey since my education in USC & UCLA and working with the hollywood and then coming back to India to setup my own production house Moonlight Pictures which gave me a chance to work with some of the finest talented people from both the industries, Hollywood & Bollywood. Here I pay my gratitudes to two of my most dearest friends Amin, from American Industry and Tom Alter from Indian Industry, with whom I got a chance to collaborate and work as a co-producer for the amazing film, which in the making, on the great sufi musician Hazrat Inayat Khan, who introduced Sufism to the west. Thankful to existence, to the spirit of Sufism and to my wonderful friends Amin And Tom who gave me this opportunity..""Here is our Website for My Heart's SongThis is a difficult time in the evolution of humankind. But it also has great promise! It seems that some kind of action is necessary for our life as a species to continue. But what action? Political? Economic? Prayer?It doesn't seem to work. As one thing is fixed, another something is broken. On and on it goes.Here is a one minute history of the last 120 years: Carbon based fuels powered automobiles, ships, trains, planes, heated homes, cooled homes and factories. World War I, Economic depression, World War II, Nuclear Energy, Cold War, Reactor melt downs, mass migrations, a billion people without clean drinking water....need I go on?And what do all of these things have in common?Probably not what you think.The rise of unfettered commercialism around the world really took off from about 1880 to the First World War.As a counter to the divide and conquer policies of the stronger nation states, a remarkable event took place in 1882 in the western State of Baroda in India.A boy was born in a Sufi family with a broad outlook whose childhood desire was to travel to the West. He grew into a remarkable man, argued for equality of the sexes and a return to more natural ways.. He brought forth in English a Message that called for raising humankind above the distinctions and differences that divide us, and a religious ideal that underpins all religions: we are all intertwined in the One God, One Life, One Universe. Not just as a philosophy, but as a practice that will lead humanity to a higher level.Except for serious musicians who may have encountered his talks on the Mysticism of Sound and Vibration, and some exceptional people like John Coltrane, Muhammad Ali ( who called his books the best books in the world), the industrialist Henry Ford, Ravel, the Zen Master Nogio Sensaki, not many Americans or Europeans know of him.We at Sophia Unity Foundation are dedicated to changing this, and changing it as quickly as possible. And we hope you agree that personal responsibility comes with our incredible freedom!Look into the comprehensive teachings and Message of Inayat Khan. I think you will agree that this is the keynote that will help unite humanity as one single extended family in the parenthood of the One.

                        My name is Nicole Kurtz, and I have just begun the Fall quarter of my junior year at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). As an Industrial Design major, I am learning many new things about the power of innovation, and how I can use my abilities as an artist to contribute to the world. This year, I have been continuing to improve my illustration skills, as well as taking classes in Graphic design. I have been looking forward to new academic adventures in my 2016 course load. In fact, I have recently been invited by one of my professors to join a small selected group of designstudents, as well asprofessional designersin an amazing opportunity this winter. From December 411th, I have been invited to join an organization called Project Resound on a social design trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  http://projectresound.com/Project Resound was founded on the belief that artists and designers are called to serve, support and assist in the promotion of beauty, love and justice. It is open to anyone who is passionate about using their creative skills to make a positive difference in the world.     This organization aims to carry out short-term projects that:  Promote cross-cultural exchange and multi-disciplinary collaboration  Provide exciting opportunities to employ our talents in the service of others  Inspire an atmosphere of teamwork, fun and friendship  Prove that extraordinary things can be accomplished with ordinary resources While on the trip, I will assist in offering design workshops to students and small business owners in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We will also be conducting RAD projects (Random Acts of Design), where we create something beautiful for someone and surprise them with it before we leavelast year, participants designed a logo for an entrepreneur who owned a small storehe loved it! I am excited about this opportunity to collaborate with other designers, and to share my talents and skills with those less fortunate than myself. In order for this trip to be possible, I am responsible to raise $2000 before November. This includes my flight, ground transportation, food, lodging, travel health insurance, and interpretative services. My goal is to raise some of the money necessary to go to Rio through your sponsorship.    As a designer, I want to bring change to the world. I know that visual art can go on to inspire for generations and can even spark further innovation. This opportunity to join Project Resound will be a challenge, that I am able and ready to take on. I am ready to inspire and be inspired. As the Project Resound illustrator I will be able to help small businesses expand their network, and use visual art to enhance their brand. The ability to immerse myself in a community and go on to help using design, which is what I love doing the most, is a once in a lifetime chance. If you would be willing to help sponsor me financially, any donations will be greatly appreciated.  I will be sure to update you all on the success of this project. Thank you all for your love and support! Sincerely, Nicole Kurtz

LOS ANGELES, CA                                





                        I am a female photographer and philanthropist in Los Angeles specializing Goddess portraiture, Women depicted in their empowered state of Goddess embodiment. Many womensuffer in silence from a life situation or particular circumstance, past or present, the result of which is ongoing trauma. My highest purpose is to elevate and uplift women through an empowering photo-session designed to bring out their inner Goddess.In mymany years of experience both in front of and behind the camera, I have been gracefully enabled to indelibly capture the unique essence of each woman's divine feminine nature as she first discovers and then embraces Her Higher-Self through Her inner/outer beauty. The outcome delivers an exquisite balance between her feminine and masculine energies.I use elements of Air, Fire, Water and Earth to embody the Goddess withinall ofus. Which element resonates most intensely with you? Which Goddess do you embrace and connect with? Identifying female energy with nature's Deities sharpens my focus on their inner strengths. This, I experience as pure magic and awareness.I am donating my time and inspiration to Women of all ages and walks of life. Each comes alive as my magical lens captures their discoveries while exploringthelatent divine feminine giftsthat emergein front of my camera in a safe, relaxed environment. I relish the dynamic between creator (photographer) and subject (woman).Confident that you'll enjoy my vision and purpose, I am seeking funding to create a gallery event showcasing the photographic imagery of these empowered women by fall/winter 2016. Donations will serve to underwrite the inaugural display of our efforts through this show and benefit after-party. Funding will be utilized to develop display materials, prints/framing, location venue and entertainment. A yet to be determined percentage will go to local anti-domestic violence supportgroups.My mission and vision is to get more involved with women support groups and create a positive movement by photographing, mentoring, teaching sisterhood and networking through art, music, food, nutrition, fitness/yoga, mental health, lifestyle mentoring etc...It is essential that we all promote an overall healthy lifestyle environment focusing on female empowerment (and female/male balance), all the while guiding, elevating and harmonizing with the divine Masculine. Let's re-connect with our Source and each other via this Portraiture Project.More of my work can be found at: www.cgvisionatrixphotography. wordpress.com & www.cgvisionatrix.tumblr.com(For this particular photo art gallery project, I will be releasing never-before-seen photographic prints specifically for the live show.)Photographer & PhilanthropistCarmen Garcia

                                                Greetings everyone! I am Fuji Fujimoto, a professional electric bass player and I am raising money for the recording of my solo album ""Skyrise"". The money will be used to pay for recording, mixing and mastering the album (8 piece band including a 4 man horn section), the cost of putting on a cd release show (venue rental, musicians, sound and light man fees), cd duplication and supporter rewards. I am the composer and arranger of all the songs and I want to share my creative effort with the world. My desire is to take listeners on a satisfying musical journey and to be inspired by what shows up along the way! I thank you all in advance for any support you choose to offer. I truly want to make it worth your time and money to take this sonic tour of my mind! In doing so you are helping me to evolve from side musician to solo artist. Your donations will also help the Khmer Child Foundation, to which I am giving 10% of the proceeds. This is a great nonprofit that provides life assistance to orphaned and disenfranchised Cambodian children. Here is the link for more information:  http://www.khmerchildfoundation.org/Thank you again for your time and please stay tuned for updates and progress videos!Till next time, Fuji Fujimoto

FREDERICK, MD                                




Be a part of Sky Stage -- a transformative arts project launching in Frederick, MD!Sky Stage is transforming a boarded building in Frederick's downtown historic district into a center for free arts and culture. This pre-Revolutionary War building was damaged by a major fire in 2010 and has no roof. On September 17th, the plywood boards on the doors and windows will be removed to reveal an interactive community art space. Sky Stage will offer free arts and cultural activities for children and adults including drama, music, childrens story time, art classes, folklore, history, naturalists and film. The heart of Sky Stage is a two story living sculpture with spirals of plants that will be irrigated with a rainwater catchment system.Sky Stage has grown from volunteer efforts of artist Heather Clark, the Frederick Arts Council, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AmeriCorps, Burning Man, local contractors, community members, and many local businesses. However, to get to the finish line, we need your help. Were asking you to help contribute the last $10,000 for project costs that could not be donated, such as insurance, specialty materials, and some specialty labor.Thank you for helping us finally take down the boards at 59 South Carroll Street and open Sky Stage to the public!(photo above by Bill Green for the Frederick News Post, video by Daniel Wyland)

Boy: A New Musical,"$2,625 ","$8,000 ",Creative," July 5, 2016",35,2,SAN DIEGO,CA,533000,1,,"






                            Jon Sangster
                            
                            
                                                           
SAN DIEGO, CA                                




Three years ago, I, Jonathan Sangster, decided it was time to put to paper a story that had swirled around my head for years. I knew it wasn't going to write itsself and I know in my heart it's an important story to tell. I knew it must be a musical. ""Who could write this with me? Who could I ask to be my composer/lyricist that would understand the importance of the story and help propel the themes beyond my own mind?"" Well, there was only one person I thought of; Matthew Hornbeck. Matt and I met in college. Matt has received an MA in Applied Sociology and an MFA in Arts Leadership. For both programs, Matt central focus was the research and implementation of art as a medium for progressive social change. Matts writing credits include the book and score for Pick Up Artist, The Musical and the book for Bean, The Musical ... Fruit?. Currently Matt is serving as the artistic director of the interdisciplinary Seattle-based arts community called quiet and teaches Sociology and Global Studies at Cascadia College. Matt is in the 2nd year of Saybrook Universitys PhD in Transformative Social Change program where he plans on continuing his research into the ways in which art acts as a tool of social change. You see, Matt has a knack for creating theatre for social change, and stories that matter and leave the audience with conversation and discussion. That's what this story needs. I was ecstatic when he instantly agreed to sign up for this adventure, and so, we began. After many phone conversations, some skype sessions, working diligently on our own(living in two seperate states) as well as a week writing intesnive, here we are, almost three years laterfrom our first conversation,with our first, completed, first draft of Boy:A New Musical. Boy: A New Musical. The Peter Pan we all know and love must come to terms with the real reason why he stayed so long in Neverland and what was the real reason he had so much animosity towards the Pirate Captain?When a young boy named Peter witnesses his father commit suicide, he, his mother, and sister move to a new town for a fresh start. They are welcomed with open arms by the community, particularly the town Pastor, James, and his family. James takes special notice of Peter, eager to help him through his grief by attempting to strengthen his relationship with God. When the relationship between James and Peter crosses a boundary as James struggles with his own demons, Peter creates a fantastical world within his mind in order to escape and ignore the abuse and sexual assault he encounters. The loss of innocence would make any lost boy want to fly away from their troubles, by any means necessary.I know there are people out there who might think, ""Why Peter Pan? It's a story that's been told and retold so many times!"" My answer to you is: Not like this. That is what makes this reimagining so special. It truly deconstructs the story we know so well, and gives reason to characters, relationships, and details in ways that have never been told. It takes a beloved story, and tells another that so many will be able to identify with, and hopefully, heal a wounded heart. Almost two years ago I was cast in a beautiful production of Spring Awakening, directed by J Scott Lapp (Associate/Assistant Directing credits include Broadway: Bonnie & Clyde; National Tour: Murder for Two, Xanadu (La Jolla Playhouse, National Tour); Off-Broadway: Murder For Two (New World Stages, Second Stage); Regional: Rain (Old Globe), Disneys The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Paper Mill Playhouse, La Jolla Playhouse), Into the Woods (Old Globe) and many more). I was truly changed by this production and the masterful direction he provided. While being housed at his family home, I noticed a painting of Peter Pan on the wall and found out it was he who painted it. J and his sister Chelsea, (Associate Choreographer of Spring Awakening), both lovePeter Pan. If that wasn't a""God wink"" than I don't know what is! I casually mentioned to J that I was writing a musical, a reimagining of Peter Pan, and he was very quick to set up a lunch meeting to discuss more. A lunch meeting turned into a declaration of helping the success of this piece by any means necessary. The stars were aligning. Well, here we are, almost 2 years, 1 table read, and a completed musical, later, taking the next steps in bringing Boy: A New Musical to life. In order to create the best, most effective version of this story, it's important to take the proper steps in doing so. (Especially with Broadway in sight. Gotta dream big!)We have planned a reading of the entire book and music for Seattle for October 16 and then astaged reading of entire show in San Diegofor December 18. It's all happening! We all know that producing art, in any form, isn't cheap, by any means! Which is why we are here and where you come in. You have the opportunity to help bring to life and help in supportinga beautiful story that I hope will one day bring peace to so many. Between the two, reading and staged reading, we are making a goal of raising at least $8,000. J Scott Lapp has so generously agreed to volunteer his time, efforts and expertise, to which we are eternally grateful for. However, we do want to cover travel and housing expenses for us on the production side for both endeavors. And no musical can come to life without actors, musical direction, accompanist,and a great stage manager. Eachdeserving some pay for the talents they provide as well. We can't forget about space rental fees. We already have solidified rehearsal and performance space in Seattle, which is very exciting. We will be rehearsing and performing the reading at the Seattle City Center, in the heart of downtown Seattle, right next to the amazing Space Needle.Regarding the staged reading in San Diego, wehavea rehearsal space provided in Temecula , and we will be hoping to secure a performance location in San Diego shortly. Not to mention all the expenditures for printing needs and beyond. It will take a village to bring this advenure to life. With your help, generosity, and the heart poured into this endeavor,we can bring this story to fruition. Any donation amount will help, and we will be forever grateful for. Since the readings are being produced through The Barn Stage Company, a non profit 501(c)3 organization, it is important to know that all donations made in supportare tax deductible.We hope that you will find it in your heart to donate and help support this incredible journey.This is just the beginning! Thank you!

Hi!As many of you may know, my dream is to one day be a professional perfomer on the Great White Way!However, things haven't always been easy for me, living in a single parent household with a father who never cared for me meant that, like many other budding young perfomers I haven't had everything handed to me on a plate. I've worked very hard to be where I am and I've given a lot of my time and effort for free.I feel now however I need to be selfish and ask for help.All this money will be used to fund the travel to my auditions and also for audition fee's.I will also be donating 10% of the funds to Broadway Cares/ Equity Fights Aids , a charity that supports organisations helping to fightHIV and Aids by using the unique talents of the Theatre Community.I need all funds by November 31st this is to give me a month to make sure I have submitted all of my applications and booked my travel.I am so grateful for any donations so please dont feel bad for not donating if you cant, I know what that feels like.This means a hell of a lot to me and believe me, when I make it and write my autobiography 'Fifty Shades of Fuschia Pink', I'll make sure you all get a mention and I'll pay you all back with added interest ;)Many Thanks,Elliot xx

                        2016 James & Jackie White Recording!For over twenty-three years, we have served as full-time worship pastors. We have had the privilege to mentor worship teams and work with worship leaders across the country. God has given us numerous worship songs that have been recorded by various artists and ministries globally. James produced and recorded 3 ""LIVE"" Night of Praise recordings with the Calvary Temple ""Praise Choir"" of Indianapolis. Jackie is a songwriter who has written some incredible songs that have been used in churches and ministries worldwide. Two of her songs, All Belongs To You and My Deliverer were made popular by Judy Jacobs. My Deliverer was also a part of a Choral Collection called High Praises by Phil Barfoot and the late Lari Goss earned her a Dove Award. Another song entitled Wave of My Anointing (Fresh Wind) was made popular by Alvin Slaughter. We have been tremendously blessed to work with some incredible singers and musicians over the years. We are now in a great season to release arecording that is not affiliated with one particular church. Our Heart Story-We have noticed that todays corporate worship is becoming trendy. Which is not all bad, but we believe that worship should not be geared toward a certain age group or demographic. It should be solely focused on glorifying the Lord and bringing the entire Body of Believers, both young and old, into Gods Presence! We feel that worship cannot simply be defined by one genre or style of music. There are many churches that recognize that there is a tremendous gap between the generations and cultures, but dont know what to do to change this dynamic. We are providing a solution to help bridge that gap with blended worship music so that congregations can unify in heart and spirit to worship The God of the Ages.What type of Worship Project is this?- This is more than a recording with James & Jackie White. Its a Mosaic Work of Kingdom Songs  Declaring the Supreme Authority of The Almighty God! It's an eclectic blend of music from various songwriters, singers, and musicians. The track list consists of all original songs.Recording Project's Purpose This project is designed to be a praise &worship bridge and resource, that provides vibrant, multicultural, trans-generational, worship music to churches globally.Cost  Our goal to raise $15,000 to finish the recording. This is include mixing, mastering, PR , marketing, printing, CD's , multi-tracks, and distribution.How Can You Help? Whatever you can do to help us complete this recording will be greatly appreciated, everything little bit helps. There is no seed that is too great or too small. Thank you in advance for your support.We are looking forward to connecting with you in the days and weeks ahead to keep you updated.Love You All,James & Jackie

"""Seatbelts Required"" the movie","$1,240 ","$7,000 ",Creative," August 14, 2016",13,1,VENTURA,CA,396000,,1,"






                            Kimberly Demmary
                            
                            
                                                           
VENTURA, CA                                





                        Hello! My name is Kimberly Demmary, Writer and Executive Producer of Seatbelts Required, the play and the movie.This film has been a long time in the making. It actually started as a semi-biographical play. Seatbelts Required or The Play I Wrote to Piss off my Sisters Which it didnt by the waypiss off my sisters. They loved it.The StoryAfter their mothers funeral, three sisters gather attheir childhood home,and try to come to terms with the destruction their mother brought to their lives. As the afternoon progresses, they hesitantly try to connect through remembered laughter and sorrow as harrowing memories of their childhoods are brought to the surface.The Play's HistoryIt was first produced on stage in North Hollywood, Ca. And has since been picked up in 3 other cities in CA and AZ, as well as performed at the One Act at the AAACT Festival. (Next year a friend is doing a stage reading of it for a retirement home and using the current inhabitants as actors. Should be great fun to see mature ladies hashing out past sibling issues, while sitting inside a cardboard car box!)Every actress that has worked on the play version has found bits of themselves in their characters and said it was therapy for them on stage. Audience members would be crying by the end of the show, (which made me very happy). Before they left the theater, they would hug me and say they were sorry for me (dont worry, SOME of the story is fictional) and that they too had the same childhood (which scared me to think that people could have truly grown up in these disturbing situations). Others would insist they were going to go home and call their mother, or sister and tell them that they loved them. I want to convey all those feeling in this film.The show has been tried and tested. reviewed and rewritten with every production. Its ready for the big screen. I am working with a great production company but we need your help.The Movie's Proposed Budget(In order of priority)$1,125.00 = Actors$1,755.00 = Location$300.00 = Crafts Services$1,125.00 = Camera Operators$375.00 = Director$100.00 = Props$300.00 = Wireless Audio Gear$1,500.00 = Video Cameras$420.00 = Video Editor$7,000 = Project TotalYou can read a more detailed budget on our website atseatbeltsrequired.com/budget.htmlThe Movie's Actors & CrewFrom Top Left:Joanna Bert - ""Maggie""Kimberly Demmary - ""Janet""Julio Lonnie Lopez - Assistant DirectorLea Baskas Roman - ""Agnes""John Barker - DirectorWhy We Need Your HelpI have been working in theater for 15+ years (over a hundred shows under my belt) and I can count how many times Ive been paid as an actress on one hand (I am holding upthree fingers). So our first order with the budget is paying cast and crew!Yes, we have many, many actor-friends who would gladly help us out with this project for free (there is so much love out there for Seatbelts Required). But why should they? Actors deserve to get paid for their time, dedication, and commitment to the project. The same goes for the crew because no one works harder and more tirelessly than crew!The most important location in the films is the childhood home for the three sisters. The house is truly its own character in the film. Inside and out. So staging and finding the PERFECT location is crucial to the story. In order to keep homeowners happy and comfortable with a film crew invading their home for weeks, we have to pay them accordingly.This feature film deserves to be done right. The soundtrack, the cinematography, everything.One of my goals with this picture is to submit it to film festivals and hopefully gain some footing as a female screenwriter to look out for. I am so excited for Seatbelts Required to be everything I have always dreamed it to be from the time of its original conception when the entire play took place in a car (hence the title).We have come a long way baby!So please help us out and donate to this beautiful film.To find out more about this project, visit our website: www.SeatbeltsRequired.comFROM THE TECHNICAL DIRECTORSince this is a play being changed into a movie, we have to approach this with a different ""eye"". The dialogue is so fast and natural that shooting this in a traditional one camera style will not suffice to capture the essence of the play.To achieve a more natural fluid speaking pace and speed up work flow on location, I propose that we shoot this with three cameras simultaneously. Similar to a soap opera, a sitcom, or many primetime dramas, a three camera style shoot allows for the actors to complete the scene in one continuous motion without having to constantly stop to reposition the camera. Though, in our case, will not switch the cameras live, but instead, we will sync the cameras and switch between them in the post-production.I have directed 4 short films, 3 documentaries, and have been technical director on countless live news casts along with live training videos; all utilizing multi-camera setups. I am familiar with its pitfalls and strengths, as come with any production style. One of the hurdles with producing this way is having to match all three cameras, which is easily overcome with having three identical cameras and using ""flat"" lighting. One of the strengths of producing with multiple-cameras is that you can switch cameras in the editing process allowing the actor to stay in character longer and giving the director more choices in the edit room.It's a unique approach for many independent moviemakers, but that is apart of the process, to progress the art. In our case, we will be purchasing all of our equipment so that we can continue to produce many more movies this way. We have at least 4 more scripts lined up to produce after we complete ""Seatbelts Required"". By owning the equipment, it not only decreases the costs of future productions, but it also allows us to practice consistantly with the equipment that we will have.A three camera setup will have a higher upfront cost initially, but it will save us on time since we are shooting scenes faster, which in turn will save us on money for this movie and for future projects as well.To find out more about this project, visit our website: www.SeatbeltsRequired.com

Finishing costs for my documentary,$635 ,"$5,000 ",Creative," August 30, 2016",14,26,WINNETKA,CA,56000,,4,"






                            Mark DiNatale
                            
                            
                                                           
WINNETKA, CA                                




My name is Mark DiNatale, an almost 20 year resident of Los Angeles. I came out here with the dream to make films. Much of that took a detour when real life set in and the need for a job took center stage. But my love for film and video production never waived.I finally acquired my degree from CSUN in 2012, and decided to start recording family events. Since then I have recorded several weddings, parties, conducted lots of interviews, and created marketing videos for people to use on their websites, along with many school, and theater performances, but I have always wanted to make a documentary.It was about two years ago when the moment happened. I saw a documentary about the Asian hot sauce, Sriracha, directed by Griffin Hammond. I was blown away by how interesting this documentary about hot sauce was.Right about that time, a friend gave me an idea. he knew I had all the camera equipment, and knew I always wanted to make a movie with it. Sadly he moved out of state, but he says to me, ""Nostalgia"", and that was it. He let me take that idea and do with it what I pleased.Cut to 2016, I have a full 70-minute documentary completed. I wrote it, shot it, directed it, and produced it, by myself. When it came to the editing, social media getting the word out, that was all me as well.The film is called, ""The Business of Nostalgia "". it's fully edited, and has even been picked up to play in The Valley Film Festival on October 1st, 2016.I am asking for your help with finishing costs. The film needs to have the sound remixed, and I have hired a professional sound mixer to give it that professional theater sound. This film is supposed to be my calling card for future work and I want to be sure I showcase this project in the best possible light. That comes with a price, and while this person gave me an amazing deal, it is still something I need help with obtaining.The other thing that the money raised will go towards is something called a DCP copy of the film.This is the definition according to Wikipedia (DCP is a collection of digital files used to store and convey Digital Cinema audio, image, and data streams ). The theater is requesting this in order to play the night of the screening. The DCP also comes with a cost associated with it, and really the only cost that I hadn't factored in during this entire process.All this has to happen over the course of the next 21 days to make it ready for the screening on October 1st.The bulk of the work is done. I used my money, my time putting this together. I just need that little boost to help me get this film to be the best version if it that it can be. That is where you come in. With your donations all the money is going towards the final steps of getting this film ready for exhibition in a theater for a festival that it has already been accepted to.If there is any money made above the goal, it is going towards funding its release on Amazon Prime and ITunes in the early part of 2017. So no matter what amount you donate, any and all of it goes towards this film and finishing it or aiding in its wider release on streaming platforms in 2017.I am turning to those that have always encouraged me, cheered for me, and have wished me well. I feel real good about the film that I created, but just need that extra ""boost"" to push it to the next level. We can do that with your help and support.

If you cannot give finanically, I encourage you to share this campaign with others let your friends and family know about this project. Not just for the money, but I want people to be interested in the subject as well. I am hoping to turn this into a bigger idea that can be explored with a budget and a crew down the road.

I thank you for your time, and I certainly thank you for all the encouragement and support I have from many of you all these years. Let's help see this project though!

                        A true Brahmin, he taught through action, devoting his life to guide, share and serve others in whatever way he could. A mentor for many, his brilliance as a wordsmith drew the reader in, engaging them on common ground - the pursuit of strength. From this point, he took us by the hand and guided us on a journey of personal discovery. This was the very same path he walked to turn himself from the self-titled meat head lifter into a uniquely enlightened teacher. Using humour and his telltale no-bullshit approach he helped us understand that to be truly strong in mind, body and spirit, we have to embrace change in all its forms. It can be rough and painful as hell, but it leads to something far greater on the other side.Wielding his pen and chalk as deftly as a Samurai, he cut down complex ideas and built back a simple and elegant message. This message was his guiding principleBe humble and relinquish all desires. Instead, give all you have with love and life will surely deliver all its possibilities in abundance.His deep compassion and love extended outwards from being a devoted family man and loving husband, to a dear friend, an inspiring coach and a true leader. His beautiful soul will ever resonate through his work, his voice and the words he left us. But the journey doesnt stop here. His light will continue to burn bright within Iron Heart Studios, which will launch as planned in the coming months. This is his legacy.If youd like to help make Chriss dreams for his art and his family a reality, you can offer your support here.

We also need to raise money for merchandise such as hats, clothes, stickers, car decals, posters and more in an effect to direct more people to the website in a modern and urban way to appeal to people of all ages and colors. Office space, laptops, camera equipment to ensure the best quality possible for our hearing viewers as well as music video entertainment for our deaf viewers with captions thus leading to more accessibility! I have kept this project alive for 5 years creating a grassroots foundation and the more we push Deafinitely Dope out to the masses, the greater the public response becomes and the stronger the desire to learn ASL becomes, simply through a universal love of music!

The National Cannabis Patients Wall,"$2,607 ","$5,000 ",Creative," May 15, 2014",78,28,NASHVILLE,TN,1800,2,26,"

NASHVILLE, TN                                




An ongoing project, with currently over5000 patients, and over17,000 supporters, from 38 countries that are publicly standing together in solidarity for what should be our right to include Medical Cannabis therapies in our medical regimes. ""The Wall"" not only signifies our solidarity as patients in need of a safe and effective alternative to harsh pharmaceuticals, it also signifies the barriers we must overcome, our current State and Federal laws, that keep us from the medicine we desire and need. The project is mobile so that it can go to all supporting marches and rallies that are being planned. Currently the project has produced a TN State ""Wall"", that has over 70 patient photos, 88 panels, 1,163 type blocks and a current size of 5 1/2' x 82.33'

Our goal is to produce a 100' Wall for each State. Each State's Wall will be presented at their State's Capital. Then all will be joined together in Washington D.C. for a MILE long Wall!

We hope to gain support for the Wall production costs, the racking systems that will enable them to be free standing and displayable at any event. Our own website and obtaining our 501 (C)4 Status.

From all the groups supporters and the Wall Patients, we humbly and most gratefully thank you for your support.

Website/Own Label/Free Access,"$3,790 ","$6,000 ",Creative," November 27, 2015",64,10,Enmore,NSW,904000,,7,"






                            Louis Tillett
                            
                            
                                                           
Enmore, NSW                                




""I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU EVERYTHING""Because of the wonderful response to the original gofundme campaign, it has given Louis both the enthusiasm and the willingness to achieve, what for him, was his ideal plan for so many years, regarding his musical catalogue. For decades, he has been trying to find suitable partners to put his entire catalogue of albums, film & TV footage, and radio recordings, from around the world, under one roof, and to make it available worldwide in the simplest, most accessible way. Having had one last attempt, in the past 12 months, to release an (archival re-issue of an) album with a Record Label, the disappointment had him confounded once again, as to why something so simple should be so poorly executed. In the past, Louis has considered Digital Downloads a problem as there has been no incentive for distributors and promoters in local territories to underwrite concerts (for touring opportunities) since their income and financial interests have been undercut by the ""worldwide distribution"" of New Releases. However, he has found that the goodwill of his audience has been so expressly manifested in the previous campaign, that he has decided to have a Website professionally built, and have all of his Back Catalogue and other material digitized, in the highest quality, and made available for FREE, through the ONE HUB.Other benefits of the previous campaign was that new people were being introduced by older fans to his music and wanted to hear more but found there was nowhere they could purchase the music. There were a few grossly overpriced RARE CDs and Vinyls on eBay and Amazon. For instance, he recently saw ""Soliloquy"" - as an Australian import selling for $120, on one of these multinational sites, when he himself has a couple of hundred in his possession, that he has often given to his supporters for the cost of postage. And it's something that hurts him personally when he has gone to such great lengths over the years to make everything available (and affordable) to everyone that is interested.And fans seem to be concerned that they have been unable to pay Louis when purchasing his music. There is also the concern that where there ARE ""dribs and drabs"" scattered over blogsites and ""free download"" sites (complete with viruses adware, and malware), BUT in reality there has been NOWHERE to source ALL of his music, without some compromise.So, to allay all fears and concerns, and to enable Louis to manage and realise his musical objectives as directly and quickly as possible, this website will be the one and only HUB for his music, which he will manage himself, with hired professional ongoing support. And because he is in the unique position of OWNING the COPYRIGHT to his ENTIRE body of work, he has the FREEDOM to do with it as he wishes. And it is not without great sacrifice, emotional pain and frustration, that he has fiercely maintained his independence and ownership - so as to be able to do this one day. It has only been a case of Third Parties disrupting his best laid plans by overpromising and under-delivering (as so many fans seeking his every release in the past will attest to) that he has been unable to consistently release New Music. Even after recording and being ready for release...he has often had the 3rd Party letting him down.He has attempted to launch this web site idea before through other well meaning third parties, but this too has been problematic and led to delays as he has not had the access to source codes and also life (& death) has gotten in the way of those who have tried to help, leading to crossed wires and more delays. So now, with your assistance, Louis can take complete control, responsibilty and accountability for his own body of work and delivery of the best quality of music, video and other archival material, and, in future, NEW releases through this Self-Managed Website, with the appropriate Technical Support. Once all of this has been made available, he will then be able to reach his final goal of donating all the source material to the National Film and Sound Archives of Australia - as per their own initiative. And hence this will become a gift to everyone in Australia and beyond, for perpetuity.There will be a Voluntary Donation box, for those who can afford to assist him to continue the upkeep of the website and the ongoing goals of writing, recording, and distributing NEW WORK: including new Music, a Book, and a screenplay/script for a proposed Full Length Documentary Film, among other projects. And as mentioned before, Louis will receive these Donations directly, and will be able to make the best use of them, by making his own decisions, and determining his own direction.There will also be a forum for people to contribute their own photos, bootlegs or memories to share with the rest of the world.This is a fairly big undertaking, and will have most costs figured into the start-up. But the goal is to achieve ""Go Live"" by the 13th March 2016 - which coiincides with Louis' birthday - and marks the anniversary of the debut this year of THE ART OF DARKNESS - which was Louis' own tribute to the people who had so generously helped him in the previous campaign, while they had asked for nothing in return. Louis still has plans to tour this ensemble, and some smaller concerts, but this website/portal is his CURRENT priority, as it will enable him a to create a small margin of ongoing income to fund touring concerts, and hopefully the website will introduce more potential patrons for the Live performances. Along with the Publishing mechanism that this WEBSITE/HUB offers, it will hopefully achieve a greater audience development, introducing more people to Louis' music, and expanding the collections of those who have incomplete catalogues of his Music. And for those who want HARD COPY CDs and Vinyls, the income can generate the means to perhaps remaster and reissue back catalogue, compilations and of course NEW works. This can also be the One Stop Shop, where Louis can arrange Concert Ticketing and a database of fans, so he can plan his tours more directly, with the appropriate links, and allowing feedback and suggestions from you all. It is your generosity thus far that has given Louis the conviction to launch this HUB, as there are really only TWO relevant entities, when it comes to music. Both are equally important. That is...the performers/crew, in the presenting of the music, and the audience. Third parties and middlemen are often unnecessary, and sometimes (inexplicably) downright obstructive. And it has most often been the case that these third parties have caused untold disruption, and blemished what should otherwise be a sublime interaction. You have shown your commitment. And now Louis is able to show you his. He has always wished for this, and again, has gone though great pains to produce what he has done already. But the ideal is that EVERYONE will win this way. And it will be a uniting force for good, that is both uniquely intimate and shared.Your assistance NOW will enable him to make everything he has created thus far FREELY available and accessible to ALL. This is our opportunity for a SHARED ALTRUSIM connecting many through a mutually shared experience. For every donation, Louis will contact you directly and ask for your permission to thank you publicly.

Fund to Finish Novel and Degree,"$3,605 ","$4,300 ",Creative," September 29, 2015",50,12,SCRANTON,PA,114000,1,,"






                            Shawna Hogan
                            
                            
                                                           
SCRANTON, PA                                





                        When I left college on indefinite medical leave in 2012 due to a mental health emergency, I made a promise to myself after the crisis had passed: I would have to use this time to focus on finding and sustaining the right treatments for the Bipolar II illness (and the Type 1 diabetes that has often suffered because of it) that has been disruptive to my life since I was a teenager, in the hopes that I could finish my undergraduate studies in English and go on to get my MFA, as well as complete several large writing projects that I had undertaken in the past several years-- all of which, like my education, were interrupted continually by depressive and manic episodes, or hospital stays. I knew it was time to address these interconnected issues seriously and openly, with the aggression and patience that would be required, and that if I kept trying to ignore its influence on my life and neglecting proper treatment, mental illness would end up defining it.I am happy to say that this wasn't just a passing resolution, although the patience I mentioned has been tried more than I envisioned when I set out on the journey; it took some time to figure out which doctors to leave and which new ones to stick it out with, find more constructive counseling, try different medications, cease the habit of discontinuing them when I felt more balanced, and integrate holistic care like yoga and meditation to combat medicinal side-effects... all of this took time, but was essential. I can say now that, while there are still daily difficulties involving both illnesses, I am managing them and the symptoms successfully. I don't feel as if my choices are so limited now, or that my dreams are too big for my disabilities.Somewhere in that time of trial and error, and slowly starting to feel a sense of normalcy, I began writing again. For the first time in quite a long while, I didn't delve into poems, stories, and essays on a wave of high energy, working until a depressive episode replaced it and everything that was unfinished was abandoned, or often, scrapped altogether. I set daily and weekly goals for each project, and began to learn how to adapt my writing schedule around symtoms that do still persist (although in a less severe form). A collection of poems took shape and has since been finished, along with a number of short stories, and I've recently started to send them off in hopes of publication.Where this campaign comes in has to do with the other (and the biggest) work I've been developing, which is a novel. In it, I've been exploring ideas about what might be called a soul -- how do beliefs about what a soul is align or misalign with our experience of it? How is it at its most eloquent for each of us, and how do we come to detach from feeling and expressing it? And, in that alienation, how does it, and do we, find ways to still communicate, or fail? -- drawing from both memory and imagination to examine the intersections between soul and place, sexuality, myth, religious experience, mental illness, love, violence, and creativity. In the navigation of these intersections by the characters (one of whom is based on myself), the story is told.The money I'm hoping to raise by mid- October 2016, is to be combined with my savings from the past year or so for an intensive writing trip to England in order to finish the last few sections of (and the prologue and epilogue to) this book, as well as to visit several Universities in order to speak with International Admissions Counselors about applying to finish my English Literature degree. Besides this, some of the funds will be going for school and visa application costs. The location of England for completing the novel isn't irrelevant: The county and landscape of Derbyshire features importantly in the novel, and I would love the opportunity to explore its landscape, architecture, and people, while working on those. But also, it was on a solo trip through England in 2002 that two specific desires were sparked; one, to eventually come back for school, and the other, begun as a journal of ideas, notes, character sketches, and memories that I kept while on my travels, to develop this material into my first novel.What I was not ready to do at the time, though, was exactly what these past four years have been about -- to stop pushing the reality of my mental illness and diabetes aside, find how to best treat them, and how to sustain their management. As a result, the years after I returned home were still spent in cycles of ill health and hospitals, then trying to work and write at an intense pace in order to ""catch up"" on the time that had been lost. When I did begin pursuing my degree, I had a number of academic successes, had the opportunity to participate in a number of inspiring, engaging courses with professors I admired, and forged invaluable relationships at the University of Scranton. I do not regret the experience. But the manias, depressive episodes, and extreme blood-sugars prevented a successful ending there, and continued to postpone any sustained effort at writing the novel and finishing my other projects. I am lucky; I finally began recieving the help I need in order to live a fuller life, work more consistently, and create the things I want to create. I've accomplished a number of goals, and have followed through with my commitment to the biggest, the novel. Now it's time to finish it, as well as my Bachelor's degree. I have a plan, timetable, and health for it, and a job that can go a long way in making this a reality. But, I will need help. If you're interested in my story and would like to contribute to its outcome, I would be sincerely grateful for any donation you might be able to give.Be well, friends, and thank you so much for your time!Shawna Hogan

The feedback from viewers has been INCREDIBLE, andthe continuoussupport is what's givingus the motivation to make another season happen.However, we do need help. The entire first season was produced independently on a Digiorno budget. We say Digiorno, because that's all we could afford to feed the cast while shooting for 14-16 hours a day. We, the producers, are a young couple trying to make it in NYC and we used the money we earnfrom our day jobs to put this together.If you help us reach our goal, not only can we guarantee you another season, but we can assure you that we will take everything to the next level!It can only go up from here, but we can't do this alone.We're grateful for anything that you can contribute.

Let's Raise the stage at Anicinabe Park!!Kenora needs a community stage. Were going to build one at Anicinabe Park.Kenora is diverse and unique, brimming with talent, culture and life. We need a space that is easy to access where people can come together to celebrate, showcase and encourage art in all of its forms.We have the perfect space at Anicinabe Park, and local businesses have already jumped in to set the project in motion. Now we need our community to get behind this cause, help us raise the funds so we can make the vision a reality!Potential uses for this space:Music! The original inspiration for the community stage concept came from the Wednesday Night Jam Nights at Anicinabe Park. It became clear that we have a deep pool of local talent who were happy to play in the pavilion beside the Anicinabe Park store, and they werent picky about the awkward space or poor acoustics that space offered. Imagine what we could do with a space designed with them in mind!The wide open grassy field will allow us to accommodate larger assemblies, opening the door for small to medium sized acts to come and perform outdoor concerts, enhancing Kenoras already respected live music scene.Performance Arts, Entertainment, Community Gatherings & Celebrations!Music is only the beginning. Think: Talent shows, school events, outdoor movies, outdoor theatre, children's parties, picnics, seniors events, yoga - the idea is for it to be an inclusive and versatile space that everyone can use.Culture!Anicinabe Park has a fascinating history with deep ties to our Aboriginal people. The stage has been designed to incorporate the Four Cardinal points on the Medicine Wheel which are the Four Sacred Directions, represented among the Ojibwe by the colours yellow, red, black and white.The venue will present an opportunity for sharing, teaching, healing and celebrating our rich and diverse culture. Anicinabe Park has always been a place for people to come together, and that is the driving motivation for this endeavor. We are determined - this stage will be built!Our total budget is $50 000. In addition to the GoFundMe Campaign, we are seeking corporate donations for approximately 50% of the project.All donations go directly to an account that has been set up solely for this stage. If our fundraising goal is exceeded, funds will be held in the account and used for future stage-related expenses such as repair & maintenance and potentially, booking acts.Our tentative construction timeline is to have the stage completed by October 31, 2016. But we need your help! Any contribution you are willing and able to make is sincerely appreciated.1. Who you are - I am Scott Green the manager of the Anicinabe Park property2. Where you're from - I am from Kenora3. Your relationship to the parties you're raising funds for - I am raising the funds for the City of Kenora as the manager of the park4. How the funds will be used (be specific as possible)The funds will be used to build this stage for the use of the public5. If you intend to withdraw the money, how you plan to send the funds to the parties you're raising money for or use the money on their behalfOnce the money is raised we transfer to the City of Kenora and the city pays the bill to build the stage.

                                                            for EVANSVILLE CIVIC THEATRE INC

EVANSVILLE, IN                                





                        Evansville Civic Theatre (ECT) is a premier community theatre organization in southwestern Indiana. We are about to embark on an exciting chapter in our history that will enhance our ability to provide quality dramatic programming to the greater Evansville community, and we invite our patrons and supporters to be a part of this adventure.For the first time in more than four decades, ECT was presented with the opportunity to acquire the adjacent property at 715 North Fulton Avenue and occupy the entire corner of Fulton and Columbia. With your help, we see this as an opportunity to improve and beautify our property and the neighborhood as a whole by purchasing this property, razing the house, expanding and paving our parking area, and increasing our exterior lighting. We estimate investing $50,000 into this project, and the Arts Council of Southwestern Indiana generously provided a matching grant for every dollar raised by ECT up to $25,000! To date, ECT has raised more than $14,000 for this project for a total of nearly $30,000 including the Arts Council's matching funds. With these funds, ECT has purchased the property and scheduled the demolition of the house. To reach our goal and take this project over the finish line, we are asking for 300 of our loyal supporters to donate at least $30. The sooner we raise the remaining funds, the sooner you will enjoy the new and improved ECT experience! Although the theme is $30 from 300, we are grateful for donations of any size. And remember, the Arts Council will match every dollar donated! Completing this project will elevate the quality of our patrons, volunteers', and staff's experience by providing a more aesthetically pleasing site upon arrival, easier access to the building, and a greater sense of security. The ability to expand and improve our parking will also allow us to better serve both the seniors and the disabled in our community. With our current small, gravel lot, we are not able to provide handicapped designated parking spaces. This will be an important part of our improved lot, making our productions available to or more convenient for a large and underserved segment of our community.We at ECT are so grateful for your support. As a token of our appreciation, everyone who donates at least $30 to this campaign will be recognized in the 2016-17 main stage production programs. Thank you for your generosity, and we look forward to seeing you this season at ECT!

Technology has caused the means by which children learn to shift from auditory to more visual and tactile. Educational digital media has become very popular. The main objective of these educational programs is to disseminate information using captivating pedagogy. Many of the current pedagogical tools lack contemporaneous and universal appeal. EdAnime Productions was created to address these deficiencies.Our company was established by Dr. Bailey,andLuther Clinton Elliottand a host of teenagers with the goal to modernize the content and presentation of academic material. We produce educational animated lessons for elementary and middle school children in the areas of history, mathematics, and science.The lessons are engaging and filled with scholastic material not present in a traditional curricula. Our lessons utilize hip hop music as a pedigogical tool, pop-up visuals, relatable characters, and comedy to enhance learning.What makes our company extraordinary is that our lessons are created for children of all nationalities, economic, and ethnic groups. In addition, the creative forces of the film consists of highly experienced educators, animators, cartoonists, engineers and children (between the ages of 9 and 16). Children play vital roles in the productions. They are involved in character designing, background designing, storyboarding, scripting, and voiceovers.Our aim is to promote education, improve grades, increase standardized test scores and foster the three ""Selves"": Self-awareness, Self-esteem, andl Selfless service. We hope that our products aid in shaping the minds, attitudes, and behavior of the youth for the sole purpose of building stronger and healthier communities

                        The Barren County High School orchestra has only been in existence for 4 short years and is already gaining local, state, and national recognition. Earlier in the year, BCHS orchestra auditioned for the honor of playing at Carnegie Hall and was one of eight groups accepted to perform in the World Strides Heritage Festival. They will travel to New York in April. The students of our orchestra program have incredible passion and drive, but some of them lack the funds to afford such an opportunity as this. We have high hopes that the community will pull together and make this happen for our incredibly talented group of growing musicians.The total amount to raise is $60,000. The first payment of $12,000 is due in September, which is what we are planning to cover with these funds. Thank you in advance for your support. If you are local, please come and see us in concert through the year. We have a Fall concert on October 27th and our Winter concert on Dec. 15th. Both will be in the BCHS Auditorium.

PROTECTING CREATIVE RIGHTS,"$1,555 ","$25,000 ",Creative," April 19, 2016",192,5,CLEARWATER,FL,434000,1,4,"

CLEARWATER, FL                                





                        Have you ever created an idea, a concept, a song, a stage play a musical or anything of value that was stolen right from under you with no regards by the person who perpertrated the ACT?  Well, if so then you understand when I say that this has recently happen to me. Not only has it affected me but it has affected the numerous prospective Cast members that have high hopes of being a part of this project. For almost a year now I have been promoting my auditions and plans for my new positive Reality TV show called ""THE ACTION REALITY ACTORS"", The show would follow the lives of ten struggling actors and entertainers.  Although the Title of my show ""THE ACTION REALITY ACTORS"" along with the many faces of the prospective Cast members had been promoted on my Facebook page for more than a year, the concept and written treatment for this project was only shared with the (one) person who was hired to produce this project.It is unfortunate however, that my written concecpt, synopsis and Treatment, was unlawfully shared by the same Producer that I had hired to produce my show and as a result of this another show by another name with the same concept aired on the same Network, while my show was still in development. But what does one do, they fight and never give up on their dreams because to much time and talent has been invested. So we re-write our concept.I have already set out to prove this claim and have already hired a reputable entertainment Attorney who believes my story based on the information and documents received from me. The matter is being looked at and it looks favorable.  As you may know, Reputable Attorney's will not even consider taking on ones case if they don't feel the case has any merit. It's now just a matter of proving that my idea that was unlawfully used is what the legal systems call a ""NOVEL IDEA"" .  We habe set out to prove such.As you know legal expenses in order for one to right a wrong can be costly as well as timely. However, when your concepts and ideas have been infringed upon and so many young talents who were involved are also affected by the wrong doing of others to me it is worth the fight. Am I wrong for wanting Justice? If you have ever at any point in your life been betrayed, then you understand the pain one might feel when they are faced with this sort of unfortunate experience. But what does one do? They continue to fight to protect their ideas and remain positive as they continue to pusue their dreams in spite of it all.Although,  I have already gone to the expense of retaining an attorney, we anticipate the legal fees will grow until this matter is resolved. Your support will make a difference in this legal fight for Justice to protect our shows concept .We realize that unfortunately the theft of concepts and ideas happen all the time and I'm certainly not the first to fall victim. Some people might chose to let it go and move on but my Cast and I choose to fight to protect our concept ideas legally.Many of you reading this Story might be familiar with some of the Contenders of this project who each got involved through my friends list on Facebook. Again, this matter is not about me, but those numerous contenders who have high hopes of being a part of the cast for our new TV Reality show, which is designed to inspire, motivate and empower young talented hopefuls. Not the negative or ratchet but the positive aspects of those involved.Our filming of our SIZZLE for May 14th, 15th, and 16th has been delayed at the request of legal council and we will resume Production in July 2016.Creative Talents are Gifts from God and in my opinion, no one has the right to infringe on others work. So we are calling on your support to help us with our Legal support Team so that we can continue our production plans without fear of our concept being further infringed upon. We are attempting to reach our fundraising goal by June 15th.  A donation of any amount will allow us the opportunity to move forward with legal protection and to address the issue at hand. Again, an Attorney has already been retained and rallying together makes a difference in our fight for creative Justice.Your support would make a world difference in the success of our project as well as the success of the contenders involved. Support the Arts by protecting Creative Rights. Please make your kind donation Today to help us with this worthy cause.

*** June 29th 2016 10am ***Last Sunday after a long weekend of events we enjoyed a very special evening of music, foodand fellowship on the landing on a hot summer's night. A seasoned out-of-townmusician. A up-n-coming local musician. A tired backpacker. A SoPo born-n-raised successful shop owner. A forlorn wanderer. A supportive neighbour. and Char. MAGIC !!!I am reminded of the gift that is Char's. The weekend beforeSolstice Arts Festival sponsored by the Arts Council was a treasure and we were pleased to be able to support through facilitating washrooms, tables, chairs, music stage in exchange for the much needed beverage sales. Last week summer run of 7 concerts in a row reminded me of the incredible support and encouragement we receive from the singer/songwriter troubadours. They come from all over the country and the world to perform at Char's for our stellar acoustics and listening audiences. The walk-ins for dorm style (hostel) beds is taking hold thanks largelyto word of mouth and the revenue from the guesthouse is thankfullyincreasing.One more step toward reaching Char's MIRACLE !!!35 letters of support of the zoning change were sent to City Council. We made it through the 3rd reading and now have a July 6th appointment with Dorothy Clarkstone Notary to consolidate the legal packages. Then we'll be back to City Council July 11th (hopefully) for final adoption, then to the bank. I realize the expenses are still growing. We'll have to re-register with Victoria, re-appraise, re-assess, re-finance. The list goes on so I am again grateful that the GoFundMe is growing. I have a MIRACLE folder and will produce a summary of the expenses for my supporters.Thank youfor keeping the dream alive! Charlene.*********************************************************** April 25th 2016 3:30pm ***1. $1200 to re-zone for re-financing2. $1000 for kid-friendly ammendment to liquor license3. $2800 for 4x$500 bunk beds + 8x$100 mattresses          to convert 2 guestrooms to hostel roomsCHAR'S MIRACLE $5000 reached in a mere 24 hours !I've learned that Club Char supporters have wanted a way to show their support so I'd like to leave this GoFundMe open for now... with my thanks. Charlene.*********************************************************** April 23rd 2016 3:30pm ***This is my first gofundme... I've arrived here in financial desperation... and I truly hope that when you hear the story of Char''s Landing, the heart of our community, Port Alberni, Vancouver Island, you will want to help.I am Charlene Patterson. Born and raised in the Okanagan, near Kelowna, BC, Canada. The 5th of 6 kids and family singing in 4 part harmony in the car on the way to church continues to be a happy memory.I graduated in 1979, then Vancouver computer consulting for 20 years, thenlived onCruise Ships running thecomputer department for 12 years. Stressful job but met a ton of wonderful people, was introduced to a multitude of beautiful cultures and saw incredible sights. I have been blessed.Retired and looked for a place where I could buy land near the ocean with a building where I could live and have a business opportunity. Through an incredible sequence of lucky cooincidences, I found this beautiful building right in the heart of Port Alberni's Arts District that originated as a First Methodist Church with first service August 4th, 1912. Moved to town April 1st 2010 and re-namedthe buildingChar's Landing. After 30 years working in aviation and the marines,I haveplanted my feet firmly on the ground.The Port Alberni community of 18,000+ welcomed me with open arms and inspired me to host concerts and community events.Fully renovated the building into my apartment, a 3 room guesthouseplus ameeting space with 150 person capacity. Employed/Purchasedall local and brought new life to the building, all new plumbing, electrical, heat, sewer, perimeter, painted the exterior, built a beautiful deck and ramp,created green spaces for a wide variety of flowers.I have been so lucky for the support and have really dug into my new community.During the first years I was asked to siton the board of the Arts Council, the board of Rotary and the board of the Chamber. I have been 100% engaged in the future of this beautiful community, and shared inthe transition fromit's mill town roots.It has been such an honour tohost travellers and to present singer/songwriters fromall over the world. They contact meto playfor our now well knownstellar acoustics andattentive listening audiences. I take such pride in what we have created and the joy that it gives.Char's Landing hasgiven me a life full of joy and friendship. For thisI am eternally greatful.However, April 1st, 2016 asI started my 7thyear here and sadly had the awakening that I could notmake payroll. Seems I have been living off my savings and investments and finally creditcards all this time. Month after month loosing money. Crazy I let it go this far.I was forced to lay off staff and cut any extra expenses. I decided to share my story and now I have asked the community for a miracle to keep our doors open.One big step ismy application to the City of Port Alberni torezone theproperty from commercial to residential, asthe primary use of the building is for my home. Residential status would allow me to apply for a personal line of credit, at a low interest rate, which would allow me to pay off my credit cards and 10% commercial mortgage. I'm currently paying $2500 per month in interest alone !!!TheCity Planner helped me through the application and the fee is $1200, which I do not currently have.So, I thought I'd ask thegofundme world if they would help. Will you help me, with my eternal thanks?Ibuilt Char's Landing to give me a life, full of community, friends, art, music. I am so very grateful to have thatnow but am afraid if I cannot get out of this incredible financial debt, I willhave to close, and disapoint the thousands that consider my 2000sqftliving room, their home away from home.Thank you forallowing me to share my story...

RIVERSIDE, CA                                




Hello!  Back to the Grind is a one-of-a-kind coffee shop in downtown Riverside. ""The Grind"" was founded with the goal to provide a welcoming environment for people of all kinds to gather, enjoy a pleasant and peaceful atmosphere, showcase their talents, study, read, or meet with friends and family. Since we opened our doors in April of 1996, we have stayed true to this goal, becoming a social hub through which countless friendships, opportunities, and collaborations are born. Back to the Grind is regarded as the artistic center for the City of Riverside. We have touched thousands of lives over the years and have housed the following group activities and cultural events:     . LGBT support groups     . Poetry readings     . Live concert performances from local and international      musicians     . Business meetings     . Collaborative art/music and dance showcases with local      colleges RCC and UCR     . Jazz workshops and performances     . Bible study     . Meditation groups     . Local political forums     . Local and international book signings     . Plus much more!  The years have been good to us. We are happy to extend a welcome to anyone who may not be familiar with us yet, and we thank you, our devoted customers. But now, after 18 years of loyal service, Back to the Grind asks for your help. We need to make major changes to the shop to become ADA compliant. Regulations have changed since we opened 18 years ago and now under threat of a lawsuit, we must respond or close our doors. Also, times are changing, and the shop needs to keep up. So we're turning to you. With your contribution, you can help us:     . Make our shop more accessible to the physically       challenged so that we can meet the ADA guidelines.    . Upgrade the electrical/gas systems so that we can      roast our own FRESH coffee on site     . Repair our cooling system and add an additional      system to the basement     . Acquire an oven so your favorite vegan confections will      be baked right in the shop     . Reinforce our back staircase and widen our mezzanine's      doorway     Help us continue to provide Riverside with top-notch service and an atmosphere where we as a community can thrive together! Your contributions will make these goals and dreams happen. Please help us get the ball rolling again so we can stay here to serve you for many more years!Thank you,Darren Conkerite, Owner of BTTG





""In the Age of Starbucks & the spread of American monoculture, Back to the Grind stands out as a bulwark against that rising corporate tide. This humble coffee shop & performance space is the hub of all that is vibrant and exciting about Riverside arts, culture & community. Now it needs our help. Consider giving the cost of a Starbucks beverage of your choice. Consider giving even if you don't live in Riverside, but you believe in independent, progressive, community-oriented businesses. Please do not let this precious space fade away.""   - Amber Garza, writer, zinester and long-time B2tG supporter

The Corner,"$12,053 ","$26,000 ",Creative," April 18, 2015",44,17,CINCINNATI,OH,131000,,3,"






                            MC Till
                            
                            
                                                           
CINCINNATI, OH                                





The Corner is storytelling for today. It moves kids out of their seats and into worlds painted by thoughtful literature and the rhythm of the spoken word. Whether the story is about a missing sock, choosing a book, or feeling left out The Corner delivers on storytelling like a modern day Shel Silverstein with a rhythmic twist.The first offering from the Corner is a book with an accompanying Hip-hop soundtrack on vinyl (CD/Digital Download too:) Yeah, thats right. We are literally making a vinyl record for children. The gatefold of the record will be the children's book. We are also working on ""The Corner Video Series."" This video series will feature ongoing quality video content for children that parents will not just approve, but appreciate.Will you make a pledge today and become part of The Corner? If you do, we have all kinds of cool perks over thereon the side ------>Now that we told you what we are doing and asked for you to join us let's go back a few years. We want you to know how The Corner story came about. Several years ago Vernard Fields called me (Adam Hayden) and said I'm making a children's album. Do you want to be a part of it? Of course I did. Like Vern, I love music and I enjoy working with children. It was a perfect fit. Then life hit. Marriages, children, a spouse w/ cancer, jobs, etc... The children's project was stuck in Greatideaville, NoWhere. Fast forward to 2012. I am working as an assistant teacher with Cincinnati Public Schools. Which, actually means I was the lead teacher a good amount of time. One day I was once again left in charge of a group of 25 unruly first grade students. I ran through a few explicatives in my mind. I kept them there. Then, I quickly grabbed a book of children's poetry. I started reading. I realized I could rap these poems pretty easily. So, I started rapping. And just like that the kids sat up with enthusiasm. That was that. Fast forward again to early 2014. I'm cleaning out a children's library. And what do you know. I come across that same book of poetry. And just like that the light bulb went off. I pulled out my cell phone and called my old buddy, Vern. You still want to make music for kids? He said Yes and we were off. Vern and I began meeting weekly. We would simply rap the poems from that book to some of our favorite beats (from producers like Pete Rock, J Dilla, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, etc...). It was great. We were having a ball. Soon, we tried it out on a group of 30 pre schoolers. It was a huge hit. The kids loved it. We loved it. The teachers were impressed that we held a group of 3-year-old's attention for 30 minutes! We were onto something special.

That's when I mentioned what we were doing to Matt Fischer. Matt owns and operates a marketing/advertising firm called Curiosity 360. Okay, I didn't just mention it to him. I asked if he would give me some input. He did! Then, he introduced Vern and I to his friend Charlie Padgett. The Corner was formed. Charlie is an illustrator who creates worlds for children to explore and their parents to do the same. His work is incredible, edgy, and altering. After Vern and I met with Charlie we quickly realized we were on the same page: we wanted to create children's content in the irreverent tradition of our heroes like Shel Silverstein, Roald Dahl, and Maurice Sendak. Stories that we would enjoy. Illustrations that intrigue us as parents and at the same time are engaging for very young people. Art that does not shy away from the conflicting humanity within us all, but embraces it, celebrates it, and wrestles with it. That is the essence of The Corner.The last piece to the corner puzzle is Larita Hayden. Larita is a living testament to embracing her humanity. She has survived cancer and is currently surviving being a parent to her two children! Larita is a licensed yoga instructor and teaches yoga to kids ages 3-17. She adds a warm, triumphant, and enthusiastic spirit to the heart of the Corner.Also at the core is an altruistic attitude. Sure, we have personal ambitious reasons for this to be successful. But, we want to make sure the success of The Corner is intrinsically tied to making this world just a little bit better place. To that end we have set up perks that not only benefit you, but your favorite teacher! Go one step further and help us gift financially strapped schools across this country with resources from The Corner. These resources include a book, a vinyl record (can you imagine kindergartners learning what a record is!), and a CD! These resources will assist teachers as they try to convince their classrooms that reading is cool and FUN!Secure your copy while passing along the love today!

Mary V Lives,"$3,619 ","$3,618 ",Creative," May 28, 2016",53,4,SUNNYSIDE,NY,382000,,,"

SUNNYSIDE, NY                                




I'm Rebekah Carrow. Two years ago, I lived in NH and was pursuing a career and then I decided to make a change. I didn't want to miss my chance to pursue my passions. So, I sold everything and moved to NYC to attend acting school at the Atlantic. After I graduated, I started working on Mary V.This play is about an ensemble of female actors, who arrive at the theatre to begin rehearsals on Shakespeare's Henry V. Little do they know they will encounter an ensemble of a male dominant Henry V production that is already there in intense rehearsals. The men cannot come to terms with the fact ladies are trying to run the show, and when a thespian battle of the sex's takes place the female cast is lead by Mary V. Mary is transformed from the passive pawn she was in the hands of her husband in Shakespeare's 16th Century original Henry V into a modern fierce, ferocious and feisty Amazonian warrior, who settles for nothing less than pure victory in this riveting modern adaptation. In 2016 Mary does not beat around the bush and is the one who wears the pants. Queen Mary is not afraid of a good old fist fight and when both sides refuse to back down the battle takes some ugly turns. These male and female thespians turned gangster artists are livid about having to share space and resources and about the implications their genders' have on their artistic expression and creative work.THIS PLAY HAD BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE DREAM FESTIVAL!!!Two years ago, I uprooted my entire life and threw my future into uncertainty for a vague vision. Mary V is a snapshot of clear resolution of why I made that change. I have given myself the lofty goal of expanding femininity on the American stage. Mary V will rip the stage out from under Henry V one board at a time. Our production team is very passionate about arts' active and crucial role in social activism.Therefore, because this play discusses violence between genders which brings to their mutual demise, we would like to take this opporitunity to discuss how peace between the genders could help empower women around the world and in the theatre world. Our production has been inspired by the HeForShe project, which is a solidarity campaign for gender equality initiated by UN Women and promoted by the actress Emma Watson. Therefore, the play will be directed by a male and female directors who are both NYU graduates.In addition, this production team will create a diverse cast and production team as an attempt to use Cultural Diplomacy to encourage men and women from different countries to create art and culture together in order to overcome prejudice and racism by understanding that communities around the world are facing a lot of the time similar challenges such as violence.Mary V is worth fighting for. Will you join her band of sisters?

                        Friends! Family! LGBTQQIP2SAA and all the Munchkins In between ! Help us build A GIANT RAINBOW!Our goal is to raise 10,000 dollars to fabricate a light weight, durable, tourable work of public art! In January of this year we built a giant RGB LED Rainbow, 32' wide by 16' tall! We blew audience's minds and melted their eyeballs with awesomeness in a production of the Wizard of Oz! Following the close of the production we asked to keep the Rainbow to continue to spread the love! The Rainbow appeared ata Galactic Roller Disco, followed by a brief appearance at a regional Burning Man event  Otherworld. Designed to be light enough to be suspended from a theatre pipe and flown, the Rainbow was originally constructed of doorskin, framing and coroplast. After two days in the rain forest at Otherworld, we knew it was the end of the road for the rainbow. We decided to burn the rainbow, danced naked around the flames and pledged to build a new one! Stronger, better and brighter! We will call her Phoenix.The Phoenix Rainbow will be constructed of structural grade aluminium, lit internally with approximately 600' of programmable RGB LED strip lighting and will be faced with a stretch projectable surface! The new cover will diffuse the light evenly and allow for incorporation of projection mapping during installation. We are working with structural engineers to ensure strength and safety and electrical wizards for hardware installation and programming!Our dream is to display the Rainbow in our communities, across Canada and around the world! Think Festivals! Parades! Skylines! Parks!

                                                                        Puerto Rican Cultural Exchange Project with Sweden 2016. We are three professional boricua artists. Specifically in flamenco, in bomba dance and music, and in contemporary dance. Over the course of the last 20 years, we have individually dedicated our efforts to each discipline so that we could develop our style and express it in front of our audiences. We are being provided a unique opportunity to internationally project Puerto Rican culture, and our art, through an invitation from Danscentrum Syd, Sweden, who have communicated their interest in having us provide educational/cultural workshops in Bomba, Flamenco and Contemporary Dance. This opportunity to initiate a Pilot Project, will permit us, as Boricua Ambassadors, to disseminate and fusion the disciplines that identify us, and create a language without losing the essence of who we are. Who We Are: Jossette Reilly Dancer and contemporary flamenco dancer. In Puerto Rico, she studied flamenco with Master Antonio Santaella for 10 years, she then traveled to Madrid, Spain, where she lived for a decade while studying flamenco under several Flamenco Masters, such as Cristobal Reyes; Mara Magdalena; and Alfonso Losa among many others. She danced in Flamenco Companies in Madrid, such as Las Cosas del Flamenco; and Amor y Odio. In 2006, she was a soloist in Ricky Martins  Live World Tour. Since 2007, she has been laboring in Istanbul, Turkey, preparing and directing Flamenco workshops and dancing for the Turkish audiences. Jossette has a B.A. Degree in modern languages, with a specialty in French, from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). Jossette Reilly y Eloy Ortiz Eloy Ortiz Dancer and choreographer of contemporary dance in Puerto Rico. He began his dance career with Ballet Teatro de Puerto Rico, where he was a Soloist. He then went on to join Ballets de San Juan, where he began his work as a choreographer. He trained in The Alvin Ailey School of Dance of New York, Broadway Dance Center and the Ballet Nacional de Espaa. Presently he is a member in the dance corps of Andanza, the most renown contemporary Dance Company in Puerto Rico, where he excels as choreographer and dance Master. Eloy holds a Bachelor in Arts Degree with a major in Psychology from InterAmerican University in Puerto Rico. Omar ""Pipo"" Sanchez Musician, Bomba dance instructor and founder and director of the highly talented and renown Bomba music group Son del Batey. Through his music, Pipo evidences his commitment to Puerto Rican culture, by keeping the music alive and by educating, without losing the perspective of our African inheritance. Pipo possesses an Associate Degree in Industrial Mechanics. Son del Batey The proposal consists in providing short educational workshops in the month of July2016, at various Schools, Universities, cultural centers and community schools in Mlmo, Sweden, for a week, commencing on the 16th and ending on the 23rd, closing with a free show on the last day. We understand that this is only the first step in exporting our Afro-Caribbean roots to other countries, given the interest expressed in the invitation to prepare and present these workshops. We are confident that in 2017, we will continue to consolidate and expand this socio-cultural exchange with Sweden and other Nordic Countries. We have recurred to this platform so that with your invaluable assistance we can achieve the $6,500.00 USD, total amount of funds required to cover the cost of airfare, lodging, food, and transportation. We realize that time is short, therefore, we are using this means to request your support in order to achieve the projected workshops, which we are sure are just the beginning of many more to come. Thank you for your support in this endeavor to be ambassadors and representative of our art and culture, through dance, music and its fusion, so we may be able to share and create new cultural relationships with new frontiers. Because it also happens, that the arts are our embassy, an embassy without offices, or diplomats, an embassy that is constructed in our memory.

Heather's dream,$770 ,"$1,500 ",Creative," March 2, 2016",18,6,CROYDON,PA,685000,,10,"






                            Heather Pursell
                            
                            
                                                           
CROYDON, PA                                




Hello, My name is Heather West. (Pursell). I am a single mom of three boys trying to raise money to start my dream job, which is lampworking (glass blowing behind a torch). It's very expensive to get started, and with being out of work since my stroke in 2012, saving any kind of money is out of the question. I want to go back to work in the worst way, but there aren't many jobs that allow me to work at my own pace and still make enough money for rent and other bills. I've wanted to do glass blowing since I was a kid, but never thought it was within reach due to the amount of money I would have to put out to start it. (Just buying a kiln alone is hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars!) The main reason I'm asking for help raising the money, (which is a really uncomfortable thing to do), is because I need to feel like I'm participating in life. I want to give my kids and myself a better life and be a productive member of society. I'm tired of being home all the time while I watch my friends go to work and then start hating myself because I can't. I want to go somewhere with my life not just watch it pass me by. Most of all, I'm tired of just dreaming about it... I need to start making things happen. If you're wondering what costs $5,000, I'll break it down for you.1. Kiln - a kiln is needed for annealing (or cooling slowly to prevent thermal shock so it doesn't explode) the glass. The size I need will have to be no smaller than an interior chamber of 12x12x12. Price- $1000 (with shipping and handling)2. Torch- Main tool for lampworking. Used to heat the glass for molding by adjusting flame with oxygen and propane mix . Can't lampwork without one. Price-$500 (the smaller ones don't get hot enough for borosilicate glass & $500 is more on the lower end as far as price)... some torches are $10,000 but I'm not trying to get all extravagant. Hoses and regulators are another $200-$3003. Tools- Absolutely necessary to make pretty much anything in glass flamework. Some examples of these tools are: jacks and other various tweezers (some to hold and others to mold), mashers (to flatten), reamers (to make clean holes through the glass), rakes (to pull down color onto glass), marving pads (to shape), blade sculpting tools (to sculpt), mandrils (what beads and small sculptures and buttons etc... are made on) ""hot fingers"" glass holders (easier to hold more of one side of the glass while working on the other side) , marble molds (for achieving perfectly round marble shapes), bowl pushes to create a bowl in the glass),Locking Hemostats (to hold smaller pieces with getting burned), picks and shapers (to pick and shape), diamond shears (to cut molten glass), glass cutter (to cut cold glass prior to heat), optic molds (to add texture and/or shape and design to glass), blow tube and corks (to add air to glass to make it hollow), Didymium lens glasses (so I don't burn me retinas lol)Price- varies depending on sales/company. Anywhere from $800- $2000 with all the above included (cheaper if I can get them in sets or on sale)(Just the glasses ... the cheapest I've seen is $70.00 and I'm not sure I can even find that price again)Also, there are many other tools used for this, but they aren't all necessary to begin. 4. Propane/Oxygen- needed to fuel the torch and a kiln if it's not electricNeed to be rented by the tanksPrices vary depending on company and size of tank5. Glass- borosilicate glass needed for glass blowing (haha)Some companies will sell glass by the rod or tube, while others will sell by the pound or the case. Pretty much where the rest of the $5000 will go. (I added $400 because a percentage goes to gofundme. )I understand that times are tough and I really have no business asking anyone for money that I don't earn. So, I would like to earn it. Anyone that would like to receive a custom glass piece from me and helps me to achieve my dream, will receive a sculpted glass piece personally made by me. For once in my life I truly believe in myself and know I won't just succeed, I will excel in lampworking if just given the chance. I have such a deep rooted passion for it. Just the past eight or so months, I've watched over a thousand hours of demonstrations and tutorials, learning everything I possibly can about every aspect of glassblowing and lampworking. From the basics, to the history of, to different cultural techniques and have learned so much from some of the best glassblowers in the industry. I'm so looking forward to starting this journey... I'd just like to ask if you'll help me get there. I can't thank you enough for even considering helping me. XOXOX,         Heather

Documentary about Homophobia,,,Creative," September 23, 2014",51,24,St. Neots,ENG,8000,,1,"

                        A UK Charity owner stood on stage in Uganda calling for the Death Penalty for LGBTs. How & why is this allowed to occur & go unquestioned?Please help fund this documentary against western backed homophobia in Uganda. Please give what you can & share  http://www.gofundme.com/dblawWestern evangelicals from the UK and US have been preaching hate in Uganda which has led to anti-gay legislation that has caused extreme persecution of the LGBT community and led to an increase in violence, rape and murder. It has also led to a rise in HIV infection rates as people no longer have access to health care.A new law promised as a ""Christmas present"" to the people of Uganda makes it illegal to provide employment, housing, transport and even health care to members of the LGBT community.Please donate what you can to help expose the murderous hatred of these western evangelicals and the vile propaganda they tell to the Ugandan people to perpetuate the hatred of and violence towards an already persecuted minority.The previous bill passed in December 2013 and signed by President Museveni in February 2014 was annulled by the constitutional court on a technicality (not the required quorum) in August. The MPs all signed a petition to bring it back and a draft of a new bill has been leaked. This new bill has been promised as a Christmas present (2014) just like the old one was in December 2012 and includes harsher clauses than the original bill and equates homosexuality to bestiality. http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/12/26/comment-can-you-help-raise-awareness-of-homophobia-in-uganda/ http://www.opdg.org/index.php/11-latest-news/49-a-need-to-raise-awareness-of-homophobia-in-uganda http://stopugandanantihomosexualitybill.blogspot.co.uk/Given the nature of the film I will be making, I don't want to advertise my travel plans or interview subjects, but I have a number of high profile members of the LGBT community in Uganda lined up for interviews as well as a few international figures. This is my first film, but I have been in contact with the Oscar winning director of God Loves Uganda for advice and support as well as a few other film makers. I also have a contact in Uganda who has experience in filming to assist me. My background is as a graduate from King's College, Cambridge with a Masters in Astrophysics. I plan to go into the history of homosexuality in Uganda and highlight the fact that the homophobia that exists there has been brought there by western evangelicals whose views are no longer tolerated in the west. I want to highlight the struggles and horrible situation for LGBT people living in Uganda in the wake of the AHA and show that despite it's annulment on a technicality, there has been a 2000% rise in homophobic attacks since it's passage in December last year. I will use the example of UK charity owner Paul Shinners to show that the charity commission is ineffective at dealing with complaints and regulating charities that operate in countries with a poor human right record. I have been following the situation closely for the past two years and have sat down and talked with Shinners and been appalled by his dismissive attitude towards LGBT people and the effects his actions have had on Uganda. People like him need to be accountable for their actions. I'm trying to raise what I can to make sure this project can reach it's full potential and do the subject matter the justice it deserves. It would be great if you could give what you can to help make this project a reality.Uganda's Constitution Court recently nullified the Anti-Homosexuality Act that was passed by Parliament in December 2013 and signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni in February this year. It was nullified by the court on the grounds that there was not the necessary quorum, as there were not enough MPs present in parliament at the time it was passed.The law which originally included the death penalty, which was removed at the last minute, imposes a life sentence on homosexuals. It also requires that parents, teachers, landlords etc. report any known homosexuals or face prison themselves. The bill also includes a clause that bans any so-called ""promotion"" of homosexuality, which makes any support or sexual health organisations illegal.MP David Bahati (the MP who originally proposed the bill to Parliament in 2009) has begun the process to re-table the Bill. According to the House Rules of Procedure, once the Bill is re-tabled, it will be referred to a committee where revisions are considered, brought back to the House for debate before proceeding to the third reading, which is the final stage before the Bill is passed.Over 250 MPs have signed a petition to get the Bill reenacted and a group of Christians led by their Pastor recently presented the Speaker Rebecca Kadaga with a petition over the nullified Anti-Homosexuallity law. Part of the petition signed by Pastor Wilber Mukisa said: ""We still need this law to help curb funding, promotion of homosexuality and to protect our people, especially children from being recruited into this dehumanizing lifestyle. We are behind the MPs who have up to have the law re-tabled in parliament. According to pastor Mukisa, now is the time for Uganda to look for genuine developmental partners who will value Ugandans and respect their culture.This is because no amount of Economic Aid can be compared to the values and well-being of our people and the destiny of Uganda in God, he said.The level of homophobia in Uganda has been rapidly increasing in recent years. This has been fueled by the anti-gay propaganda being imported into Uganda from the west. Despite zero evidence the Ugandan people are convinced that Homosexuals from the west are infiltrating their schools and ""recruiting"" children into homosexuality. They have been told homosexuals are pedophiles and prostitutes and that it is a learned behaviour. They believe it is ""un-African"" and is a western import, when in fact the aggressive homophobia and anti-gay propaganda is what has been coming from the west destroying the fabric of the Ugandan society.Desmond Tutu has compared the level of homophobia to that of the Antisemitism in Germany before the Holocaust. Western Evangelicals, who have been losing their war against homosexuals in the wast have turned to Africa and funneled millions into training African Pastors, particularly in Uganda, to preach against homosexuality and spread baseless propaganda to the masses. The death penalty clause was replaced with life in prison at the last moment, but before this there was still near unanimous support for the Bill, which was then known as the ""Kill the Gays"" Bill. Despite the death penalty being removed Ugandans have taken it's passage as a green light to commit acts of violence and even murder. Police have also assaulted LGBT individuals and some youths have attempted and committed suicide. Human Rights advocates Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) released a report detailing the increase of homophobic attacks in the wake of the bill's passage. The report detailed an attempted lynching, mob violence, homes burned down, blackmail, lost jobs, arrests, evictions and suicides.The survey recorded 162 incidents since the legislation was passed by parliament last December. By comparison, Sexual Minorities Uganda recorded only eight incidents in the rest of 2013 and 19 in the whole of 2012. [This] represents an increase of between 750% and 1,900% on previous years, the report notes, an increase which can only be explained by the passage of the AHA and the virulently homophobic atmosphere this has engendered. In four cases, men accused of being gay were kidnapped and tortured. There were 29 incidents where the media outed individuals who were later subjected to further persecution. A 17-year-old boy committed suicide by swallowing rat poison and pills on 3 April because he felt his life had no further value.In December 2012 Speaker Kadaga even promised the Bill would get passed as a Christmas present to Uganda. On New Years's Eve of that year a number of Christian events took place across Uganda. These events were dominated by a call to pass the ""Kill the Gays"" Bill. One such event was the 7th Annual Day of Prayer, hosted by Bishop David Kiganda...Bishop Kiganda was part of the National Task Force Against Homosexuality and has been filmed showing graphic gay pornography in his church. Prior to the nullification of the Anti-Homosexuality Act he said the following on his radio station...One of the attendees at Kiganda's National Day of Prayer was Cambridgeshire based Evangelical Paul Shinners. Shinners is the head of the UK registered charity ""Passion for Souls Ministries"" and he runs a cafe/bookshop called the Cornerstone Cafe in St. Neots, Cambridgeshire. He was quoted in a Ugandan newspaper as speaking in favour of the ""Kill the Gays"" Bill, but he denied this in a statement to the local paper and issued threats of legal action to anyone who tried to get clarification from him on what he said. He was consistently dishonest and lied and issued threats to anyone who challenged him.He went to great lengths to eradicate any copies of what he said in Uganda. One individual was even attacked for trying to obtain a copy. Despite being told the recording had been deleted from all the data sources in Uganda, I eventually managed to track down a recording of Shinners through a contact in Uganda. The video showed that the newspaper report was accurate and that Shinners had lied to try to cover his tracks and protect his business. The following video shows the portion of the video where he discusses the ""Kill the Gays"" Bill... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PshpkEkI7zIShinners traveled to Uganda as a member of River Church, a member of the Evangelical Alliance. Rob McFarlane, the leader of River Church, came to the UK from Zimbabwe where he ran churches for 18 years, where like Uganda, homosexuality is illegal and homophobia is widespread. Since returning from Uganda Shinners has run a church out of his Cafe with services on Sundays where he regularly preaches against homosexuality and ""healing"" sessions on a Thursday evening. His healing sessions consist mostly of exorcisms, which he calls ""deliverances"" and he claims to be able to cure anything fromCancer to Infertility and even claims to be able to cure homosexuality. He has been heard to say that he is ""like Jesus"" in reference to his ability to heal people.Shinners has enjoyed the support of his church and despite this video coming to light he still has the backing of the local papers and the Charity Commission, despite the fact he has openly lied to the papers and is in breach of the Charity Commission regulations. Due to lies suppression of the truth Shinners still enjoys a thriving tax free business, staffed by volunteers, under the umbrella of his charity. It has been business as usual and staff and customers either agree with him, believe his lies or are just unaware of what their money and time is helping support.The architect of the bill, US Pastor Scott Lively traveled to both Uganda and Russia before they published their anti-gay laws. He is the author of the ""Pink Swastika"" a book in which he claims the Nazis were a secretly gay organisation and is currently being sued by SMUG in the US in a landmark case for his involvement in Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act. Despite his private feelings even he had tried to distance himself from the bill, given the barbaric and draconian inclusion of the death penalty. Paul Shinners, however stood on a stage in front of thousands and was broadcast to millions over the radio as telling the people of Uganda that god was happy with Uganda for trying to pass the ""Kill the Gays"" Bill. He criticised Obama for his opposition to the bill and said they were making a stand for god, that Uganda would be blessed and that people in the UK were saying ""well done Uganda"". Paul Shinners has committed a hate crime. Calling for the genocide of an estimated 500,000 Ugandansbased on their sexuality is unconscionable and to do so by manipulating their religious beliefs and preying on their desperation and superstitions is sickening and disgraceful. This man and others like him need to be exposed and brought to justice and the individuals and organisations that can, but haven't taken action against him need to be held accountable and their cowardice and ineffectiveness highlighted.This Anti-Gay legislation needs to be stopped before it returns and the spotlight needs to be placed on religious charities that operate in these regions. Other nations need to see that this behaviour cannot continue in the form of political and economic sanctions. The homophobia and Anti-Gay legislation has began to spread with African nations falling like dominoes back into the dark ages. Most recently Kenya proposed Anti-Homosexuality legislation that would punish Kenyan homosexuals with life in prison and foreigners would face being stoned to death in public. This means that Ugandans who fled to Kenya after the passage of Uganda's harsh law would now face the death penalty. Also the Gambian National Assembly recently gave its near-unanimous approval to a bill which would impose a lifetime sentence upon conviction of homosexuality. A draft of the bill contains language identical to that of Uganda's anti-gay bill.I plan, among other things, to highlight the situation in Africa and use the case of Paul Shinners to highlight the ineffectiveness of the charity commission to regulate charities.

AUSTIN, TX                                





                        I'm Bob Cheevers from Memphis Tennessee having lived and worked in the pop music field in California for 25 years, the country music field in Nashville for 16 years and now living and working in the Americana music field in Austin Texas for nearly 7 years.I started writing songs while in college at Memphis State University in 1963. After college, I moved to L.A and started makingpop records for several of the major labels I had record deals with during that period. My entry into being a professional songwriter came in 1972 when I signed with MCA Music which was the first of half a dozen major publishing deals I had over the next 30 years. That was almost 50 years ago.At that time, I also became a performing singer/songwriter which is what I still am today. I've won an Emmy for one of my compositions called ""Big City Gambler"" in 1986 and am the 2011 Texas Music Awards ""Singer/Songwriter Of The Year"". I've played all over America and have done extensive tours of Europe 10 out of the last 12 years.I'm a working musician.Since 1997, I've released 10 commercial CDs all on several indyrecord labels including my own Inbred Records. Several of those CDs have done well in the Americana chart with two of them going to#24 and #14. My current release, ""On Earth As It Is In Austin"" is at #19 on the Alternatifve Roots Chart and climbing.Over the last nearly half a century, I've written over 3,000 songs and have selected 5 disc's worth of those songs to be on a retrospective album called ""Fifty Years"". Many of the songs never made it to released records and include a variety of genres/directions I went thru over the decades. The recordings were all recorded as masters, sound wonderful and show the depth and bredth of my writing styles, subject matter and production.This will be a comprehsnsive retrospective collection with compelling art work and a great behind-the-scenes look at the development of me as a songwriter.The money will be used to master the entire group of songs selected, create art work for the album, duplicate 2,000 copies and hire a record promoter and publicist to get the record out to radio and public relations resources.The selection process for the songs is complete and ready to send off for mastering after which will come the CD duplication and promotion campaign. All I need is the money to do this. In the past, I've put up the money to make all my records but at this particular juncture in my life, I don't find myself financially prepared to do what I think may be the most important record of my career. I honestly don't think there is a better ""package"" of music I can offer my fans and friends worldwide than this precious group of handpicked songs from my vast collection.So many of my dreams have come true. I feel that I've had a hand in pushing things along helping to make those dreams happen and, for the most part, haven't felt I needed someone to help me with that. This project, tho, is different if only for the huge amount of music it will offer...and I'm just feeling the need to see if the many many folks who have enjoyed my music and me as an artist would feel good about helping me make this epoch CD a part of my musical history. My personal mantra is ""Everything is always perfect"". I have a very heart-full feeling this is the right time for me to reach out to you to help me accomplish something that will really put an exclaimation point on what has been a career I'm proud of and for which I am eternally gratefull.Updated list of pre-order/donation gifts:$20 - Digital Download 50 Years and a Thank you on the website$25the actual Fifty Years five-disc CD (that's $5 a disc) and a Thank you on the website$50...the ""Fifty Years"" 5-disc CD plus a black engraved G7th Nashville capo(only 1 left)..and a Thank you on the website$100the Fifty Years 5-disc CD and your choice of any 4 of my other 10 commercial CDs. and a Thank you on the website$200...the Fifty Years double CD and all 10 of my other 10 commercial CDs. and a Thank you on the website$300 - Box Set of 11 albums and handwritten signed lyrics to a song of your choice. and a Thank you on the website$1000the Fifty Years five-disc CD, all 10 of my other commercial CDs and if you live in or around Austin...a house concert by me.

Bass Bug and the Watermelon Art Car,"$1,120 ","$1,500 ",Creative," July 16, 2016",31,2,Tennant Creek,NT,246000,1,12,"






                            Sean Spencer
                            
                            
                                                           
Tennant Creek, NT                                




Who are We?We are Froot Society, a theme camp from Burning Seed. We've evolved in 2016 from 'Juicy Carrots' (2015).Last year we launched our beasty creation/ art car - 'The Bass Bug' ft. Watermelon mobile cocktail bar.Basically we're the phattest, funkiest way to enjoy top-shelf cocktails and smoothies via our bike-powered blender!!!Rewards:Check out our wicked mug if you donate $25 or more let us know if you want us to post it to you or if you want to pick it up off our camp. $5 extra for postasge... What will the funds be used for?The Bass Bug took a BEATING at Burning Seed last year (temporarily re-named 'Battle Bug').So, this year we are significantly upgrading the whole arrangement. That means:1. Reinforcing the mechanical components of the ATV ie suspension and towing capability etc etc.2. Putting the BASS well and truly in the BUGG. That means importning a disgustingly phat sound system from the USA (currently unreleased in Australia). It's competition - grade audio gear; We have 2 - 12'' in subs, 8 six by nines, 2 - 8"" subs and three amps en-route. Over $2000 are allocated to the speakers and amps. Be afraid. Be very afraid. (AND PLEASE HELP)3. A good portion of the funds will also be used to fix the teardrop trailer, as it almost died after our Burn, and needs some serious reinforcement. We will only have to do it once, and the freshest cocktail bar on the paddock will live on...4. Travel. The Bass Bug is a seriously migratory insect. It's nest is in Tennant Creek NT and travels almost 6000 ks by the time it returns home in the desert. Help us get our beast from the Central Desert to the Seed.This has been a dream of ours since our first Burn in the States in 2009. 2015 was our first time with an art car at a burn and was our test year. This year means serious business,and this will literally be a dream come true. To see the smiling faces of people dancing to the beats of the Bug at Burning Seed while enjoying our watermelon mojitos will really be a sightto see, and one for all to enjoy!We will be ever grateful for your help in makingour dream come true, and im sure its something that Burning Seed will enjoy for years to come.

                            Jennifer Hazen
                            
                            
                                                           
CHIPPEWA FALLS, WI                                





                        Hello. My name is Jennifer and Im a recovering drug addict and alcoholic.Ive been clean and sober for 24 years but my sobriety doesnt erase my past or change that essential part of who I am. In fact, its a guiding principle in my life and has affected the majority of my decisions.One of the decisions I made in recovery from addiction and after my release from prison was my choice of professions. I am a licensed mental health therapist specializing in addictions. Most people know me as Jennifer Hazen, a name I originally took on Facebook to avoid dual relationships with my clients. The name Jennifer Hazen took on a life of its own and now I accept it as much as I do my legal name.So let me start again:Hello. My name is Jennifer Coyne and Im a recovering drug addict and alcoholic. I also sing in some bands and Im writing to ask you for your help.I work at a small, community-based, non-profit counseling center in Menomonie, Wisconsin called Arbor Place . Arbor Place is known, primarily, for its residential drug treatment center but we also offer outpatient mental health services, and we are moving into an integrated model treating both addictions and mental health in our residential program. Arbor Place sat on the corner of 21st Street and 3rd Avenue, behind Mayo/Red Cedar Hospital. It had been there for over 35 years. Tens of thousands of addicts and alcoholics have walked through its doors. Its old. Run-down. The linoleum was battered. There were white trails in the carpeting marking foot-traffic. It had 5 bathrooms for 16 residents. It was stifling hot in the summer and in the winter, in some areas of the house, you could see your breath. There were attempts at renovation, but in reality the building was just tired and, frankly, was limited in size relative to need.I started my career at Arbor and worked there for almost 6 years until moving forward in 2008. In November of 2013 I got a call from the director, Jill Gamez, offering me a job. In all honesty, I had no intention of accepting the offer, but I thought Id meet with her and hear her out. When I got there she showed me the plans for a new building. I was riveted. Like my clients, Id spent my career in battered, tired offices with faded carpet and stained industrial furniture. The idea of working in an aesthetically pleasing environment was a new concept. And providing our clients a place equipped with luxuries like bathrooms, temperature-controlled rooms, an exercise room, an art room, a garden and comfortable furniture was revolutionary. And doing this all while doubling our capacity and keeping the costs of treatment affordable is unheard of. You see, Arbor Place is the areas most inexpensive treatment center. Let me give you an example: Hazelden, an illustrious treatment center in Minnesota, is approximately $28,000 for a 28-day stay. Closer to home the costs range from $10,000 to $17,000. Arbor Place is approximately $6000. And Jills vision is to keep our costs affordable, despite the new building. I accepted the job and started back at Arbor in January of 2014. You see I, too, have a vision for our new center: The infusion of music into treatment.I avoided music for almost 13 years. Id decided music was a trigger. I believed that music brought flashbacks of my drug-using. That changed one day when, in my undergraduate program, after a long day of work my then 13-year-old-son, Toby, invited me into his room to listen to some music. Frankly, I didnt want to do it. I was tired. I had no interest in his teeny-bopper music. Still, wanting to be a good mother and be involved in his enthusiasms, I did. He played me Big N Rich and System Of A Down. I was electrified.In that moment I understood it wasnt all music that evoked memories of my drug-using past, just certain songs and genres. I dove into music, saddened by its absence from my life and desperate to make up for lost time.I believe music is important. It is important for our quality of life and important for the quality of our mental health. It walks as partner with us through our fears, joys, heartaches and triumphs, echoing, reflecting and comforting us in our lifes journey. It alters our perspective, lifts us up in times of need and, quite literally, changes the way our synapses fire. Music is valuable and must be a psychological need, since weve been making music since the dawn of time.Unfortunately, too many musicians succumb to the myth of sex and drugs and rock and roll as a path to creativity and happiness. And we lose talented musicians all the time. Im not just talking about Jimmy Morrison or Amy Winehouse. Im talking about people close to home, close to our families and to us. Many of them are out there as I write, slowing killing themselves with their sweet, deadly poison. We know who they are. We see them. We regretfully shake our heads. Perhaps well turn to our friend saying something like, S/hes got so much talent, too bad.Many people come to treatment with nothing. No money, no clothes, nowhere to live. Theyve burned their bridges and have no one to turn to for support. Theyve pawned their TVs, their phones, their microwaves and their guitars. I want Arbor Place to be prepared for that. Certainly many willand docome to Arbor with their instruments, but I want one of the intake questions to be, Do you play an instrument? If so, you are welcome to bring it in and if you dont have one, weve got one you can use.Id already developed my own music intervention group, now used at two area treatment centers, but I wanted more. I wanted to make our new Arbor Place the place our local musicians can go when theyve had too much. When they wake up and say, I cant do this anymore. Its killing me. I have to stop. I want them to know that Arbor Place is where they can come to get clean and sober and reacquaint themselves with their craft--their passion--without drugs and alcohol..As an addict I did terrible things and went to terrible places. I understand how addiction steals our very essence: it steals our morals, our integrity, our passion, our creativity, our honestyit steals everything that is good, right and real. And, as a recovering addict, I know that theres always hope. We can restore and remake ourselves in recovery. I know, because I did it and Ive seen countless others who have also done it.Now heres where Im busting myself out. Fronting myself off. Ive worked hard at keeping my professional life separate from my private life. The boundaries have been blurring over the past year and thats OK, because Im merging Jennifer Hazen and Jennifer Coyne, starting with this blog, in the interest of my passions: Music and helping people recovering from addiction.And heres where you come in:Ive initiated this Campaign to buy musical equipment for the new building and the Eau Claire area musicians and their fans have been incredibly generous. We now have a PA system, microphones, amps, a bass, guitarselectric and acoustic--drums and other percussion instruments.Because of their generosity we now have weekly drum circles (read about the efficacy of drum circles in recovery >here <) and yearly recovery jams. This year's jam will be on September 18th. My new goal is to buy some basic recording equipment and, perhaps in years to come, put out some Arbor Place recovery CDs. Because of the generosity of the musical community, we've already recorded our first original music, written by people in early recovery. I want music available to all our clients in whatever form suits them best. My goal is $6000. This will allow money to buy the needed equipment with enough to set aside for maintenance and upkeep. We will also continue to accept donations of musical equipment and MP3 players, all of which will stay in-house, for use by current clients.July 11th 2015 was the date of our grand opening celebration. It was open to everyone and there was live music from noon to 5:00. The last two hours were an open recovery jam and it was amazing. We're eternally grateful to all the musicians who donated their time and talent, making the event possible:The Eclectic Barn Boys with Randy Sinz, Gregg Wheeler and Johnny Lynch.Jenny and the Lost Boys with Jennifer Hazen, Jim Phillips, David Jones and John LeBrun.Jenny and the Jetswith John LeBrun, Billy Angell, Bentley Harder and Jennifer Hazenhosted the open jam.And local singer-songwriter, Yata , made a special appearance.Please donate. Its a good cause and your moneyand your trustis being used wisely and to an honorable purpose. If you want to donate equipment you can email me at jentoblues101@gmail.com and I can arrange pick up times.Thank you so much for reading.Jennifer Hazen Coyne.You can read more about the power of music to help heal addiction:Healing Power Of Music--BBC Music As Drug Who Needs Drugs When You've Got Music?

Hello my name is Laquita WrightI am A 29 year old Single Mother of a 9 year old daughterwho also go by the name Elle Unique the Artist. I traveled all over the world sinceI was 10 years old and I want to give back to the kids of Memphis. My mission is to help thekids of Memphis develop and discovertheir artistic gift andtalents. Families enroll their children in art programs for many different reasons. Often a primary goal is the development of a lifelong love of music and art. The study of music also brings many advantages. Music inspires innovation, self-motivation, independence, responsibility, and empathy, and opens a world of infinite possibilities and positive solutions to children. I want to take their dream to the next level by building their first portfolioby showing them the educational side to Art and handson such as appearances performances studio session photohoots etc.....HARD WORKDEDICATION ANDPRACTICE instill in themandat the end of the program there will be ashowcase. Parents take home kids portfolioand video just incase they are offer artistic opportunity they will be prepared. Students learn to generate original ideas and approaches, how to evaluate consequences, and to build on early experiences in their efforts to improve and realize their potential. The Art Development Program fosters creativity, innovation, and personal development. I am using the money to start a development program in Memphis to keep our kids out the streets; wherethere is nothing to look forward to for our kids they have my program instead offinding troublethey will discover theirgifts. I havea team who is willing to help mein every area from composing music, creating beats modeling dancing singing to comedians poets all and any form of art I have a mentor for each group.I build a team to keep these children out the street that isvery important because our youth aredying. Someparents have no idea their kids are talented and I want to be thatpush for parents to recognize their kids.This means so much to meas aartist I had a mom who took my craftseriously it kept me out of trouble and I had talented friendswho parents had no knowledge of their kids gift. Those kidsI grew up with are either dead or in jail and I really want my Art DevelopmentProgram to save lives; to come to life and I needhelp from you!!! Trying to keep the kids safe by keeping them busy and happy. With themoneyI will be able to allow straight A students in my program for free by affiliating my self with the honor programs in the city of Memphis. Shelby County schools are closing and activites are not in schools anymore. I will be very thankful for the help and to see smile on our youth faces. My music save lives and kept me out of trouble and I am here to help our Youth find their way only if I can come up with theFUNDS.INEED YOUR HELP

Tyler Clark's Record,"$2,195 ","$3,000 ",Creative," May 31, 2016",47,3,BAYVILLE,NJ,550000,,2,"






                            John Gilman
                            
                            
                                                           
BAYVILLE, NJ                                




My name is John Gilman. A week and a half ago, one of my best friends passed away. His name was Tyler Clark, though most of his friends knew him as ""Tito."" More than just an amazing person and friend, he was a gifted musician. Many people knew his music by the name ""Dead Man's Shanty."" His songs are a reflection of the person he was; a wise, rebellious, thrill-chasing dreamer with a giant heart. Tito took an approach to songwriting rare among manyartists today. He chose blunt honesty over marketability. He spoke his mind no matter how he thought people might react. His music was as real as it gets.



One of Tito's biggest dreams was to get his songs recorded and put out an album. He had a large catalog of music he had written, and plans for future releases, but he never actually released any studio recordings. Many of Tito's songs were taken with him when he left, but some were left behind unfinished.



A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to record seven of Tito's songs at my home studio. We recorded guitar, bass, and vocals, but never finished tracking the rest of the instrumentation Tito wanted. I feel a duty to him, as a friend (and a fan), to finish these recordings to the best of my ability, and put them out into the world.



The goal of this campaign is to raise the money to get into the recording studio and finish his songs, so that we can keep this part of him alive and share his gift with those who weren't fortunate enough to experience it while he was around. All funds collected will be used to pay for recording time and/or equipment used to finish these recordings. The songs will be professionally mixed and mastered and released with Tito's album art design. Old bandmates and friends will be joining in during the process to make sure we get this project as close to Tito's vision as possible. Any unused funds will be given back to Tito's family to help with funeral costs, etc.



I've never known an artist more talented, passionate, and real than Tito. I've never known a person more genuine and unique. This was his dream. Let's make it happen for him.

New Full Length Album  !,"$2,795 ","$3,500 ",Creative," August 29, 2016",29,27,RICHMOND,VA,217000,,2,"






                            Evan N McKeel
                            
                            
                                                           
RICHMOND, VA                                




My name is Evan McKeel, and I am a music maker from Richmond, VA! As a kid, I grew up on heartfelt, emotionial music from artists like Carole King, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, John Mayer, and many more, and began making my own when I started playing guitar around age 12! After honing my craft for many years, and gaining performance experience in my hometown, I was asked to be a contestant on NBC's The Voice.At my blind audition I turned all 4 coach's chairs around, choosing Pharrell Williams to be my coach. We had an awesome bond and relationship, eventually reaching the finals together! The show was an unimaginable time of growth for me, and I got to learn so much about music, performing, and the music industry.

Since the show ended I have been traveling a lot, spending most of my summer in the Music City, Nashville! My greatest desire since I finished up on The Voice has been to make new music; to make an album!There have been some crazy twists and turns, and I have had some opportunities come quickly, and get taken away quickly, but God has really lead me to the people I needed to meet and places I needed to be. I've made a great friend here named Evan Sieling, who is a very successful and gifted producer. Evan and I have been able to spend a good amount of time getting to know one another, and playing music, and we both feel very strongly that God has placed us in one another's paths to make music together. We want to shut ourselves in for a week, and immerse ourselves physically, and emotionally into making this record.These are all songs I have written with a great amount of honesty, some happy and hopeful, and some very painful. I'm putting a part of myself into this record forever! It's going to be a taxing process, as all creating is, but we are going to challenge ourselves, and I know it's going to be a very special week in both of our lives that we will look back on forever.We will need around $3,500 to make this record, which is about as inexpensively as you can record these days.The majority of that sum will go to paying my producer Evan for his work on the record, while $400-500 will go to paying another musician or two to come in and play additional parts.We are recording this album starting on September 12th, so we will need to raise these funds in the next couple of weeks !Making this record means the world to me right now. These songs are a piece of my heart, put into music about the things in my life that have moved me.This is going to be one of the most important things I look back on in this stage of my life, and it's going to make such a difference as I pursue bigger opportunities in music!I will be so grateful for your support. When I look back on this process, I will always be able to remember the amazing people that helped me make it possible!You only make your first album once!Thank you for being a part of my life and a part of my music!!Evan McKeel(Skinny-E)

Step Up To The Plate for Landis,"$2,580 ","$51,000 ",Creative," July 23, 2016",15,2,SAN CLEMENTE,CA,341000,1,,"

                                                            for CHALLENGED ATHLETES INC

SAN CLEMENTE, CA                                




Step Up To The Plate For LandisI have a new hero. Hes courageous, strong, and above all, inspirational.His name is Landis Sims, and hes only 11.  Landis plays baseball. He dreams like any other fifth grade boy would. He wants to play baseball in college and in the major leagues . Unlike your typical boy, Landis was born with Congenital Limb Deficiency. He doesnt have hands or feet.Born missing limbs, one would thinkLandis would be destined for a life of hardship.Landis Sims has never listened to people telling him what he could NOT do and his parents have never let any challenges stop him from having a normal childhood.By the way, dont feel sorry for Landis, he certainly doesnt view his own physical limitations as a challenge. Nothing, so far, has stopped him. I met Landis and his family a year and a half ago at a baseball camp for kids. At home plate, I immediately noticed a kid, batting, staring down the pitcher, and crushing balls into the outfield.It took me awhile to realize that Landis was wearing prosthetics on both legs and that he didnt have hands.I was awestruck. I had never seen anything like this, ever. I asked around, and found out the players name was Landis Sims. Since then, Ive had the privilege to get to know Landis and his parents, Amanda and Jeremy. They have invited me into their lives and have trusted me to tell their story via a one-hour documentary.One thing you should know about me is that for 20 years I have been filming natural history, expeditions, and adventure documentaries and have been the Director of Photography/Producer for over 50 films for National Geographic. Its not my style to tell you this, I only mention this so you know that this is what I do for a living and as moved as other stories have made me, I have NEVER been more touched after meeting Landis, his parents, his story, and have never invested this much personally in a project. I think millions of people can benefit from hearing Landis story.So far, I have been able to visit Landis home in Elizabeth, Indiana to do some preliminary filming for the documentary. Weve traveled together to Chicago and worked with a prosthetics expert Dr. David Rotter. Weve hung out with Landis heroes, the New York Yankees , and weve played baseballa lot of baseball. I was able to shoot all of this footage and finish Landis pilot with my own money, please see the link, Landisdocumentary.com. I WANT TO DONATE, WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?We need to raise $51,000 to get us started. Landis is meeting a crossroads. He has been able to play baseball at a competitive level until now. HE NEEDS A NEW KNEE. He has had the same knee since he was two, and although I know Landis to be the most courageous human being I have ever met, he is scared, emotional, and needs funding to make the trip to Chicago. This is the familys fourth trip to Chicago this year.In order for Landis to step up to the plate, he needs our help. He deserves to have his story told in order to inspire, educate, and prove to the world that you cant let anything get in the way of your dreams. This is why I am raising money for him, his trip to Chicago, and ultimately to help us film and share this compelling part of his story.WHAT WILL YOU SPEND MY MONEY ON?The money raised will specifically go towards the familys Chicago travel costs and expenses while they support Landis in his journey of receiving his new knee, Landis rehabilitation to learn how to walk again, any funds that he might need to attend the Challenged Athletes Foundations (CAF) triathlon in October where Landis will not only learn how to run again, but also will be indoctrinated into the CAF family.  Ultimately, I am hoping to raise the full $51,000 so we have enough money to not only support Landis but also be able to film this part of his journey. We also want to raise awareness for CAF and we have already partnered up with them and a percentage of the money raised through this campaign will go to CAF since their sole purpose is to help kids like Landis, who are limb deficient and have the desire, bravery, passion and courage to play competitive sports. CAF steps in when the insurance for these athletes will not cover their prosthetics. We have felt compelled to support Landis and CAF as we discovered that at the heart of every person (big or small, old or young) there is a passionate message that compels people to persist through the struggles that they are faced with.We have placed a great deal of our own personal investment but need your help. Many of us have experienced hardship to a certain degree, that moment where you feel like nothing could possibly get worse. We may feel weak, and uninspired, undetermined. But then we're reminded of the children who are incredibly generous, determined, and face adversity.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP If there's no way you can contribute to our campaign, it's ok, that doesn't mean you can't be a part of supporting Landis, CAF and other people that have limb deficiencies. You can still help us! Why not: Please share our campaign page on your social media, raise awareness about Congenital Limb Deficiency.Any donations are greatly appreciated. At this pivotal moment in Landis life and our project, we need your support.Landis and his family have shown me the true meaning of strength, heart, faith and sheer will. Their story is extraordinary please consider helping Landis and his family out.For inquiries about investing in the documentary above and beyond this initial phase, please contact me directly at ericscochran@gmail.comTo learn more about the project, please visit:  www.landisdocumentary.com Thank you for your support!

Gruesome Playground Injuries,"$2,265 ","$6,000 ",Creative," August 16, 2016",61,1,EAST HAMPTON,NY,285000,,2,"






                            Mary Catherine
                            
                            
                                                           
EAST HAMPTON, NY                                




Genny ProductionsIm Brian Clemente - the Director for our upcoming production of Gruesome Playground Injuries. Welcome to our gofundme page! Genny Prouctions is a brand new theatrical production company that is founded by myself, and other fellow graduates of SUNY Geneseo. This fall, we are kicking off our company with our inaugural production of Gruesome Playground Injuries by Rajiv Joseph. Gruesome Playground InjuriesFirst produced in 2009, Gruesome Playground Injuries, by Pulitzer Prize finalist Rajiv Joseph, tells the story of Kaylee and Doug, who first meet in the nurses office of their elementary school. Over the next thirty years, they are brought together again and again by injury, heartbreak and, on occasion, their own self-destructive tendencies. Its not your typical love story, and captures beautifully the complex relationship between love and hate. The actors performing this piece, Julia Masotti and Jacob Alden Roa are truly wonderful performers. Ive been lucky enough to not only act alongside them, but to also direct them before as well. They are two of the most dedicated people Ive ever met, and these are roles that have been on their radar for several years now. I am delighted that an audience will soon have an opportunity to see these two take on this very challenging play. The VenueGuild Hall of East Hampton is one of the premiere venues for entertainment on the East End of Long Island. They not only feature world class museum exhibits, and exciting theatrical productions in their John Drew Theater, but they are also an educational arts center for their community. I have been lucky enough to work on two professional productions there, and I couldnt think of a more perfect venue for this show. The intimate setting combined with the blunt theatrical atmosphere of the space creates the perfect setting for this piece. Gruesome Playground Injuries doesnt shy away from the harshness of these characters and their situations, and I know that the John Drew Theater will provide a perfect space for the audience to be truly immersed in its gritty beauty. Why We Need Your HelpUp till now, I have made it all sound very idealistic, but the truth is, it takes a village to put on a piece of theatre like this. Even though you will only ever see two actors on stage, there is an army of people working behind the scenes to make it all happen.Furthermore, there are many costs associated with any sort of production and this one is no different. Housing needs to be taken care of. Lights need to be on. Rights need to be purchased. And overall, the highest quality production needs to be presented. To do that, we need your help. And just to be clear, we are not trying to make any profit off of this site or this production. We have all missed working with each other and have come together to do this production for simply for the love of theatre. Our Gift to YouWe're trying to get our funds together by Sept. 23rd. No matter how much you give we will be sure to include your name in our program along with a note of thanks. In addition, for any donation of $100 or more, we would like to offer you TWO complimentary tickets along with our sincerest thanks. Your donation would not only support young artists like us, but also work towards strengthening the performing arts on the East End, in addition to the community as a whole. Tickets will be going on sale at the beginning of September, so be on the lookout for that, and many more updates. Thank you for visiting our page!

The Years by Cindy Lou Johnson,"$2,410 ","$5,400 ",Creative," August 25, 2016",27,1,NEW YORK,NY,301000,,4,"

NEW YORK, NY                                




The production of Cindy Lou Johnson's The Years!!!I am Basil Rojas and this will be the first full-length production which I direct and produce. I've been so priviledged to have been able to work with some extraordinary artists and directors in theater and who have taught me so much. It took a long time to pick a full-length piece for my directorial debut. I wanted to find something that would leave me thinking and would elicit feeling something, everything. After reading stacks of plays, I finally came across ""The Years"" by Cindy Lou Johnson and immediately knew it was the story I wanted to bring to life. It moved me and I believe it will move you. I decided to bring the words to life via my company, Sleeping Satellites Productions, in order to take you into a world where appearances aren't always what they seem.Now here we are getting closer and closer to the opening night of our three week run and I have learned that being an independent producer in New York City is more expensive than I anticipated. Theatre rentals are astronomical and paying all of the incredible artists involved for their time is not cheap.Together with the amazing Xandra Leigh Parker and her company, Brazen Acorn Productions, the show will be one that should not be missed but we need your help to truly bring it to life!Your generous donations will help pay for the lighting, set and costumes. Please consider providing support to local artists.We are truly greatful for your help in bringing this dream to life! Don't miss the show opening on Oct 5th!

                        Newberry Community Players was founded in 1972 to give community members an opportunity to perform in and enjoy live theatre in Newberry, SC. As most of you know we are a volunteer based non-profit group dedicated to bringing fun and exciting plays not only to our community but also to our youth through our Teen and Youth group programs.In 1974, the Newberry Community Players bought The Ritz Theatre. Keeping the building safe, clean, and ready for stage productions consumes most of the resources of this all-volunteer, nonprofit group. This current fund-raising campaign is focused on raising the large additional funds needed to restore the Ritz Theater to its former Art Deco appearance, fund additional programs (sewing classes, script writing workshops, costume workshops,etc), and performing building maintence.This year, The Ritz celebrates its 80th Anniversery! We already started facelifting our lobby and are in the process of starting extensive repairs on the building. Moving forward, our vision is to renovate The Ritz to become a multi-purpose venue providing entertainment to the comunity and a hub for community events.

We came here to sing. This has been our journey for our whole lives, and now it is our journey together.  For the past five years, we have been singing, writing songs, performing and creating The Real Sarahs . We have developed a beautiful body of work, in song, that tells the stories of our journeys, so far, and reveals the honest depths of our truths and our hearts.   From the beginning we have wanted to record an album. As we have cultivated a fan base, you, our fans, have also asked for this. We recorded five songs, three years ago, but now is the time to take this project to its natural progression.  Record a full length album - including all our best work, with the collaboration of our creative community.  Our plan is to get into the studio in the next two weeks to begin creating this album. Engineers, producers, studio musicians are all in place. The songs are ready.  This is an expensive endeavor. We will honor all the collaborators and creators by compensating them adequately. Musicians, producers,sound technicians and engineers, visual artists, etc. We will create this album the right way, and will share it with the world.  During these years singing together, we have supported many good causes, from local non-profits, to personal fundraisers to help with medical bills, to political causes. We have rarely said 'No' to a request for help and have sung countless times to benefit the needs of others. Now it is time for US to ask for YOUR help.We acknowledge the music we create to be a healing gift to ourselves and to those we share it with. We thank you, our community of support, for helping us all along our journey, and especially at this pivotal moment.Please help.Listen to our music! Connect with us on on Facebook!

                        Carrboro Elementary Theatre Troupe and the students as a whole need your help. We are a lucky school due to having an amazing Theater space to be creative and explore. The problem is that our theater lights have not been updated in over 50 years. With their age comes fire concerns, limited versatility and requires large amounts of energy. Our AMAZING PTA has graciously donated the seed money to get this project half way there. We would like to help that project see completion. Our children are amazing and every year 130+ students perform a full musical or play. Many of our teachers use this amazing space also and would love to see our students lit beautifully. Our school is set in the middle of a small community that loves and supports our school. We are a dual langauge school full of celebrated diversity. This year our students are performing The Little Mermaid. We are hoping to have all funds raised by October 1st and be able to install our lights for our performance. Our whole community would be so grateful for any support you could provide. Any donation amount and the sharing of our project is so helpful!!

                        I've been teaching millions how to build and work on cars for a decade and a lot has changed from when I first started. The biggest change has been the internet and how it allows us all to connect and learn as a global community. That's why I've had a vision for GarageInsiderTv.com for several years and have been positioning myself to start my own show online that will allow greater flexibility and engagement with the car community. I envision an online show that answers YOUR questions about building and working on cars and that's why we're reaching out to you for help in building this project. All money raised in this campaign will go towards finishing the garageinsidertv.com shop, camera equipment and promotional activity. The first 5 people who donate $2,500 to this GoFundMe campaign will recieve a guaranteed spot on the showSeason 1 of garageinsidertv.com(please email for details on the spot)

You can helpspread smiles among our youngest and most deserving of Artists!I'd like to combine my love of painting and bring opportunities to underprivileged kids in Sacramento, California.Theplan is to provide 3-hour painting classes for local kids in need. Specifically, children who would really appreciate paintingbut for whatever reason or circumstances, may not have many opportunities to do so right now.I'd like to work with the children who are living or depending on our homeless shelters, are in foster care, at low-income schools, and kids currently living in the Sacramento Childrens Home. 100% of the money raised will be used for foldable tables and chairs, painting supplies, table top easels, washable paint, and stretched art canvases that they will get to keep. Your name would also be added to a list of donors that would be shared at each event.They would have everything they need to get started. Instruction, additional supplies, and clean up will be provided. Many of these items can be cleaned and re-used, I just need help with the cost of the initial launch. Our first of many classes, has been scheduled in October.I am planning to work with large groups of kids and would like to be mobile and able to set up folding tables and chairs at any location, like parks, so parents can come along with their kids. There would be no cost to the parents to sign up their children for these events.Thank you so much for whatever you can contribute. No amount is too small. I am really excited about thisopportunity and it is very close to my heart because I love kids, I love to paint, and I know how much the children will love it to!If you would like to help, there isalso an Amazon Wish list set up so you can purchase the supplies directly and they can be shipped my way at:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2CR77W1R9JGZG/ref=cm_wl_list_o_1?Thank you so much for your support and please share this page with others who may like to help. I'll be sure to let the kids know how YOU helped to make their special day possible!  :) Thanks again from the bottom of many hearts.

My name is Tammy Stanley & I own Moonfish Studio in Austin, Texas. I am an artist, mom to Ella, ""soon to be wife"" aka ""my big love"" Misty Hillin, daughter tomy mom, friend & human who cares about other humans & the planet. I am also the illustrator of a book called Goodnight Austin. In the years since the book was published I have been manifesting taking my art BIG and it has worked. I have been working on murals & designing landscapes & upcycling all kinds of things & turning them into ART!My newest adventure has me working with some amazing people for a very special group of kids who are in desperate need of support, love and a sense of normalcy. I have been on many visits to see their unbelievable strength, tenacity and resiliency that most adults I know do not possess & who have never been through what these kids have been through. For some, this will be a temporary stay on their way through the system and for some, their fate has yet to be determined by others who are not their parents. { Announcement of the Austin no-profit organization will come soon. } There are not all smiles on their faces when I visit, that is my dream gift to them...love & joy through not only experiencing art, but CREATING it themselves with me and beyond.Come ""ART"" with us, through your donation and you could actually get to come get paint on your hands, as ""my assistant for the day"". I am creating 7+ murals & am creating a ""Make Your Mark"" ""studio, in honor & memory of my sweet friend Mark Kincaid, for ""freeform"" art expression.We met Tuesday 8/29 with the powers that be for a ""planning & design session"" and I went to my first orientation as an offcial volunteer last week. Tomorrow I will be finger printed by the FBI and once I get a TB test...I am good to go ART as I please.Through Moonfish Studio, I am donating all of my design work & time & some supplies, as needed. This will be the biggest hard cost expenseon these projects. I have worked since 1997 to establish my art studio & design to be able to give back and NOW IS THE TIME.For my first 10 donors at $100+, I will incorporate your name into one of our designs, not just as a listed name, but as ART :) YOUR NAME AS ART...I know, sounds cool, doesn't it?!?! There will also be a special ""VIP""mural that $1000+ donors can be involved in the designing & arting of.Thank you in advance for your generosity & support of Moonfish Studio's goal of ARTing BIG in ATX & beyond in support of my philosophy ""Only Love {art} Prevails""!PS: Still waiting on that $1,000 donor, I am designing the murals now....Maybe YOU will be my partner-in-ART?

                            Joanna McCormick
                            
                            
                                                           
OZARK, AR                                




Hello dear friends and family! Recently, the Lord has been speaking to me about my calling and future. The thing, as many of you know, that I am most passionate about is music and worship. I have been playing piano for a large portion of my life and I have been playing guitar for 6-7 years. Within that span of time, I have played and learned on guitars that do not belong to me - first on my grandfather's, then on my father's, and now on a borrowed guitar. At this point in my life, I am beginning to take my calling very seriously. I believe that I am called to be influential in not only the worship scene but also in the sphere of ""secular"" music. I believe it is possible to make music that is professional and appealing to a wide audience with messages that testify to God's goodness even in the midst of broken life. God has given me the ability to write music for both the ears of believers and unbelievers alike, and I am entering a season of developing that ability.

I am asking all who believe in this dream and calling to consider giving toward my goal of purchasing my own guitar. I am currently living and working as a missionary in Ozark, Arkansas for a non-profit missionary training organization called Youth With A Mission. I am supported by several individuals and families financially in order to do what I do. I believe in sending the incredible news of God's love and mercy to the nations, and music is a big part of sending that message. If you believe in and are likewise inspired by this vision, please invest in my purchase of an acoustic/electric guitar!

                        Hey everyone! My name is Owen and I am a 17 year old photographer.From the time I was a kid, I have always been different. I viewed the world from an outsider's perspective and normal social relationships never came easy to me. My peers had trouble relating to me and I often felt like there was a wall between me and everyone I met. After hours of therapy and psychological testing, the doctors diagnosed me with Asperger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of Autism. One of the major traits of Asperger's Syndromeis a difficulty functioningin social situations, and that described my life perfectly. On the other hand, my Asperger's has also made me very gifted. After years of struggling socially, I made the bold move to drop out of middle school and homeschool myself. While it worked out great for a while, homeschooling became very lonely andbymysophomore year, I needed a change of atmosphere.The scariest decision of my life was choosing to enroll in traditional high school again. I contemplated my choice for months and finally signed up to attend. As a sophomore transfer student, I knew very few peoplein my new school. It was atransition that would be difficult for anybody, but for an Asperger's kid, it is a nightmare from hell.After overcoming my nerves and getting comfortable in my new environment, I began incorporating one of my biggest passions into my school life: photography. At myfirst school event, I took over 3000 images and immediately uploaded them to my Flickr page and then posted the link on my Twitter page. To my surprise, within 24 hours, I had gained 300 followers on Twitter and manyof the photos that I took began to appear on my Instagram feed. People were coming out of the woodwork to befriend me and for once in my life, I felt surrounded by friends who appreciated my passion and were interested in me. This was something I had never experienced in all my years of existence.Now, almost two years later, I have photographed tons of events at my school and have more friends than I could have ever imagined. I am very grateful for all of my classmates who continually support me. They've even elected me to be their Senior Class President. While I will alwayshave Asperger's Syndrome, photography has enriched my life tremendously and has taught me how to flourish in social situations. What was once my worst nightmare is now something thatI look forward to every day.Today, I have expanded my photography far beyond the walls of my school. My work has been featured on billboards, in magazine ads, newspapers, and even in a recent issue of Sports Illustrated magazine.Why GoFundMe?I am trying to turn my photography into a business so I can earn money for college. My current camera is almost dead and I need a new one as soon as possible. The shutter life expectancy of my old camera is only 100,000 actuations and my shutter has well over 1,000,000 actuations. The new camera I want to purchase will allow me to get better photos in the low light situations which I am constantly shooting in. It can shoot many more frames per second, so I can take more pictures in hopes of capturing that perfect expression and it will also greatly improve the image quality when shootingsporting events. My photography is my primarysource of income and it is what I plan to use to help pay for my college tuition next year. Without my camera, it will be difficult for me toearn any money. Simply put, photography has changed my life and made me who I am as a person today. My level of photography requires professional equipment that is extremely expensive, butit is the only way I can continue to advance my career. No donation is too small and please do whatever you can to help me out! Click the blue links below to see some of my photography.With great gratitude,-OwenClick here for a sample of my photography! Here is my Flickr page, exclusively for the photos I take at my school.

                        The elders of San Pedro Atitlan in Guatemala are dying. The generation who fought in the revolution and survived the genocide of the 1980's are leaving us one by one.  I need your help to document their stories ina book, all of the proceeds from which will benefit their community. Their faces, their eyes, their hands have witnessed such a rich collection of stories, but without your help, these will all vanish: With the passing of Encarnacion Perez, whom you see in the videoabove, we've already lost yet another elder's voice. Fortunately I was able to record her story last year. While I have time to make the book, these elders don't.I have long wanted toto use my art to make a real difference in the lives of real people. With your help I can document the images, stories, and advice for future generations of the elders of San Pedro Atitlan in Guatemala.The money raised will be used to reimburse the participants, hire a Mayan language translator, and to cover my localcosts, but primarily to print the books in a local print shop. The books will all be donated to the local cultural center for sale to benefit local schools. Every dollar raised will remain in the community, and sale of the books will raise even more.My name is David Scott Moyer. I am a fine art photographer and painter living in Tucson, Arizona.I have been very fortunate to travel extensively in my work as a photographer, and have seen communities all over the world who are holding on to their traditions while being inexorably assimilated into the homogenous global culture. Please help me begin something with this one community thatI can then take on the road to other peoples. They deserve to be remembered, and together we can make it a reality.

                        My dad has a story to tell. In his 79 years on Earth he has been touched by so many Divine Intervention phenomenon that he never understood, that is until now. He has a book being published of all the experiences he has gone through, one more amazing than the other. He wants to share his life, his passion, his love, with the world. He is on the right track, but needs the funds to realize the goal with the publishing company. The funds go for copyrighting, editing, etc., all that encompasses a publisher to bring a book to life.He and my mom live a very simple life, they are not extravagant and they both go above and beyond for everyone they come across. It would be wonderful if others could pay it forward for them after all these years.He is a former law enforcement officer and has given his life to his community, to youth, and mostly to his family. He is the funniest man you will ever meet, and you could sit with him for hours just listening to his life stories - much to the chagrin of my mom.... just kiddingWe would love to see dad's book become a best seller and possibly lead to a second, as he has many more stories to tell. He has really been touched. When I tell you people stop him on the street and say he is a ""chosen one"", I am not exaggerating. Please help his passion and story, ""Divine Intervention, Why Me?"" reach all of you. Thank you from all of us.** as a special Thank You to all who donate $25 or more my dad would like to give you a signed autographed copy of his book once it is released.

                        What would you do if you were a mid-career artist and a multi-million-dollar technology company made your entire body of artwork available to its subscribers for download, transmission, display, copying, and creation of derivative works, like magazine covers - all without your permission?You would probably send them a cease and desist letter. But what would you then do if, in response, they hired a large Silicon Valley law firm to sue you and then tried to bully you into silence? This is exactly what is happening to me. Flipboard is suing me in Federal Court in the Northern District of California after I demanded that they stop infringing hundreds of my copyrighted photos. This GoFundMe appeal is directed to artists and their supporters, who believe that it is wrong to take an artists work without paying for it, and who are tired of being bullied and silenced by large corporate interests. I need your help and support now, both emotional and financial. Please reach into your pockets and donate $10, $20, $30, or more to help me pay my legal expenses and allow me to continue to stand up to this corporate bully. The Basics:I am avisual artist being sued by Flipboard Inc., a social-network aggregation, magazine-format mobile app with over 70 million subscribers. Flipboard is not simply a feed reader. The app allows for its users to take your photos and turn them into magazine covers complete with text of the users choosing. Imagine your photograph being used as the cover for a magazine complete with a magazine title plastered over your photo all with no payment to you or license from you. Flipboard did this in several ways in my case. First, by publishing my photos in their own magazine ""The Shot"" and further by accessing Flickr photos marked All Rights Reserved ""no downloads"" and ""no sharing"" in blatant violation of the Flickr API terms of service. On May 20, 2015, I posted my Glass Houses Images series to Bored Panda, using the site to introduce and explain my artistic practice and process and, in so doing, to generate interest and sales of my photographs. The Glass Houses Images were watermarked, included my copyright notice and were protected by it and the copyright notice of Bored Panda and its Terms of Service. The Glass Houses Images were registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. On May 28, 2015, I also posted my Mixed Signals series, unaware that my Glass Houses Images had already been taken by Flipboard. I only learned that my photographs had been taken by Flipboard when I saw them on a magazine created by Flipboard, called The Shot. I was not contacted about my work being used by Flipboard, or in the Shot, which displayed my Glass Houses Images on May 20, 2015, the same day I posted them to Bored Panda. My images became available for all Flipboard users to take, and make into their own magazine, without ever visiting my site or having the opportunity to contact me. Soon thereafter, on June 15, 2015, I documented that Flipboard had taken the entire contents of my Flickr photo stream containing 57 photographs. These photographs were clearly marked 'All Rights Reserved' and expressly prohibited sharing and downloading. My photographs that Flipboard displayed were full size and Flipboard presented its subscribers with numerous ways to share and use my work for themselves. The same thing occurred with the content I posted to my Tumblr. From at least May 1, 2015 Flipboard took my entire Tumblr blog and made it available for Flipboard users to ""flip"", essentially to take and share my photographs on Flipboard or Flipboard user's devices. More than three hundred of my photographs were used without my authorization. When I asserted my rights to my work, Flipboard began a campaign of harassment and sued me in an attempt to prevent me from asserting my artistic rights. Flipboard raced me to the courthouse to have their choice of forum (in this case, California), to deprive me of my choice of a New York forum and my New York attorney, and to create a financial burden to force me to settle the case. Due to the obvious financial disparity between a multi-million-dollar technology company andan individual artist, and despite the generosity of my attorneys, I must ask others who support the rights of artists to help fund this litigation. I am confident that I will win this case and that it will set a precedent for the rights of all artists in the digital realm. My case is very strong, but Flipboards finances are stronger. It is unfortunate that this is the way justice works, but Flipboard has the money to stop me as an individual. Currently, the case is set for a mediation. But Flipboard's attorneys have indicated in communications with my lawyer, that they do not intend to settle but instead intend to fight to the finish, unless I surrender. If the case does settle, your donations will be given to a non-profit organization dedicated to helping the rights of visual artists. With your support, I can take them on and take a stand for all artists whose work Silicon Valley thinks it has rights to simply because they create the software to harvest content. We see this type of behavior all the time in the music industry, but we need to start having the same conversation when it comes to visual arts and photography. With your support, I can advance this conversation. If your images have been similarly used, join me in the conversation. About Me: I'm a visual artist and photographer.

Mijo Mario / While I Still Got IT,"$1,385 ","$2,000 ",Creative," August 19, 2016",28,1,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,164000,2,10,"






                            Mijo Mario
                            
                            
                                                           
SCOTTSDALE, AZ                                




Hola, my friends! For those of you who aren't yet acquainted with me, my name is Mijo Mario. I'm a vocalist and guitar player from Phoenix Arizona, and I've been playing and performing music on and off since I was around the age of 10. At one time, I even played professionally in bands, and as a solo performer playing everything from Rock & Roll and R &B, to Big Band Jazz and even Country music! This is my campaign to raise funds so that I might soon be afforded the opportunity to record my music in a professional studio, and also hire a professional producer to help me optimize my performance and final product (Album).My musical journey novella:Once upon a time... there were days when I thought my guitar and voice were going to take me to ""Infinity and beyond!"" I thought I had life by the cajones (made in the shade) and I was sure it would only be a matter of time before I was making platinum records and headlining world tours. So, yeahhhh... fast forward 20+ years, and it didn't really work out that way. Lol.Anyway... for many years, I struggled with substance abuse, and suffered many losses as a result. One particular loss, was the desire to pursue anything that involved playing, performing, or even practicing my music. Sure... I pulled out the old guitar and greased up the vocal chords every now and then, and even had sporadic gigs along the way, but it wasn't like before. I'd lost the love. I thought it was gone forever and I honestly didn't care. My booze and anything else mind altering had become my main instruments, and ""playing"" them had become my craft. (For the purposes of this project, I'll spare you the crazy details of what followed, and how I lost just about everything else. But look for my next gofundme campaign to publish my autobiography. Lol)Fast forward to Jan 8, 2015. That was the day I decided to surrender, finally accept help, and put in the hard work and effort to leave my dark angels behind. So far, I've managed to put together a good chunk of sober time. Quickly approaching a year and 8 months!Somewhere between that life saving day and today, I began to miss my music. I started picking up my guitar again and enjoying the process of learning, singing, and even writing songs! Eventually, it was evident that I had rekindled my love for playing music, and I was intent on making it a permanent fixture in my life again.It took a lot of baby steppin' and hard work, but I feel like I've finally gotten my ""mojo"" back! Here's the thing though... I'm not getting any younger, people. Lol. The older I get, the harder it seems to be for me to hit those high notes and make those vocal runs that I used to execute easily. So... I'd absolutely LOVE to get my vocals and guitar playing recorded and digitized so as to capture every little nuance of the chops (skills) I still have left. Unfortunately though, right now... I'm not in a position financially to be able to afford the expenses. I've managed to save a few bucks, and I'm still hopeful that in time, I'll eventually have saved enough money to pay the studio bills. But a few days ago I was sharing my plans with a close friend, and she encouraged me to pursue avenues like this to enlist the help of others, that it might provide an extra financial boost to expedite the process. So... here we are!Ultimate goal:My hope is that with your help, I'll soon be able to record an album or EP (less tracks or songs than a traditional album) consisting of a few original songs I've written, as well as a few cover songs, and finally have an opportunity to see how my talents will translate using state of the art studio tools to record them. Some of the same studio tools that help the musicians we hear on the radio to sound so amazing!(YES!! You're almost done reading!)I am eternally gratefull to all of you who are willing to support me. Not only through financial donations (you can donate as little as $5), but through your faith and encouragement too. I'd REALLY like to have a finished product by New Year 2017, but I certainly don't want to rush the process. Just like life... recording can sometimes be a long and arduous process. But I truly believe that if I put as much work and passion into this project as I have done to get my life back on track... the end result will be something I'll be extremely proud of!Regardless of when the recording is completed... I'm making it a point to send copies of my finished product via CD or MP3 downloads to EVERYONE that supported me!Thanks... peace... and love.-Mijo

                                                Darius has been what we call a Ham since he was a little baby. Darius thrives when he is in the spotlight, which is why we are convinced that he would do well in a career of modeling or acting.Currently, Darius is in the Tuscarora Huskies marching band in Tuscarora High school. He plays the Xylophone and also plays several instruments in Percussion. He has also been a part of many of the church plays in Kids Choir and had several different parts to play from dancing, singing to the co-lead in his last play.Presently, Darius has a wonderful opportunity to attend an event in Chicago, IL - November 4, 5 and 6th called Launch showcase. In this arena, he will be performing, modeling and basically showcasing himself in front of hundreds of different agents who will see his potential and ability. 40 people were chosen out of 400 identified in the Northern Virginia area. He was one of them. The agents were looking for people who they say have something special. These are people that have an eye for seeing talent. However, with that comes a cost. At this time, we are seeking the assistance of families and friends to sponsor his trip to Chicago.The cost of the event is $1,800, plus airfare and lodging. Airfare and lodging are approximately $1,000. Any assistance that we can get to help us get him to Chicago would be appreciated greatly. Words would not be enough to express the gratitude that he would have to be able to attend this event.Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.First payment due September 30, 2016. http://launchshowcase.com/

                        I am an art therapy doctoral candidate, at Mount Mary University, working on creating a film entitled ""Bearing Witness: The Art of Pregnancy Loss and Infertility"" as a part of my dissertation.The study will include the creation of a short film and contextual essay about this topic.This film will be complied to explore what happens when individuals move their understanding of their trauma from its exploration in the private setting to the public realm.Selected interviews will be conducted from individuals who showed artwork about pregnancy loss, death of a child and infertility in a public space in 2012. They will be paired with an art therapist who will further process their experiences.It is my hope that this film willhelp educate professionals onethical considerations and therapeutic value of being heard/seen in art therapy trauma resolution. Italso may help raise awareness and decrease shame and guilt around the complexity of pregnancy loss and infertility.This study will add to the body of literature around trauma treatment and practices in helping clients work through trauma in art therapy. The intent of the study is to educate students and clinicians about the benefits and ethics around sharing work in a public venue. It could benefit students in training to learn about art therapy. It also intends to disarm stigma and shame associated with trauma, and to educate the public about the value of art therapy. The money to be raised in this campaign is to cover the cost of equipment rental, crew for filming, professional editing and transcription of the interviews, compensation for the participants in the studyand dissemination.In order to move forward with this research, the targeted goal for funding is hoped to be met by October15th.Infertility and pregnancy loss are very common. One in four pregnancies are lost due to miscarriage. Please take the time to donate to this important research to offer hope, insight and growth to clinicians, students and individuals impacted by the complexity of pregnancy loss and infertility, educating the public about the value of art therapy.

                        Hello Friends! This year of 2016 has brought about a lot of wonderful and exciting new experiences and opportunities for me. Since moving to New York City from Boston earlier this year in pursuit of a professional career as a composer, arranger and producer, Ive had the great pleasure and fortune of working with some of the most talented and respected in my field. And to add to this fortune (and after countless submissions and applications) I have been blessed with the opportunity to compose a commissioned piece for the Laefer Saxophone Quartet in London, UK! My piece will be performed in concert on November 15th 2016 at Crypt on the Green, and is hosted by London concert series and record company, Listenpony . Now with this great opportunity, I must see to it that I follow through, not only musically, but also financially - AND THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOUR HELP!  One of the requirements for fulfilling this commission is to be present at the concert premiere, which is happening this coming November! As you can imagine, planning for and funding a trip like this is overwhelming on a young aspiring music maker like myself, so Im turning to those whom I believe care and desire to support me in this wonderful next endeavor!For this campaign, my hope is to raise $2,500 to cover airfare (which is increasing every passing day!), ground travel and lodging. I plan to stay for about 10 days, to secure rehearsal time with the quartet and possibly attend other Listenpony events and/or pre-receptions for featured composers. The sooner I can raise this amount, the better! My goal is to collect all donations by Monday, October 17th 2016. Any kind of support is helpful, so please feel free to offer whatever you can!  I'm incredibly thankful for all of the support and help that I have had and will continue to receive from all of you! And I cant promise that Grammys will be won immediately after this trip lol, but I can promise that at 24 years of age, an opportunity like this will forever inspire and motivate me to pursue great things and bigger dreams.  So won't you help me build this London Bridge? Thank you so much for your time and ear to my story. I greatly appreciate all that you generously donate! God bless you!*

                        Hey guys! My name is Brandy. Believe it or not, I started writing in first grade with Frog and Toad fan fiction! I have always lovedcreating characters and crafting stories. A few years ago I decided to take the plunge and try writing an entire novel. I thought that taking the leap from short stories to full on novels would be a challenge, but what started as one book turned into a few!I have loved the writing process, and until now have kept my stories mostly to myself with the exception of a few friends and family members. I am now ready to take my next step, publication!With your help, I am ready to share my writing with the world! I am planning on self publishing my book this coming May, which means all the marketing and production costs fall on me personally. I am excited about doing the grunt work, but I need help with some of the costs to get this project going!Starting in January I will start selling pre-orders of the book, so keep an eye out for that announcement on my facebook, instagram, and twitter (@vagabee). Until then, I am starting this fundraiser, to get the ball rolling, and pick up the momentum I need to make one of my biggest dreams a reality!Here is a brief summary of what the book is about:Shael gambled and lost when he helped Luc form a mutiny against God. Now, not only are the rest of the Nephilim paying for his mistake, but so is his daughter Achaia. Only difference is, Achaia has no clue why her father has gone missing, who the Nephilim are, or that she's one of them. When Luc finally catches up with Shael and Achaia is left on her own, she has to decide who to trust. Which side will she choose? And which side will choose her?Thank you so much for your support. Even with all my love for words, they are insuffiecient to express my gratitude. God Bless!

HIGHEST PRAISE  Album Project by Heln TeikeDear Family, Friends and Colleagues,Welcome to my fundraising page!For so many years and so many times I have been asked over again when will you record your album? Well, I have good news! The time is now! I have also been asked how it is developing; and Im happy to report that seven out of ten songs have already been recorded! Many of you are also wondering when it will be released and how you can help. This page is dedicated for that purpose.Why should you invest this project? I believe I represent a huge group of people that have not seen their dreams realized yet and I want to be an example for them.My goal is to raise $25,000 by August 31st for all costs in producing this album. This amount will cover producers fees, studio time, musicians fees, singers fees, mixing, mastering, photography, graphic design, marketing, duplication, CD-release events (estimated this fall) and miscellaneous costs that go into making this a successful professional project.For most of my life I had feelings of unworthiness, felt limited, undervalued, disregarded, powerless, unimportant, had low self-esteem, and I didnt feel good enough. I let that cause defeat in my life. And so the years passed and my dream faded away, but here I am today, at 55, living my dream!If God did not give up on my dream; He hasnt given up on yours! Pay It Forward I desire to be a support to others, my vison is to pay it forward. If God can do it for me, He can do it for you! Proceeds from this project will go towards blessing someone else! My assignment and timing to record this album came as a surprise, I had actually said to God, thats it, Im not doing this anymore, if You want me to continue to pursue music, YOU do it! I had just started attending a new church and I was determined to not tell anyone I was a worship leader or wrote songs. My lips were sealed and my plan was to just attend the church like any other regular person. Well, if you know God, He is not going to let anything like that be hidden. We cant hide our gifts, because our gifts are not for us! They are given to us as stewards to share with others. My pastors detected my gift and encouraged me to pick it up again, this is your ministry, they said, and asked me to do weekly worship. Most of my songs have been living in a box on my bookshelf for many years. I know that is not what God intended when He so sweetly gave me these songs in the night as I was embraced and rescued in His love from hurt, pain and disappointments, or in the day as I was determined to make it through hardship and sorrow. He played and sang these songs for me, they were ""Heavenly Tunes"", so amazingly beautiful with orchestras and choirs, I must have been given a glimpse of what it sounds like in heaven! He also gave me the name of my ministry/company Heavenly Downloads, that was over 7 years ago just as downloading music from the Internet had started to be a common practice. Well, these songs were downloaded from heaven and they became my hearts solace, provided healing for my soul, freedom in my mind, gave me hope again and a reason for going on another day. Then through the most unimaginable circumstances and because of obedience of godly people the Lord put me in the path of an incredible singer/songwriter and musicians who drew out of me what was in me, and said, Thats it we are putting the devil to shame and we are making your album! Before I could really grasp what was going on, I had a professional management team supporting me, and an amazing producer ready to record my songs! I have also been blessed with a super professional group of musicians, a music director and superb vocalists who continue to support me to make sure this album is done in excellence and at a professional level, and therefore the costs are high. I know it may seem like a lot of money and that is why I also ask for your help to repost this every time you see it on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram or feel free to email your friends! I'm eternally grateful for every donation, big or small, as all of it supports this amazing project and will in turn bless the next person!THANK YOU for joining me in seeing this project come alive! IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO REALIZE YOUR DREAMS!Colossians 3:16Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.helenteike.com

My internet radio station, Pop Gold Radio, needs money toreplace the hard drive, pay for the labor of a computer person, pay for a backup PC, air monitor, mixer, headphone & headhone stand, and a battery backup in case of a power outage. Then there are thetwo monthly fees, one for mystreaming provider and the other to pay the extensive royalties required (I believe strongly that music makers and songwriters should be compensated for their work). There is also the domain name(s) twice yearly fees. $5000 is probably too low a sum for a goal, but I am being conservative with my expectations. If this amount or more israised, 1) Pop Gold Radio will remain broadcasting, and 2) Will remain commercial-free, funded by you, the listeners, and my dear friends. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart., date and time chosen by you!

                        Snubie.com has been my passion since 2009. It was started as a way to help people quit smoking by switching to Swedish Snus. In 2010, we launched a YouTube channel which has helped thousands of people quit smoking by switching to snus. Our website and YouTube channel are entirely self funded. As a father of two, that means there isn't a lot of extra money to enhance or expand our video production. This is why we are turning to the people who make Snubie.com what it is - the fans, our friends and our family. I never wanted to be in a place where I would make money from Snubie.com. It's why I didn't want to do ads. I looked into Patreon, but I decided against that because I don't want monthly income from Snubie.com, as this is my hobby, not my job. I want to be able to provide more content at a better quality for our viewers so Snubie.com can continue to grow and reach more people.Goals:1. Expand and enhance our YouTube studio.2. Attain better video recording equipment to enhance the quality of our videos.3. Attain better audio equipment to enhance the audio quality of our videos and podcasts.4. Attain better video editing/processing software.5. Enhance the performance of our computers for the purposes of video/audio storage, retrieval and processing.6. Overhaul the Snubie.com website. This is a goal that will probably be after we fund the first 5 due to the high costs of this.7. Finish construction of the Snubie.com YouTube Studio (this is beyond the scope of this campaign, but if we raise over our goal, this is the next goal).I immensley appreciate anyone who wants to help with this campaign. It means the world to me.

                        Hello! My name is Meagan Flaherty. I am a working artist living on Long Island, and have found mypassion inworking with children.I find thebeauty in the world around us, and live to inspire those around me to do the same. My focus in the classroom is always on creativity and on nurturing each student's underlying potential.The studio that I have been teaching out of is now closing, soI am trying to open my own! I have named this labor of lovesmallmark ART STUDIO, and plan on opening it'sdoorsthis fall. Classes are driven by creativity and communication. Students are inspired to pursue their own unique ideas and missions, and to communicate them effectively. Young artists can explore a variety of mediums and tools, and will create meaningful pieces of art, from concept to completion, through thought, focus and technique.I have spent a good part of this month considering my options, andhave accepted an offer toshare some space with my colleagues at the Jeffrey K Fisher Drawing Studio. It is the studio that I studied in, and the birthplace of my passion for the arts.I want this space to be energizing and fun, but I also need it to be safe and comfortable for everyone.The studiospace has beenbeaten up by years of professional adult use. The carpet is torn and messy andthe walls have been splattered and smudged. The studiodesperately needs new flooring, at the very least, and could use a few coats of paint on the ceiling, walls and windows. Really, it could use a complete overhaul, but I would bethrilledif I could at least get the flooring taken care of before I open the doors to the children. My budget is tight (the closing came as a suprise to me), so I have been trying to find used carpet or flooring to install myself. Ihave not had much luck so far, and am running out of time. If I can raise enough money,I would like to bring in a professionalto install some flooring before this months end. Any and all extra funds will be put toward a fresh coat of paint for the walls and ceiling, and toward new supplies for the children.This whole venture is so exciting, and it really means the world to me! Any help would be appreciated!Thank you for your considerations!Sincerely,Meagan <3

                        Hello!My name is Courtney Marnick, and I am the president of The ASU Theatre and Shakespeare Club, and the director of our production of The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde. This play holds a deep connection to all of our hearts as we have been waiting to do this production for over a year now, and it is also my thesis as a student of Barrett, the Honors College at ASU. As an organization, this production will be monumental to us as it will be our first non-Shakespearean production, and one we will really be able to pull out all the stops for to make it our biggest and best yet!Support from all of you would be so valuable to us, because it would mean we would would have so many more resources available to us and also it would mean a nest egg for our new executive board once I graduate.Please consider investing in this production, you will not regret it and we also have amazing rewards for every tier of donations and we will make sure it is well spent towards our goal of bringing classical theatre back to ASU and give our cast and crew members priceless memories.Sincerely,Your favorite Bunburyists, the ASU TheatreShakersP.S. We've found out that our campaign is eligible for the #gfmscholarship! So, if you're interested, keep on reading. Courtney Marnick, the director of this show, is an undergraduate at ASU in Business Marketing, and absolutely adores theatre (obviously). Now, why does this make her eligible for the GoFundMe Scholarship? Simply because that means more shows! Now in her senior year, Courtney has dedicated part of every year to the ASU Theatre and Shakespeare Club, and intends to continue to do so even after she graduates in May. Having the funds from the GoFundMe Scholarship would give her more opportunities to continue her education in a graduate program and further her knowledge in the entertainment business to continue to create art and help advise the organization after she has graduated as alumni advisor. Please share this campaign, so we can have enough people to donate to make it eligible for the scholarship and help to spread art and education!

FALLS CHURCH, VA                                




Hello! My name is Amara Galloway Forsley. I am seventeen years old, and a senior in high school. Ever since I was little I have dreamed of becoming a professional dancer. Id like your help to make this dream come true.My first step was to attend summer intensive programs. Now, as a graduating high school senior my goal was to be accepted into a professional trainee program. I cant describe how excited I was the day I found out I had been accepted into the Joffrey Ballet of Chicagos year-long trainee program! This incredible opportunity brings me one step closer to my dream. It means I will be moving to Chicago in September to train for the year with one of the top ballet schools in the country! However, the pointe of the matter is that this is going to be an expensive pursuit. Tuition runs $8,000 and rent will be another $8,000. Along with all that, my pointe shoes alone can cost more than $3,500. I cant imagine my life without dance! It is my favorite thing to do, and my love of dance has only grown as I have gotten older. I started dancing when I was three years old at a local community center, but for the past five years I have been dancing as a pre-professional student at BalletNova Center for Dance, just outside of Washington, D.C. I dance almost every day, often more than 30 hours a week.I have attended summer intensive programs at Rochester City Ballet (Draper Center for Dance),The Royal Ballet School of Antwerp in Belgium, Houston Ballet, Next Generation Ballet, and San Francisco Ballet, where I was awarded a full merit scholarship for their summer intensive. I have also competed in the Youth America Grand Prix competition for the past three years, placing in the Top 12 for my age category at the semi-finals each year. My mom is a single parent, trying to support my brother, who is a college student, as well as me and my dancing. It has been very difficult financially for my family since my parents got divorced, and my father is no longer involved in my life. I want to try and take some of the financial burden off of my mom, since she has supported and helped me so much along the way. This school year I was fortunate enough to have been awarded a full tuition scholarship from BalletNova. I also received scholarships from the Virginia Dance Coalition, and Eurotard Dancewear totaling $1,500, which I will use towards my tuition at the Joffrey Ballet. This summer I will be staying home instead of attending a summer intensive, so I can work to earn money to attend this year-round program.Still, it is not enough. A dancer needs supplies - especially pointe shoes. This is my fundraising goal. With your support I can continue to pursue my dream of becoming a professional dancer. Every little bit helps, and any contribution would be greatly appreciated!Thank you in advance for your help!Special thanks to Ruth Judson and Constance Walsh for the photos.

I am the son of Dr. Allen and Tommie ""Tonea"" Stewart. During my adolescent years I believed that I was an athlete, and I was pretty good. But there was another calling, I found myself in love with film and photography. At first it was just a hobby and in 2003 I began shooting commercials and promotional videos. Because of the success of those films I started StewPro. I quickly made a name for my self as a novice and sought opportunities to use that name to learn from the best in the business. I started as an Assistant Director on ""Finding a Good Man"" ( http://youtu.be/DFfpLrZ_k-M) with student Oscar winner Cassandra Henderson. I was Assisstant Director. for the exhibit in two civil rights museums, ""The Grenboro Four"" Greensboro N.C. and ""The Time Machine"" Rosa Parks Museum children's wing Montgomery, Alabama. Shortly after that I began my internship with Tyler Perry Studios and became a Production Assisstant. Then a camera operator for LMNO Cable Group for the hit show ""Deserving Design"", also ""Manland"", and ""Atlanta S.O.S."". Followed by the African American Museum of Philadelphia exhibit as Assisstant Director. These accolades are all projects that I am proud of but they are not all that I have done. When it comes to film, it has to have meaning and push the envelope and change societies. Otherwise its just something fun to do.Storyline Thomas Stewart is a father of a 3-year-old girl named Lauren. Married to Elizabeth Stewart a rising actress and graduate student at Penn State. The family moved to support her in Pennsylvania while keeping the family together. As a result he decided to go back to school for film. A Bellisimo Scholarship recipient, Thomas has proven to be a good student. Though life has been good for Thomas, he is reminded constantly that he could leave his home and not be allowed to return. Over the years the media has been reporting violent confrontations with police. Most of the victims of these occurrences have been young black men. Thomas has been taught by his parents the history of violence towards blacks. From Medgar Evers to Trayvon Martin black men have been targeted for centuries.  Thomas's memory of a police Officer aiming his gun at him at 12 yrs. old. Was the first unpleasant encounter with the police. His father has always told him to stay away from police, this has not always been possible. Thomas considers himself lucky to have survived as long as he has considering the plight of black youth. As he has grown the police and Thomas have crossed paths less and less. However the uneasiness when police come around still persists. He often wonders why he resents the police. As far back as he can remember Thomas has never appreciated the police presence.  When asked to pitch a documentary subject for class, Thomas decided to look into police use of excessive force. He turned to the internet to find some of the more recent videos he had seen previously. What he found was even more alarming. The police seem to exercise no discretion when apprehending black people. In some cases the police were brutally beating innocent people. Thomas cautiously watched as a man, sitting on a bench waiting for his children records himself being arrested in front of his children. Thomas decided to show this film during his pitch. After viewing a man being harassed, tasered and handcuffed by police in front of his children, Thomas stated in class that he would fight back. The professor asked,"" But you are a father and a Husband. You have been successful in your life. How could you risk losing it all by fighting the police?"" Thomas looked at his professor and replied,"" When does losing everything not matter anymore?. ""What about your daughter?"" asked Professor Dvir. ""I would rather she sees me fight than diminished."" Thomas has grown intolerant to the abuse of the police. Surprised by the professors reaction, Thomas has decided to research and document the essence of police brutality and his distaste for police. What is the correct action when encountered by police?  Elizabeth adores her husband and stresses that she hopes that the men in her family are not targeted by police. She is concerned that her husband may fall prey to police brutality. Elizabeth mentions the police not showing up when she called them for help as a child. She reveals her fear of someone targeting her family. Elizabeth fears Thomass reaction to this person would be explosive. This black woman expresses her fear of having a son. She is afraid that her son would become a victim of police violence, just like her husband and possibly her brother and nephew. Thomas heard this statement and wondered, how many mothers in this country have made that statement? Thomas, finds all of this to be disturbing. He questions the very fabric of the police. Thomas does not believe that he should even have to ask himself these questions. Should a woman be afraid to bare a child due to police violence? Should a father have to decide between the death of his families self worth or the fathers death as a martyr. To Thomas either of the two will lead to a negative outcome. So which of the two evils is best for his daughter? Thomas remembers stories that his parents told from the southern Jim Crow era. He contacts them and sets up an interview. During the interview his mother tells the story of witnessing her father, not beaten or killed but instead kept from drinking water from a fountain he had just installed. She tells her first hand account and how it made her feel. She explains I felt dirty and unworthy.. Thomas remembers hearing this story as a child and saying I will never let that happen to my children..  Thomas then interviews his father, when told the story about the young man pulled from a car infant of his children. Thomass father stated A cop should not even approach you much less taser you. Police were meant to protect tax payers property. That made Thomas curious about the police and there history. While searching for background information on police, Thomas located a man named Gary Potter. Dr. Gary Potter is a professor of online and on-campus courses for the EKU School of Justice Studies. His current research areas include transnational organized crime, human trafficking and the sex industry, and drug trafficking by teenagers in rural Kentucky. His extensive look at police in ""The History of Policing in the United States"" is exactly what Thomas is looking for. Thomas finds out that southern police were started in the Carolinas. Tasked with the returning of runaway slaves, this band of renegades later enforced Jim Crow laws. Those very same laws that forced Thomas's grandfather to stay thirsty while standing next to a water fountain he'd just fixed. Thomas has found a pattern. This is the cycle Thomas fear's will be repeated by his daughter. Thomas decides to take a look at police. They are trained to be life savers and heroes in the community. They are paid by the very people that die at there hands. Thomas wants to hear there side of the story. Although Thomas knows that all police Officers are not bad, he still does not trust any of them. He locates Ofc. Hamilton, a local police officer in Centre County Pennsylvania. He finds out that all police are taught to make it home at night and to shoot to kill if in danger. In danger could mean may things to many different people. It could also mean the person who kills you out of fear will show no remorse for the killing. If you are white and had no interaction with a black person, all you know of black people are negative stereotypes. You will probably be afraid of a black person. Thomas inquired with the Ofc. about the disregard for the children who witness the arrest of their father. All he has to do is what he is told.  Do what you are told. That cant be the answer. Thomas did not like the answer of the police officer and questioned the Polices authority to demand you do something and if you dont comply they will make you comply. He believes this to be a reminder of slavery. You dont have authority over your own self. Why doesnt this happen to people of other races? Why do black people have to submit to police or else. Thomas recognized this as white privilege. Thomas has only heard about white privilege through media. After doing some research he found an article on the subject. A women named Naomi Zack, a professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon and the author of The Ethics and Mores of Race: Equality After the History of Philosophy."" Thomas finds that white privilege has a lot to do with the deaths of black men at the hands of police. The simple fact that fear is the first excuse made by a Police Officer after killing a black man means that they are justified. Even if that fear is prominent in there deep rooted personal beliefs. What about Thomass fear of the police trying to kill him. Does that justify him in the court of law, would he ever make it to a court room alive? How would the justice department feel if blacks reacted in the same manner? The American Justice system is not designed to be biased and when it behaves biased it becomes oppressive. So what about Thomass little girl?  Thomas is beginning to understand that he cant teach his daughter if he is dead. She will undergo more harm if she witnesses her father killed or hauled off by police. Thomas has found the difficult decision his grandfather has had to face. Does he crush his oppressor and inevitably be killed for his retaliation? Or does he submit and become another victim of Police Brutality? Does his daughter witness him live through being marginalized or does he become a martyr to her forever? Its Thomass decision and only time will tell, which path he will choose?

Finishing costs for my documentary,$635 ,"$5,000 ",Creative," August 30, 2016",14,26,WINNETKA,CA,56000,,4,"






                            Mark DiNatale
                            
                            
                                                           
WINNETKA, CA                                




My name is Mark DiNatale, an almost 20 year resident of Los Angeles. I came out here with the dream to make films. Much of that took a detour when real life set in and the need for a job took center stage. But my love for film and video production never waived.I finally acquired my degree from CSUN in 2012, and decided to start recording family events. Since then I have recorded several weddings, parties, conducted lots of interviews, and created marketing videos for people to use on their websites, along with many school, and theater performances, but I have always wanted to make a documentary.It was about two years ago when the moment happened. I saw a documentary about the Asian hot sauce, Sriracha, directed by Griffin Hammond. I was blown away by how interesting this documentary about hot sauce was.Right about that time, a friend gave me an idea. he knew I had all the camera equipment, and knew I always wanted to make a movie with it. Sadly he moved out of state, but he says to me, ""Nostalgia"", and that was it. He let me take that idea and do with it what I pleased.Cut to 2016, I have a full 70-minute documentary completed. I wrote it, shot it, directed it, and produced it, by myself. When it came to the editing, social media getting the word out, that was all me as well.The film is called, ""The Business of Nostalgia "". it's fully edited, and has even been picked up to play in The Valley Film Festival on October 1st, 2016.I am asking for your help with finishing costs. The film needs to have the sound remixed, and I have hired a professional sound mixer to give it that professional theater sound. This film is supposed to be my calling card for future work and I want to be sure I showcase this project in the best possible light. That comes with a price, and while this person gave me an amazing deal, it is still something I need help with obtaining.The other thing that the money raised will go towards is something called a DCP copy of the film.This is the definition according to Wikipedia (DCP is a collection of digital files used to store and convey Digital Cinema audio, image, and data streams ). The theater is requesting this in order to play the night of the screening. The DCP also comes with a cost associated with it, and really the only cost that I hadn't factored in during this entire process.All this has to happen over the course of the next 21 days to make it ready for the screening on October 1st.The bulk of the work is done. I used my money, my time putting this together. I just need that little boost to help me get this film to be the best version if it that it can be. That is where you come in. With your donations all the money is going towards the final steps of getting this film ready for exhibition in a theater for a festival that it has already been accepted to.If there is any money made above the goal, it is going towards funding its release on Amazon Prime and ITunes in the early part of 2017. So no matter what amount you donate, any and all of it goes towards this film and finishing it or aiding in its wider release on streaming platforms in 2017.I am turning to those that have always encouraged me, cheered for me, and have wished me well. I feel real good about the film that I created, but just need that extra ""boost"" to push it to the next level. We can do that with your help and support.

If you cannot give finanically, I encourage you to share this campaign with others let your friends and family know about this project. Not just for the money, but I want people to be interested in the subject as well. I am hoping to turn this into a bigger idea that can be explored with a budget and a crew down the road.

I thank you for your time, and I certainly thank you for all the encouragement and support I have from many of you all these years. Let's help see this project though!

Help Bring Geek Music  to UNLV,$355 ,"$4,500 ",Creative," August 16, 2016",18,1,NORTH LAS VEGAS,NV,89000,,3,"

                        Hello,My name is Salvador Villa and I'm the Co-Founder and President of Mario Party Wars, a student organization at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas(UNLV) dedicated to promoting nerd and geek culture. We strive to show students and the city of Las Vegas the amazing things about being a nerd and a geek.That leads into why I'm here. We have been given an amazing opportunity to take the lead into hosting this years UNLV Geek Week. From Oct 31-Nov 3, we will have a variety of activities and events catering to different fandoms and other geek related things.One of the areas we want to cover is music. Nerd and geek music is hard to come by here in Las Vegas and although we have a few great bands out here like 3D6 and Time Crashers, we want to do even more. This is where Kirby Krackle comes in, a popular nerd-rock band from Seattle, Washington. Kirby Krackle specializes in creating songs based off of comics, video games, movies, and many other areas based on nerd/geek culture. They are one of the most diverse nerd bands around that we know and have great showmanship with some amazing music videos and great live performances:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxQqI7ROdnESince we live in Las Vegas, getting Kirby Krackle here would be a daunting task for one student org to handle and that's where you all come in. With your support, you can help us in getting Kirby Krackle to come and perform at our school during Geek Week. Your donations would help cover costs for transportation, lodging, performance fees, and venue expenses.We strive to be a dedicated organization leading the way to promoting geek & nerd culture in every way possible in Las Vegas. Nerd/geek/vgm music is something we feel isn't getting the support it needs here and we want to change that.We're still working hard and will use every resource possible to ensure we can get the funding needed to get them out here. This includes student government funding, fundraisers, & sponsorships. The great thing is we would love to turn this into something even more and what better way than to give back. If we reach beyond our goal, any additional funds will be used for future events and performances to continue helping promote geek and nerd music. We will also consider using some of the funds to donate to charity.As the leader of Mario Party Wars, I want to see us working hard and leading the way to make great things happen. I couldn't be more proud of what we have accomplished so far and definitely want to continue making an impact in people's lives. I'm a huge gamer and a geek that has helped make my life the way it is. I want to show everyone that being a geek or a nerd is great and that there's so much more to it than just games and books and such. It's a lifestyle that has helped me and can help countless others.

Own Jazmin's Violin ,$150 ,$296 ,Creative," September 22, 2016",3,3,VANCOUVER,WA,14000,,,"

                        When we rented the violin last year for Jazmin, they said the 1st year of rental payments could be used towards the purchase of her violin. We are at that year now so we have $303 In credit towards her $599 violin. So half paid for. It won't accrue anymore towards it so it seems silly to continue to Rent it when we could own it outright. So i would like to pay it off so it's hers to keep.

Produce an American original play!,"$2,010 ","$3,000 ",Creative," November 16, 2015",26,10,VALLEY VILLAGE,CA,121000,,5,"






                            Jill Hughes
                            
                            
                                                           
VALLEY VILLAGE, CA                                





                        Hi, my name is Jill Hughes and I am a writer/performer in Los Angeles. I am currently planning to produce my first play. The money will be used as follows: to pay the actors, to rent the theatre, to print the programs and to design & create the rather simple set.  I am hoping to raise the needed fundsby January 15, 2016 and to produce in March.I honestly believe this play could be anAmerican classic. I workshopped it a couple summers ago and it was magic. This play not only entertains but educates as the cast of characters are all (but one) famous American women who are no longer with us. Even though everyone knows much about these women, the audience will learn many more interesting details about themthey never knew as well as their connections to one another in life. Below is a short synopsis. Thank you for reading and helping me to entertain and educate!SYNOPSIS - LITTLE NELLS by Jill HughesThe play takes place during one day in heaven in a caf called Little Nells. The cafe has only been open for a couple of weeks and the grand opening party is that night. Little Nells is owned and operated by partners ELEANOR ROOSEVELT and SUSAN B. ANTHONY. Susan, no longer the strict Quaker woman, runs the bar with Eleanor, while running in and out of the kitchen to cook. JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS, no longer the ultra-private icon, rounds out the staff as an outspoken waitress with a sharp tongue and a keen interest in everyones business. Susan and Jackie do NOT get along. AMELIA EARHART, a chum of Eleanors, hangs around a lot, doing anything she is asked to do. BABE DIDRICKSON runs (literally) most of the errands for the cafe, and badgers everyone in her efforts to organize athletic teams for the ladies. Babe also does any and all manual labor and has a crush on Jackie. DOROTHY PARKER and her sidekick EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY sit at the bar to drink and crack wise all day, having something to say about everything and everyone. GRANDMA MOSES (no slouch herself in smart-assism) comes in to finish painting a portrait of the caf to be unveiled at the party. MARIAN ANDERSON, who is singing for the festivities, stops by to talk over song selections with her hero Eleanor. Marian is floored by a surprise from Eleanor: an introduction to HARRIET TUBMAN, who comes in every afternoon for tea. A moving scene ensues as Harriet recounts events from her amazing life. From not one, but two drop-in visits by a progressively tipsy (and lost) QUEEN ELIZABETH, to Susan and Jackie literally coming to blows, its never a dull moment at Little Nells. Eleanor, who means a great deal to them all for various reasons, is the human centerpiece as all through the day, her good friends and caf regulars come in to chat. Adding to the tension of party planning is the fact that Susan and Jackie are at each others throats for some very deep-seated, personal and psychological reasons. Lessons are learned on both sides before the conflict between the two is resolved. Facts about these historical womens careers and their personal and public lives are woven into the interactions with one another, not only entertaining the audience but educating as well. The melding of fact, fiction and fantasy tied together by divine common threads propels the action and keeps your interest piqued.

Greg Autry's book on Julian Ritter,"$1,170 ",$12.80 ,Creative," September 12, 2016",15,13,SAN JOSE,CA,114000,,4,"

                                                I am asking for your donations/gifts to raise funds that will enable me to complete my book about Julian Ritter, and get it off to the editor. Julian was a friend, and mentor, and one of the great artist of the twentieth century. I have dedicated myselfto write a book about Julian's amazing lifeand his monumental art. I'm getting close, and can use your help to get over the finish line. Please click `Donate Now.' Your Shares on Facebook and Twitter are also greatly appreciated.WHO I AM and WHY THIS NOW.As an adult, I worked to build a business and raise a famaily. I began to collect art seriously in the late 1970's and became enamored of the `Salon Nudes' painted by the artist Julian Ritter. My initiation into the world of art as an `Investment,' had a somewhat rocky initiation. Around 1982 I purchased an ""original"" Julian Ritter oil painting at a very renowned art gallery in Laguna Beach, California.             Artist Julian Ritter circa 1950I thought I had negotiated `quite the deal,' and also found that Julian was alive, still painting, and lived in Summerland, California (just south of Santa Barbara.) I was excited beyond words when I arranged to meet Julian and show him the painting I had just purchased.My first meeting with Julian was profound in many ways. First and foremost, I was delighted and honored to meet Julian and Laurie Kokx. Secondly, I found out that the painting I had purchased, was a fake. And NOT a very good fake at that!Restitution was made regarding the fake painting, and more importantly I started a lifelong love of a man I believe is one of the greatest artists of the Twentieth Century.I commissioned Julian to paint a portrait of my wife Yvonne, and later, another commission for a large painting in Las Vegas which is now well known as the `Las Vegas Fantasy.' I purchased paintings directly from Julian and in 1988, I purchased a collection of 28 paintings called the `Silver Slipper Collection,' from the Summa Corporation in Las Vegas, Nevada, when the Howard Hughes estate was settled after years in litigation.          `Portrait of Janet' by Julian RitterI met Julian a couple of years after my own father passed away. In addition to his art, I came to love the man deeply. I felt a deep connection to him, his work, and what he was trying to say through his art.   Artist Julian Ritter painting the `Portrait of Yvonne,'          1984, Torito Road, Summerland , CaliforniaJulian passed away, at the age of 90 in 2000, three days after my mother passed away. I had tried to promote him when he was alive, and after he passed, I rededicated myself to telling the story of the `Life and Art of Julian Ritter.' Thus the theme of the book I have commenced to write.It is around 34 chapters and 800 pages, in a rough second draft. Here is a brief description of three middle chapters from the book:`Renowned Artist Julian Ritter sat sail in the ""Galilee,"" leaving Santa Barbara behind, after the death of his beloved wife Hilde. Months later, disheveled, in jail in Acapulco, he was out of hope and out of time. His last desperate act, when given a chance to make a call from jail, was to phone Laurie Kokx in Santa Barbara, California. In a life saving attempt Laurie arranged a private plane to fly to Acapulco and to bail Julian out of the Mexican jail. Safely out of jail and revived, a month later, 60 year old Julian Ritter and 17 year old Laurie Kokx announced that they would embark together to sail to Costa Rica and on to the Tahitian Islands. After spending three years, living his childhood dreams of sailing the Islands and painting, Julian and Laurie hired another crewmate and would set sail for home, first bound for Honolulu. Within a couple of weeks however, things began to go wrong. The engine conked out, the radio was on the fritz, and lastly, they were caught in a severe cyclone, which crippled the 45 foot yawl Galilee. Their mast broken, severely off-course, no way to steer or to communicate, they were lost at sea,emaciated and within hours of death. Lost at sea for 89 days, the last 49 days with no food, they were miraculously rescued by the USS Niagara Falls, where upon the Navy Doctor, Lt. Phillip Becker, immediately had them taken to critical care in sick bay aboard the ship.' Sept 15, 1970, ""Galilee"" in tow byUSCGCCape Corwin,  and USS Niagara Falls, heading to Honolulu, Hawaii.`Sick Bay' of theUSS Niagara Falls, days after rescue of     Winfried Heiringhoff, Lauren Kokx, Julian Ritter.Brought back from the brink of death, Laurie and Julian eventually made it home to Santa Barbara, settling on Torito Road in Summerland, California. This is only a portion of what I've written to date, telling the story of a man whose life adventures, personality, and character at times overshadow his art, and who may be truly one of the greatest artists to ever have lived. Foolishly or not, Julian disdained the art world which he relied upon. He lived his life true to his beliefs and always in pursuit of his art.          Sept 14, 1970 `Galilee' in distress              ""NO FOOD, NO POSITION"" I made the decision to start the book, based on my intimate relationship and conversations with Julian over many years. He told me many stories, and we talked about art and his life's philosophy whenever we were together. Now I still need to do a signifcant amount of research. Part of the research needed to be done is about Julian's history in Las Vegas. Julian's `Golden Years'as I call them, were the 1950's, when he painted the bulk of the Silver Slipper Collection a well as having major art deals all overthe country.In 2015 I decided to move to Las Vegas, to do research and to physically start the book, while Sandy, my wife moved back to San Jose to be closer to her family. Thanks to the firm Sandy works for, who allowed her a transfer to their Palo Alto office. In Las Vegas I started and finished the first draft of the book, and began the second draft, the first rewrite. I also met a wonderful editor in Las Vegas, who is accomplished and is familiar with Julian's paintings that used to hang in the Silver Slipper.                        `Entry Piece'  Salon Nude by Julian Ritter - Silver Slipper CollectionWhile I do not consider myself a ""Writer,"" per se, I have been doing some writing. A few years back, while photographing a fashion show `For The Stars,' on Melrose Ave in West Hollywood, I met a publisher who liked my photos and asked ""If I write ?"" ""Of course I do,"" I replied. Thus Lawrence Davis gave me a ""job"" as a photojournalist for LA Splash Magazine. Writing for LA Splash Magazine does not pay, in cash, it has however offered me opportunities to improve as a writer, as well as other opportunities to cover events and meet people I would not have the opportunity to meet otherwise. Sadly, Lawrence Davis passed away in 2015. He had become a dear friend and I miss him every day. I continue as a photojournalist forLA Splash Magazine, in thanks to Lawrence and to continue my writing discipline.  Lawrence Davis - Splash Magazine Publisher 2014                    with Wilma EllesBuilding on the experience I've gained with LA Splash Magazine has given me the confidence to seriously pursue writing my book about Julian. I do it because I must. It has become my purpose, my passion, and I do it to honor a man who dedicated his entire life to art, and to whom I felt a kinship with, from the time I met him. In the face of dire adversity, Julian Ritter dedicated seventy years of his life to his one true purpose, that of creating art. Julian loved women without restraints, he loathed societies constraints and judgments, and sought to portray women as true Goddesses, without shame and full of joy.I am about half finished with the second draft, and will be ready to submit it to the editor. Right now I have thirty-four chapters, and a total of about 800 pages written. The second draft is about two-thirds completed, but I'm at a stop now. And STOPPED, is why I am reaching out with this ""goFundme"" campaign.HOW I WILL USE THE FUNDS1) COMPUTERS and EQUIPMENT        $ 4,536.00I have (had) two computers. A PC which I write on, and a MAC which I edit photos on. The PC Hard Drive crashed about two weeks ago. Thankfully I do have the manuscript backed up, on a flash drive. My MAC, is failing, and I am concerned it is going to crash also. Thus, the first component of my Request, to replace my Computer and related equipment.I will purchase a new MAC, and add Microsoft Word to the MAC, to write on. Thus I can continue writing, to complete the manuscript. Additional cost will include an Epson Printer, Set Up fees, and miscellaneous related items.I will not be able to finish the manuscriipt I'm afraid, without the funds to replace the computers.2)  EDITING THE MANUSCRIPT           $ 2,182.00Professional editing of the manuscript is required before it can be submitted to agents and publishers. My goal is to attain a deal with a major publisher, to publish the book in hardback. One, or possibly two volumns. Obtaining a publisher is another challenge, but for now, I must get the book finished. This is the goal here. I've selected aneditor, whom I believe will provide invaluable assistence and support. She has chastised me when needed, cajoled, and motivated me. 3)  CAMERAEQUIPMENT                 $ 4,023.00I must purchasea new camera, as my current D700 is approaching one-million shutter clicks. It has been in for repair twice in the last two years, and at this point the repairs will cost more than a new camera. It failed at one shoot last year, and I recently had to rent a camera body for a shoot, as the D700 is simply not reliable anymore.I've been shooting Nikon professionally since my first F3, when I was shooting fashion in New York. I will continue to shoot Nikon. This aspect of my `goFund me' campaign is to purchase a new Nikon D810 along with a wireless receiver. When I began the book I was making a living painting, doing art appraisals, and my commercial photography. I found that I could not do all three, and do them well. One had to be put on hold so that I could tell Julian's story.To that end, the photography became more important, as it was inherently entwined in what I am doing.As a photournalist for LA Splash, I photograph all of the events I write about. This I believe raises mycredibility as awriter. I believe it will be beneficial when I am seeking publishers for the book about Julian.I also use my camera when doing art appraisals, so as to include thumbnail images of the paintings appraised, with the written appraisal. This also goes to the computer issue (#1 above) for writing appraisals and editing photos for appraisals. Lastly, I shoot commercially to supplement my income andto pay monthly living expenses.My commercial work has fallen off significantly in the last year. This I percieve as being a part of the new digital world of imaging, but more importantly, as result of my relocation to Northern California. I am developing new clients and professional relationships here, but I must have reliable equipment. I am still shooting in Southern California, as well as Las Vegas, and traveling to shoot when requested.Here, I must thank my beautiful wife Sandy, for her unyielding support and belief in my artistic endeavors. Never has a man been so fortunate as to find a woman who truly believes in him and what he does. I cannot ask for Sandy to carry all the financial burden. I must work and do as much as I am able to contribute financially to our household, all the while working on `The Book' about Julian.4) RESEARCH FUNDS                      $ 2,052.00I do need to make a couple of trips to conclude some valuable aspects of the research, which will take me to Museums and Libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco, as well as Reno and Las Vegas again, and also to a town in Oregon. I believe both these trips will provide valuable information to bring together some of the final aspects of the concluding chapters for `The Book.'I have actually been working and doing the research for `The Book' for years. Going to museums, libraries, meeting people, and collecting stories. Even the art appraisals I do is part of my research. Including my time in Las Vegas I've spent an estimated twenty to thirty-thousand dollars of my own funds. Some of which has been offset by doing appraisals. I am NOT looking to recoup funds here for money I've already spent. I'll do that when I get a book deal.TOTAL and IN CONCLUSION             $ 12,793.00Asking for money is difficult for me. I first went to my bank for a personal loan. It seems banks and credit unions do not make personal loans in support of the arts, thus I was rudimentally turned down. Raising funds has become a necessity for me to completemy book about Julian.I have structured this `goFundme' campaign in the four phases shown above based on what I believe are the most critical aspects, first. I will apply fiunds received in the order listed herein:             1)  Computers  $  4,536.00            2)  Editor       $  2,182.00            3)  Camera      $  4,023.00            4)  Research    $  2,052.00            TOTAL          $ 12,793.00My love for Art, for design, for creating has evolved over a lifetime of experiences and people. Julian being the most profound influence on me, not only as an artist, but as a human. He spoke of `Spirit' long before I understood. He remains one of the most important influences on my life and in my perception of life. I feel that out of love and loyality both, this is something I must do for Julian. It is also an expression of what I believe.I am hopeful that the book will reach people all over the world. It is my dream that my book would be the impetus to talk about and understand Julian's work, his art, and his life's journey. It is my hope `The Book' creates a bigger conversation about Art, and the purpose of Fine Art as a tool for humans to express themselves. I want people to have an opportunity to see Julian's work, after the book comes out, in museums and galleries all over the world. My dream will be fulfilled by having Julian's work recognized as the great art it is. I'm very hopeful a producer or screenwriter will read my book and see Julian's work, and that the `Life and Art of Julian Ritter' may become the basis for a feature film, cable TV series, or a documentary.I'm also very hopeful of attracting the interest of appropriate art venues, such as museums and galleries, who would be interested in hosting shows and exhibitions of Julian's work.Julian was prolific over many decades. I have seen amazing works from collectors all over the USA, as well as in other countries, who have paintings and drawings that need to be seen by the artworld. This, I wish to facilitate. Paintings from the 1939 Golden Gate Exposition, the de Young Museum, and the `Bimbo's 365' collections, are but a few examples.                   `Atlantis' circa 1950        Bimbos 365 Club - San Francisco, California        `Steel Worker' circa 1938 study for Mural       1939 Golden Gate Exposition San Francisco        Mines Minerals and Machinery BuildingsWe are a little more than three years away, from the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the rescue of the ""Galilee"" on Sept 14, 1970. I will consider myself accomplished when I have fulfilled my promise to Julian, to let the world know that he was unique, and one of the greatest artists that ever lived.You can follow updated stories and posts on the Julian Ritter Facebook Page, as well as the Julian Ritter Blog, which I write and post weekly. At the Julian Website you can read some of the ""stories"" that are the basis for other chapters in the manuscript, andsee more photos of an array of Julian's paintings. To get an idea of my other interests and pursuits, take a look at some of my Articles in LA Splash Magazine . Of course there is an Article about Julian, as well as renowned Las Vegas Showgirl, Janet Boyd.My own, Facebook Page, Greg Autry, as well as my Facebook Page titled,`Greg Autry Art & Photo. ' are portals into my life of art. I Thank You now, for whatever you can do. Your gift is valued and is greatly appreciated.Greg AutryAuthor of the book - `The Life and Art of Julian Ritter'           `Las Vegas Fantasy' by Julian Ritter           Greg, Janet, Helen, Ronnie, and Teresa                    Greg Autry - Author            `The Life and Art of Julian Ritter'

                        Hello!As many of you may know, my life's ambition has been to write and publish a full-length novel. I finally have been able to pull it off, and finished the 350+ page manuscript! I have been using a content editor as I went along, who caught things that I've gone back and fixed, but once the book is complete, I have to send the entire novel to an editor no later than mid-October. They will work on the entire manuscript all at once, which, as you can expect, is pretty expensive. I need financial help to get this edit done so I can move forward and submit the book to agents and publishers so Grim Ambition can be released. If you can help me reach my goal to pay for the editor, I would greatly appreciate it.Lately I've been posting more and more about Grim Ambition. This book means the world to me, and it is my life, and hopefully, career if I can just get this published. Your donation can help me acheive my lifetime dream of becoming an author. Thank you for helping me!

Send Lucia to Circus Smirkus!,"$2,070 ","$2,000 ",Creative," February 9, 2016",32,7,,,89000,,6,"

Helpsend Lucia Mason to the 2016 Circus Smirkus Big Top Tour!Out of hundreds of applicants from across the US, Lucia was one of just 30 kids chosen to join the Smirkus Big Top Tour. As a Smirko Trouper, Lucia will train with renowned coaches, and create and perform wonderous acts. Plus, she gets to hang out with kids who are as crazy passionate about circus as she is! Youll be able to see Lucia in action by coming to one of the 65+ Invention of Flight Circus Smirkus shows across New England this summer.Lucia, in case you don't already know, is 17 years old, and has been climbing from the day she was born. For the past 10 years, shes been learning and performing thrilling and amazing moves on fabric, trapeze, rope, and cyr wheel. With the youth-led Traveling Rhubarb Circus (TRC), Lucia helps teach other kids aerials, juggling and acrobatics, and has choreographed acts for TRC shows and community events.Now comes the challenge for our family: the cost for Lucia to participate in the Big Top Tour is $6,500. That fee helps Smirkus pay for coaches, cooks, counselors, a tent & rigging crew, musicians, and administrators who coordinate homestays, logistics, and publicity. A large portion of ticket sales go to benefit the non-profit organizations that sponsor Big Top performances (for example, the North Star School, who sponsors the Northampton shows).This will be a life-changing experience for Lucia. We (Lucia's parents) are committed to making this happen, but are reaching out for your help to allow us to continue putting money aside for Lucia's college education. Your contribution will help Lucia's dream come true, while supporting circus arts in New England.Jeanne and Chris

                        Hello everyone,To the ones who dont know me, my name is Dash, I'm an Atlanta based photographer under the company name Digital By Dash. Over the weekend of June 3rd my home was broken into and my equipment along with other stuffwas stolen leaving me at a stand still. Some of the items that was taken and Im looking for help to replace includes my Mac Book, hard drives, camera bodies, lenses, editing tools and software and misc equipment and accessories. Some of my work was taken before I could give them to the clients,those items will never be replaced and simply have no value. So all I can hope for now is to replace my gear as soon as I can, and get back to shooting.For everyone who has had their photography gear stolen or anyone who has ever been robbed of something that is invaluable; we can agree that it is the most unexplainably infuriating and frustrating injustice. I'm hoping your donations can ease some of my distress.Thank you to everyone. I will greatly appreciate any donations, nothing is to small or too big. www.digitalbydash.com www.instragram.com/digitalbydash

OAKLAND, CA                                





                        Montera Middle School seeks funding to honor the campus's diversity with the completion of ""The Bamboo Corridor."" The tasks needed that complete the project are: (1) creation of a 7' X 44' mural on a section of the 400 building; (2) acknowledgement plaque for the participants of the multi-year endeavor.This is the proposal from artist Anna Vaughan:A mural to be painted on the 7' X 44' space that would be the size of the wall outside the art classroom called ""The Bamboo Corridor."" The mural will mirror the vegitation/bamboo and architecture of the school and will be executed using a combination of green tones and ombre color palettes, done in a similar style to the Abrams Claghorn Gallery Mural. The artful color and playful composition of the mural will provide students a space to creatively reflect on the unique beauty their environment. I will design and paint the majority of the mural and students will be invited to observe, ask questions and possibly participate as the mural is being painted. As an artist/educator I believe it is important to give students the opportunity to be engaged with the creative process of professional artists.Please see samples of my artwork and artist resume at annavaughan.com.The total amount of the grant is $3,200.00We would like to complete this before the start of our new academic school year 2016-17. We are confident with the sharing of this link we shall meet our goal soon. Please help continue our campus beautification projects. Our art building is off-white with no expression of color, this does not accurately represent our student body, we need to add color and life to our builidings to make this a more inviting campus for creative expression.This would complete a project that was started 2 years ago to cover the chain link fence these classrooms face to improve the look and feel around the classrooms.

I am who I am today  a pianist, a dancer, a composer, a lyricist, a hard worker, and I suppose an impassioned dreamer  because of my grandparents. So when they passed away, it was not only cathartic, but natural that I create a musical tribute to their lives and thats what started the eight-year sentimental journey to the here, the now, THE STORM. Jeremy Long, Composer and Lyricist [ABOUT THE PLAY & THE INSPIRATION -- Read More] With the groundwork laid and our professional creative team on deck, we are poised to take the page to the stage, but that requires lots of working capital. So dear family, friends, neighbors, staunch supporters, and all patrons of the Arts, WE NEED YOUR HELP to raise the needed funds.Concerning the General Budget and Timeline, the objective isto raise the initial capitalization to produce the show Off-Broadway, following a traditional path that will allow the stage show to prove its popularity with audiences before making the stiff leap onto the boards of Broadway. This will cost $3.5 million  a sizable goal. This is not an arbitrary number, but rather one that is based on the all-inclusive estimate of a theater management company  a powerhouse in the industry  associated and intimately familiar with THE STORM.Every dollar raised through crowd-funding will go directly to covering expenses for rehearsal space, theater rental, designers, union fees, actors, musicians, costumes, and scenery.As we move through the various phases of our fundraising campaign and start ticking off the boxes on our production checklist, we are committed to transparency and keeping our contributors in the loop with progress reports along the way so youll know how your donations are being put to use.The funding campaign will conclude on July 19, 2017. To be candid, it is likely we will fall short of our $3.5 million goal, but dont be disheartened. We want you to know that YOUR donation, regardless of its amount, does pack a wallop and helps create the momentum needed to favorably position us with potential investors who will underwrite whatever remaining capital may be needed to reach our goal. Dont forget  not even for a moment -- that YOU are living evidence of interest in THE STORM and that very interest is what will compel our investor angels to take us under their wings and carry us to the stage for what promises to be a truly Golden Opening Night!For the Intaglio team, theres no turning back and the show must go on, so PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A DONATION TODAY.

                        Hello!My name is David Stoeltzing, and I am an aspiring professional flautist. I was recently offered the incredible opportunity of attending the MasterWorks Music Festival this summer. Like other music festivals, MasterWorks provides attendees with incredible performance opportunities; as an orchestra member, I will have the chance to not only learn world-class repertory, but also to perform it each week. Unlike many other festivals, MasterWorks is a Christian organization, and it seeks to reach the community for Christ through excellence in musical performance. I would be involved in service projects, Bible studies with my peers, and a prayerful atmosphere of service to the Lord. I am a rather late addition to the festival, and the deadline for tuition is June 1st, 2016. This would be an incredible opportunity for me by equipping me with more of the tools I will need to serve the Lord better through music. It is an opportunity that I cannot afford without the Lord's provision; I ask that you consider giving anything you feel led to give. If you can only afford to lend me your prayers, I appreciate that immensely as well. I am ever grateful for the love and support that I receive from so many of you every single day. Grace and peace, David B. Stoeltzing

STOCKDALE, TX                                




Hi Y'all, For those of you who might not know me, I am from a small Texas town, who daughter of the one true king, a Mary Kay beauty consultant, and a DREAM. I may have dyslexia, Poly cyst ovarian syndrome, a blood disorder but, I am a baton twirler, dance teacher, and youth minstry volunteer. I dream of one day becoming a professor, dance/twirling studio owner, and a full-time writer. Yet, 2 years ago, I had to move back home to help my parents with our family business, took about a year off from school, and now, I am working 4-5 jobs to be able to pay for school and the various other expenses needed to survive. Most importantly, I believe even when you endure hurdles, you can jump them, keep the faith, and be what you have overcome! 3 years ago, I set out on a journey to have a book published. I never realized, last October my dream of having a book published, actually came through with the publication of Into Her World. The support and encouragement of telling the story of a small town girl's world, inspired by my life in Texas and in Australia, has been overwhelming. I owe a HUGE thank you to my forward writer, Amber Rhyne Hanel, who has been with me every step of they way and been a huge part to having J Ko to life! Yet, what many do not realize is the finanical aspects my family and I have had to endure. I never realized the finanical hardship my family and I would have to go through. In order to publish the book, I went through Trafford, a self-publishing company which means, the AUTHOR MUST PAY FOR ALL EXPENSES OF THE BOOK'S PUBLICATION. Let's just say, the publication and marketing for Into Her World has cost over $7,000. Little does the world realize, the toll and debt I've put my family in. Throughout my life, all I have wanted to do was to help make my family proud and allow my writings to connect with others who have experienced similar situations I have been in. When I first began my writing venture, I did not realize the reactions it would have to actually bring Into Her World to life. Over the past 8 months, I have been praying I could find a way to repay my parents back for their help and be able to help my writing career become successful so I can continue to help my family out finanically and have the opportunity to share Into Her World with others, be picked up by a larger publisher, and take writing talents I have been given from God thus, being able to share my faith. This coming Sept. 23-26, I have been one of the 10 Trafford Authors selected to represent the company and have the opportunity to meet eager readers at the 2016 Word on the Street Book Fest- Canada's largest book festivals and one of North America's largest. Getting to go to Toronto is just a dream come true BUT to be able to partake in Word on the Street is nearly an answer to my prayers. Yes, I am STOKED HOWEVER, finanically, to be able to participate, I need HELP. For most authors, their publishing companies help them financially and most of their trips such as signings and book festivals. However, for Trafford/Author Solution authors, everything comes out of our pockets. I know, I usually don't ask for help but, this time, through the encouragement of some avid J. Ko fans, I have decided to swallow my pride and seek your help J. Ko fans! In order to even to fully commit to my invitation, I will need to be able to raise at least $3500 in funds by August 12, 2016. As of now, I have been able to secure my flight, thanks to frequent flyer miles but, I will still need to have Book Fest fees and hotel fees to be covered. Unfortunately, do to working 3 jobs, helping cover medical expenses, a family mortage, school, and other expenses going on, being able to cover the costs of the trip, seems impossible. J. Ko readers and supporters, I hope it's not too much to ask for your help or if you cared to share the info with anyone who might be willing to help support my cause, that would mean so much to me! My goal may be $3500 but, any financial help and prayers will be accepted with an open heart! I am offering an incentive to those who donate!

If you donate At least $25, you'll receive a paperback edition of Into Her World personalized and autographed! Donate $40 dollars of more, receive you'll receive a hardcover autographed copy! Donate $50 or more, receive 2 copies, your choice of binding, with autographs! Please know, even if you give $1, I'll be beyond thankful!! So Team J Ko and Team Teal Dreamers, what do you say to following dreams, never stop believing, and reaching for the stars? Can you get us to the Queen City of Canada? NOW's your chance!! Regardless of things, your support, prayers, and friendships mean the world to me. I am thankful that y'all continue to believe in my dream of being able to share with the world that no matter where you come from or what you've endure, tell your story because you NEVER know the light you are able be for another! Know, in supporting me, you're more than just a supporter, you are a part of my family, which means the world to me! In all I do, I am doing this for my Aunt Lila, who passed away at the beginning of year, for my family, and those little J Ko's who are waiting to have their voices heard!!

                        Our goal is to collect 5dollar from 50,000 people to help us reach our budget. #DollarandAFlickCampaign #BlackButterflyMy name is Tony Lloyd, the writer and director of the romance/drama ""Black Butterfly."" I have been wanting to be a filmmaker my whole life. Experiencing movies like E.T., Back to the Future, Glory, and everything Eddie Murphy put out in the 80's and 90's, made it clear to me what I was put on this earth to do. The process of becoming a filmmaker is, in one aspect, humbling for all the sacrifices you have to endure. It is also the ultimate test of your passion and love for the art. There is no greater feeling to me than to create a story out of a vision in your brain, add a visual to that story then place it on a screen to entertain the world. The power to evoke emotion out of someone that can relate to your story is to me, therapy for those who need it and also for those who didn't think they needed it. My goal is to be mentioned among the great directors. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Spike Lee, Oliver Stone, Antoine Fuqua. I can go on, but I believe the ideas and visions I have for future projects will certainly impress my predecessors. Carrying the torch by delivering great stories and visual experiences to the world. This is all I ever wanted to do and with the help of my team, my prayers and ambitions are finally coming to fruition. Thank you!GOD BLESS

Hello everybody! We cannot tell you how excited we are to get this album to you and we are soooo close! As I'm sure you all know- nothing about recording is cheap and the costs never end up being what you think they are going to be.We are literally less than a week away from mixing, andgot word of more unexpected costs we need to pay in order to finish. Two thousand is what need on the table by next week in order to finish-andif we can raise more than that, we will spend the money on other merchandise, such as t shirts and stickers. We have spent every penny we have saved from gigs, fundraising, and a lot of personal money on this labor of love.The reality is, we have reached the bottom of the pocket book and we cannot finish this without the help of YOU-our amazing friends, fans and family. It is chalk full of amazing guest musicians such as Gregory Alan Isakov, Stu Miller, Haley Rydell, Jon Wirtz and Trevor Minton. We also had a crew of incredible musicians and friends who donated time in the studio to sing the end of ""let love be the light"" with us.This album is about celebrating life, helping others and being true to who you are- so here's to hoping ""Beautiful and True"" finds it's way to press<3We really hope to be able to have it ready for the CD celebration on the 21st of May, but in order to do that we have to act fast. I believe that if it's supposed to happen, it will. Regardless of the outcome, we are sure grateful for the journey!!!Thank you in advance!the ASBW crew

                        Furniture: The Musical is a quirky new musical about the lives, loves, and interactions of the sentient pieces of furniture that live within a college freshmans dorm room. While the pieces of furniture can talk amongst themselves, the college freshman does not know that they exist as more than objects. Furniture: The Musical is a commentary on universal human emotions and behaviors and how they can be conveyed through non-human, even non-living, characters. Full of poignant metaphors and funny jokes, Furniture: The Musical will take you on a rollercoaster in which youll laugh, cry, and leave with a new appreciation for your furniture back home.Natalie Lifson first conceived the idea of ""Furniture: The Musical when she jokingly wrote a monologue at 3am about a chair who wanted their owner to stop sitting on them so often while she was on Skype with one of her friends, Jeffrey Schmelkin. While the monologue was initially written in jest, she thought it was so was funny that she decided to rewrite it and base an entire musical around it. Jeffrey, a composer himself, was interested in working on the project as well. Over the next five days, the pair worked tirelessly from conception to completion to write and compose Furniture: The Musical. Less than two weeks later, the show was being workshopped at French Woods Festival. Since then, multiple songs and scenes have been added to the show.Furniture: The Musicals New York City premiere will take place late July in the Midtown International Theatre Festival. We hope to raise $1,500- $2,000 to create the best final product possible. Furniture: The Musical is our baby and we would love the opportunity to share our best work with you on July 27th, 29th, and 31st when it premieres at the Workshop Theatres Main Stage under the direction of Sean O'Shea.We would be incredibly grateful for any donations that would help make our first major NYC production a success. Any amount, no matter how small, would be helpful.Thank you!

                                                            on behalf of Saint Patrick School Art Program

PORTSMOUTH, NH                                




My name is Shannon Bowser and I am the art teacher at a small caltholic school in NH called Saint Patrick School. This will be my second year teaching children from age 3 to grade 8. I try to maximize my budget by implementing projects that can maximize the use of the same materials with different age appropropriate challenges.I also use a ton of recycled materials. The school relies heavily on the community of St. Pat's parents to help raise funds to bridge the gap in cost of education and tuition, andto strenghten the SPS spirit.In the last several years since our last religious principal,Sr. Mary Jo, retired the school has been struggling financially . The changes in staff and leadership have motivated the teachers and parents to look for ways to stay united and be supportive. I believe that the Puzzle Art Installation & Collaborative Project developed by Tim Kelly would be an amazing event not only for fundraising,but also to raise spirits and reinforce the Catholic belief that we are a part of something much bigger than ourselves.The Puzzle Project creates the opportunity for participants to own a 24''x24'' puzzle piece and then use that ""canvas"" to express something meaningful to the individual, collaborate with each other and participate in a global effort.Not only will each piece connect to every piece created by our community and result in a collaborative installation but also the students and community can be involved in a positiveinternational exhibit that has been growingover 7 years now.""It is always the small pieces that make the big picture."" - unknown

The art department at St. Pat's (myself and some parents) will host a launch party where puzzle pieces can be purchased in support of SPS art program. The funds would be used toorder 200 precut puzzle pieces from the project's partnerCreative Seven, LLC - 67 West Street, 4th Floor/37 Brooklyn, NY 11222 at$5 per piece and for art supplies used at the launch party. Iwould like to give one to each student and then sell the remainingpieces to family members and community supporters for $15 or $20 to raise money for the school.I would love to kickthis project off just before Thanksgiving to tap into the reflection and celebration that is a natural part of this season. This would be November 2, or November 9 2016.Then can you imagine a New Year celebration in January where we assemble 200 puzzle pieces at the public library or in the school lobby and have the unveiling?! Great community builder and opportunity to raise supportfor the Arts.I had hoped to do this project last year and have already been corresponding with Tim Kelly. The students LOVED the idea. But ifwe don't get these funds we simply can't participate inthis experience.Our country and our world need more opportunities to create something wonderful by coming together. Iwould personally be very grateful to all of you who make a contribution to help realize this vision. We would keep you in our prayers and acknowledge your support to our entire community. And the students will be so excited to share their work of art as their THANK YOU!

Thank you for taking the time to read this and check out the links.Sincerely,Shannon

Cost - $1,700While I know it's not necessary, I want to give you things for your donations - if you want them!

                             First of all, it pains me to ask for monetary assistance for anything, but being a responsible husband and father, I can't realistically do this on my own currently. Rest assured I am employed. I have a day job. This is just a passion of mine that I would like to make more than just a hobby. I have the skills and I would like to offer them to the public. This is in no way a scam to get money to blow on myself. This ONLY cover the tools I need to get the job done correctly.      I would like to start up a guitar repair shop as the main operation for now to get a customer base.  Setups, restring jobs, new nuts, saddles, machine heads, pickups etc. as examples. The main goal for the future would be to build completely custom instruments for customers. Literally starting from bare wood to finished product. The exact paint/finish and every part as the customer wants it, for a price significantly less than what you would expect from the ""big guys"".  Your budget is the limit.

I am often asked when Inferno will complete The Highwayman movie. We were only 10 days short of completion when disaster struck. We might be able to cut some scenes and finish shooting in fewer days. However, the calamity that hit us not only left us short a director, but deep in debt. It is the combined debt from the merger of Inferno, Midgard, Asgard, etc. It was the debt that partially funded The Highwayman and Gathering of Heroes.

I've sold lots of equipment and some costumes and props (not related to Highwayman) and whittled it down. Most of the equipment is gone. I am not yet willing to sell Highwayman's costumes, props and set dressings.

As of February 13, 2016 Inferno's debt totals $30,428. Nearly $5000 was paid in interest on that debt in 2015. Payments on the interest and principle absorb all of Inferno's income and then some. I cannot even think of completing The Highwayman until the debt is paid off.

I would like to clear all the debt today, but even paying off 1/3 of it will reduced the interest and help pay the rest faster. All funds received will be used to pay Inferno's debts. If, by some wild chance, the funds received exceed the debt, the rest will be used to complete The Highwayman.

Friends, colleagues, filmmakers, actors, writers, or strangers.... I will be profoundly grateful for anything you can spare and I know all those involved in The Highwayman would also be grateful to get us on the road to completing the movie.

                        The Nightmare K!dz are an up and coming horror film family. Since our move from New York, we've commited to our love for horror cinema. We've begun our passion project in our found footage feature, The Screening. We've funded this film 100% on our own, and now we just need to wrap it up with editing, and sound mixing.
