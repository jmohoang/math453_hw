BREAKING NEWS!!! We are ADOPTING... TWINS!!Double the fun & twice the trouble! It's a long and beautiful story that only God could have written into our lives. But we have legallybegun the process of adopting beautiful baby boy and girl currenlty 9 weeks old.They have been with us for a month while we waited to see if their birth mom would allow them to be adopted. And in the end our prayer for a family was answered in the most amazing way, when their BirthMom legally surrendered the babies to us this week.This is a ""doorstep"" or ""suprise"" adoption. It was not something we planned on doing nor were we on a waiting list for these little ones. We literally got a phone call from a friend that changed our world one Sunday after church asking if we were ""interested in adopting newborn twins??"" To which we said... ""Ummmm, YES!!"" So, here we are... Following the doors God opens and knowing HE has a way to provide for it. We did not use an adoption agency, we were not on a waiting list, and we did NOT save 10k to spend this fall. But that is exactly what we need in the next 60-90 days. This is just to cover our home study $1500, court cost aprox 3500k, and private adoption lawyer 6000k. To say the least we do NOT have that saved anywhere. Thus the go fund me...We have some of the best friends and most generous brothers and sister on the planet. We hate to ask for your help, but we were literally threatened by several of you to start this... So here it is. We thank you in advance for your love and support. We ask for your prayers as we currently have the 9 wk old twins, a 4 month old baby boy (#tripplets) and a 2.5yr old foster buddy. We went from no children to 4 children in less than four months. Our hands and heart are full! We are blessed and exhausted, happy and amazed at what God has done.From the bottom of our hearts... THANK YOU!

Help Nicole Keep Her Son,"$1,195 ","$3,500 ",Family," September 23, 2016",27,2,CRESTWOOD,KY,91000,,1,"

CRESTWOOD, KY                                





                        Nicole's ex-husband, Dave (an alcoholic, drug user, and convicted abuser with a criminal record who was also placed into a mental institution by the authorities), is trying to take their three-year-old son, Giovanni, from her and has already won three days custody of him each week. He has accomplished this by having his mother defend him and help him to pay for a really good lawyer (even though his own mother has called the police about him countless times in the past for his intoxication and violent behavior around Nicole and little Giovanni). Nicole cannot afford the legal fees for a lawyer and has no one to help her - her family does not believe Dave with his criminal record will be able to take their grandson, but he has already won three days a week and on September 30th, he is fighting to have him six months of the year or more. All this back and forth between households, especially Dave's who is mentally unstable and abusive, is not healthy for little Giovanni who is only three years old. Please, please help Nicole raise the legal funds she needs to see that Dave does not win this custody hearing which he has only begun to pursue now that Nicole has moved on and is trying to create a brighter, better future for herself and her son. She has already received two job offers out of state, but Dave has ensured that he continues to control her by not allowing her to leave their current state where she has been unable to find work in the past ten months that she has been trying. Help Nicole and Giovanni stay together and move on with their lives by donating anything you can to help her afford her lawyer's retainer fees. You will be helping a little innocent boy who is caught in the middle of his abusive alcoholic father's legal battle to regain control.

TITUSVILLE, NJ                                





                        The Herrington-Volaric Family is an incredible family with an incredible story. Its a story filled with uncompromising commitment to love, family and children in need. All three of the Herrington-Volaric kids were adopted from the foster system, and they are now preparing to welcome two additional children  the siblings of two of their adopted children  into their family. However, their current home doesnt have the room for two more children, and they now plan to buy and renovate a fixer-upper housein hopes of giving these two children the loving and supportive home they need. Any and all support that you can give towards helping them achieve this goal would be greatly appreciated. Continue reading to hear their amazing story, written by Sandee, the courageous mom whose dedication to these children has never wavered:***********************************************************In 1999, when my husband Steve and I met and fell in love, we didn't think we wanted children. By the time we got married in 2003, we were a bit less certain and started thinking about fostering and adoption. In 2005 we moved to New Jersey for work and started seriously thinking about starting a family and fostering to adopt. Because we wanted to give any future children a sense of stability and security, we first chose to buy a home. We bought a modest starter home, and due to a variety of factors, its still the home we live in now. In 2006 we became a licensed resource (foster) home and started short-term fostering, but we quickly realized we were too sensitive to do short-term placements because it was too painful to say goodbye. We decided that-long term fostering was our real calling so that we could make foster children a permanent part of our family.Our oldest son Gabe was placed with us in 2007 at 10 months old, and he was perfect. We fell in love with him immediately, as did our family and friends, but we waited what seemed like an eternity to be able to adopt him. While we were navigating the system and waiting to adopt Gabe (which we finally did in 2010), we still entertained the idea of perhaps having biological children as well. That thought disappeared the moment our daughter Sondra was placed with us. Sondra was 5 weeks old when she was placed with us in 2010, and she instantly stole our hearts. Incredibly, Sondra was the birth sibling of our first two foster children, and we thought it a clear indicator she was meant to be a part of our forever family. Sondras adoption was completed in 2011, and we were over the moon with joy. We couldn't believe how incredibly lucky we were to have two such wonderful children in our little family and in our lives. We thought our family was complete.At the end of 2012, we got a call about a 2-day old baby boy who was amazingly the biological sibling of Sondra and in need of a family. We worried about whether we could handle 3 kids and give them everything they need and deserve. However, we knew it was the right thing to do, and within two wild hours, our family of 4 suddenly became a family of 5 as we welcomed our son, Lovie, into our home and family. We officially adopted Lovie in 2013. With three adoptions finalized, our modest 3-bedroom house is definitely full and our family feels complete.When people ask us what if questions about whether we would take more kids, we joke that we would take in many more if we had the financial means. We took ourselves off the foster list due to the space in our house, but we knew we might get calls about other siblings. That seemed a far-off possibility, but we knew we'd make that choice if it was warranted. In mid-July, we got a call about Sondra and Lovies two half-siblings. They have been split apart from each other; one in a short-term foster home and one in a facility. L, a girl is 9 and S, a boy is 8. We already knew of them because we got calls about them when they were babies. They weren't placed with us, though, because their biological father was found, and they were placed with him. We thought they were living happily ever after with their birth father, but sadly that has not been the case. Proceedings have started to terminate their relationship to their father, and they may need placement very soon.Their lives have not been easy. They need a home, and they need a permanent family.We would like to be that family. We have the space in our hearts, but we don't have the space in our home. Our home does not meet the minimum state licensing requirements for two more children. We need a bigger house if we have any hopes of bringing home L & S, and renovating our current house proved to be extremely cost-prohibitive. Because we are committed to these children, we are currently buying a fixer-upper in our current town and have plans to renovate it so the whole family will be comfortable and happy. We are uncomfortable asking for help, but we know what the future likely holds for L & S if we can't take them. The state has run out of kinship resources and their current foster homes are not interested in adopting them. They have expressed that their one desire is to be together. People aren't exactly lining up to adopt older children, let alone a sibling group. We fear they will bounce from placement to placement and eventually age out of the foster care system, left to navigate this world on their own. We want them to be able to live in our happy forever family  together  with their two half-siblings, a brother their age, a loving mom and dad, and a welcoming family and friend network eager to embrace them and work through any challenges.A move plus a renovation (not to mention renting our current house) will be a challenge, but nothing is more important than providing these two children with stability, love, and certainty. Please help us give these kids what so many of us have never had to consider living without. Whatever help you can offer would be much appreciated by all of us. Their lives matter, and with your help, their future is bright and full of hope.""***********************************************************Sondra, Lovie and Gabe - July 2016From left to right: Gabe, Steve, Lovie, Sandee and Sondra, July 2016Steve and Sandee, July 2016

Brad & Tara Surprise adoption!,"$8,285 ","$32,000 ",Family," September 17, 2016",123,8,CLOVIS,CA,961000,,6,"

                        I would like to introduce you to our sweet & dear friends, Brad and Tara...We met them while we were both in Ethiopia completing adoptions & became fast friends!They are an amazing couple, who loves the Lord and lives hands open to however He leads them...What started for them, as adopting one baby from Ethiopia, turned into God calling them back to adopt a sibling set as well, a 10y/o boy & his 2 y/o brother..0-3 kids (and, ahem, 3 sets of adoption expenses) in less then a year! Their hearts were once again drawn to not just caring for the fatherless but helping women in crisis pregnancies. And despite living off of just two teacher salaries...they pursued infant domestic adoption. They got their sweet boy Micah 18 months ago.They were not planing to adopt again, But God....They just received a call that their son's birthmama was pregnant again & wanted them to adopt this baby too! But she's due in less then 2 months..I prayed with my dear friend as they wrestled with this, they wanted to so badly say yes & couldn't fathom saying no! But financially, there was no way they could pay that much so fast...so that's where we come in!They've committed to adopt this baby & are hastily working to complete all the paperwork required. They need to raise $32,000 in the next 30 days...I know, it's a lot! But if everyone of my friends and hers, just donated $10, that would be close to $12,000! They are preparing to take out a loan for what they need to..Not everyone can adopt, but everyone can help a family do so..please consider donating, share this...a little bit by many, truly adds up!**many times in an adoption process, when talking about how much it costs & especially in fundraising, adoptive families are asked, ""why does it cost so much?"" and sometimes told, ""well if you cant afford it then you shouldn't adopt""..to the 2nd I tell people, if they had had a biological child who was born prematurely and in the NICU for months, they would have to fundraise to cover all those medial bills, they wouldnt say ""sorry, we can't afford this"". And to the first question, please know that none of this money goes to the birthmom & the agency they are using is a non-profit. Adoption monies go to pay all of the office staff salaries, the social worker's -who spend countelss hours with these birthmama's-salary, paperwork to make sure families are safe..the list goes on and on...**

Help Dan and Casey with IVF,"$10,265 ","$30,000 ",Family," April 11, 2016",160,5,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,1200,6,9,"

MINNEAPOLIS, MN                                





                        Thank you for visiting our gofundme site. This site has beencreated to help us with the expenses that are going to be coming from the IVF treatment we are starting at the end of this month. We were hoping to do all of this on our own, but we realized very quickly that we just can't.Dan and I have been trying to have a child for almost 4 years now. 4 miscarriages later, we are now going to try IVF. We have done lots of testing on ourselves, and our babies. Dan and I are both fine, and have no issues. Our babies (the last two miscarriages, as insurance doesn't cover testing the babies till you have had 3 losses) had extra chromosomes. The third baby had 3 extra, and the 4th had 4 extra. There is no real reason for why they had extra chromosomes, which can be really hard. If there was an issue, they could just fix it, and we would be good! We decided to visit a specialist to discuss our options at the end of March. We met with Doctor Batcheller at CCRM. Shewas very direct in telling us that IVF would be our best option. They will be able to do testing on the eggs that they fertilize, and make sure that they have the proper number of chromosomes. In my mind, completely eliminating the issue we have been having.Like I said, we will begin this journey at the end of April. ***please note I am not a doctor (what? right?!), so the next is just a dumb down version of what will happen.*** They will first do some tests, and a few procedures on me. These tests will help to decide what type/how much medication I will need, and also to make sure everything is structurally still good with me. Then in May I will start the medication. From what I hear it will be injections that I take, and it will help me to produce as many eggs as possible in my next cycle. Saying everything goes well, I believe that in June they would retrieve the eggs. That's when the magic really happens! They will fertilize my eggs, let them develop for a while, and then send some of the cells to their main clinic in Denver. They will look at the cells and determine which ones are viable. The doctor said that we should imagine that there will be 1 or 2 that will be viable...hopefully more, but better to think that way. At that point we will decide (if we have more than 1 egg) how many we will put in my uterus, and then we will hopefully have a successful pregnancy, and then a very cute, big headed baby! If we have extra fertilized eggs, they will be frozen.Your insanely generous donation (no matter how much) will go toward the cost of all the magic I described above. It's hard for us to ask for this help, as there is a chance it won't work. But like everything else in life, we don't know how things are going to go, and we just have to be positive and move forward.We will continue to keep everyone updated on my blog, caseyhaeg.blogspot.com.Thank you again for reading our story, and for being on this journey with us.Love,Casey and Dan (and WhatWhat the pug)

Help us adopt Noah ,"$1,760 ","$10,000 ",Family," September 20, 2016",38,4,BUDA,TX,279000,1,,"






                            Rebecca Williams
                            
                            
                                                           
BUDA, TX                                





                        Hi! We are Jon and Rebecca (and Judson) Williams, and we're in the process of adopting our greatnephew Noah. As I'm sure you can imagine the adoption process is not cheap, and we could use a little help. We've been the only home Noah has known since he left the NICU a few months after he was born, and we intend to make our home his home forever. Thank you so much for taking the time to read our story, and we appreciate any little bit of help you can give.And now for a little background on how we got here:A week or two before Thanksgiving last year, my wife Rebecca and I decided that we wouldn't be having any more children. Within days of our decision, things changed, as they often do.11 months ago, on the 20th of October, our greatnephew Noah was born. He was six weeks premature and had a few issues at birth so he spent the first several weeks of his life in the NICU. As he started to approach being able to go home it was decided by his social worker that the home that was planned for him to go to would not be acceptable, and that somewhere else needed to be found. That's when we got the call, we agreed to take him, and his mother in without hesitation. Far be it from us to turn away a child in need, especially family.Originally, we were supposed to give Noah and his birth mother a home for a short time until we could teach her how to mother and care for him, and then they could start their life together. That all fell apart before Noah ever came home from the hospital, so we were asked if we would like to foster Noah while his parents worked with CPS to regain custody of Noah. Between my grandparents, and Rebecca's parents, our families have adopted 6 children, so the opportunity to foster Noah meant an awful lot to us. We brought Noah home from the hospital on December 12th, and his big cheeks and tiny smile were the best Christmas present we couldn't possibly even have imagined a month before. We instanly fell in love with him, and two weeks later the CPS hearings started. For the next eight months, we had nearly monthly hearings, along with twice monthly home visits with several different social workers assigned to Noah's case. All through this time, Noah grew in our hearts and into our family. He became a part of our family, as real and important to us as our own son, Judson. Then in late, July, Noah's parents rights were removed and we were asked if we were 'in it for the long haul', we'd known that question was coming, and we'd made the decision months before. There was no way that we would go forward without adopting Noah, and making him the final piece to our family puzzle.So that's where we are right now, Noah is our son, and Judson's brother, as far we are concerned, and we'll do everything in our power to make that a reality in the eyes of the State of Texas, and that's why we need your help. We met with our adoption specialist for the first time today, and the date we're aiming for to finalize Noah's adoption, and get him a brand new last name is November 12th. That's coming on fast, and we need some help getting the money together to complete Noah's adoption. The money we are requesting will be used to pay the adoption fee itself, the associated attorney fees, and if we're able to get fully funded, a month or two of childcare while we get situated post-adoption. I can't begin to express how much it means to me that you've taken the time just to read this far, and I will never be able to properly express my thanks for any little bit of help you are able to give us in our attempt to adopt little Noah, and make our family whole forever. Like I mentioned earlier, adoption has played a very important role in the building of the families that both Rebecca and I call our own, and it's so important to us that we're able to extend that same opportunity to little Noah, especially since he'll be able to stay with the family that he was born into. There is no other option for us, we have to adopt Noah. I can't imagine living in a world where we have to give Noah up to someone else. He's sitting here beside me as I type, eating cheerios by the fistful, and dada-ing me every time I turn back to the computer. I can't let him go to someone else, and learn to call someone else daddy. This boy is our son, and all we need now is the paperwork to make it official. Thank you thank you thank you so much for any help you can give. We will be forever indebted to you.- Jon WilliamsSeptember 20, 2016

Help Matthew & Sabrina adopt a son!,"$3,805 ","$25,000 ",Family," September 23, 2016",21,1,OCEANSIDE,CA,273000,,3,"

OCEANSIDE, CA                                





                        It was only 1 1/2 months ago, Sunday, August 7th to be exact that God spoke clearly to us that He wanted us to adopt. Only 1 1/2 months ago!!!We said, ""Yes, Lord!"" and began doing our due diligence by checking out agencies. We have gone to two orientation meetings with two different agencies (this is the first step at any agency) but we fell in love with a third one that we merely had a phone call with. We were slightly disappointed that the earliest we coud get to their orientation meeting was November 14th. But we were trusting God and His timing.Then, on Tuesday, September 20th at noon, our entire world changed. We were called by the agency and asked if we were only interested in newborns. But before I go there, let me tell you a little more about our process.We knew we were going to adopt. That was it! God was only revealing onestep at a time, which is fine because He is God and we trust Him. But with that comes a lot of unknowns. We were pretty confident about a few things; we would adopt local and we hoped to have a boy anywhere from newborn to age 4. This was at least our wish list, but even at that, we were open to whomever God had picked out for us.Every agency we have talked with has given us the projected timeline. About 4-6 months to complete the process to be eligible to adopt, and then approximately another 6 months to 2 years for placement. We were settling in for the long haul. Again, this didn't bother us, we were just trusting God that as we took steps, He would illuminate our path and make every step plain.So we were NOT expecting this call on Tuesday. The agency director, who is also a Christian and understands our faith and how God must play a part in all of this, called us and asked us the question, ""Are you only interested in newborns."" To which we replied, ""Nope! We are totally open to an older child."" That is when she began to tell us a story about a young boy, age 4, in need of a forever family. I can't go into his story, but both Matthew and I stood there listening and tears filled our eyes.We took the next 24 hours and prayed. And when we came back together, we felt peace about moving forward with the next step of meeting with the Director and having an interview with her. So we did, on Thursday. And that is where we found out the cost of this independant adoption. This is time sensitive and we are CONFIDENT that if God is in this, He will provide. We still have some steps in front of us, but in order to take those steps, we need to have some things paid for.We are going to do all we can on our end to raise the money needed, and we will depend on God to go above and beyond what we cannot possibly do on our own. We aren't begging for money, but some of you have asked if we could set up this account as you don't live anywhere by us and want to be a part of our story. And for that we are so very grateful. All the money raised will go towards our adoption expenses and getting what this little guy will need. He could be in our home within 2-3 weeks!We can't adopt all of the children, but we can adopt one, and raise him to be a boy of God, world changer, and mighty warrior. We love you all and thank you ahead of time for reading our story that is only just beginning.We welcome your prayers and look forward to introducing our forever son with you very shortly!!!

Nicaragua Mission trip,"$1,065 ","$2,500 ",Family," September 23, 2016",23,2,GLEN ROCK,NJ,59000,,,"

                        My name is Max and I am trying to raise money for a mission trip with my school to Nicaragua. The money you donate will go to hygenic products such as soap and toothbrushes that we take for granted, toys and clothes for the Children,and most importantly building materials for the complex that Don Bosco Prep and the family of Fr. Manny Gallo have been expandingon for years. We will be going on February break, 2017 with a select group of under 20 guys. The cinder block and mortar building with metal sheet roofing seems like luxury to these people who live in houses made of whatever they can find in the trash. The more material we can afford, the better the complex will be. Most of the houses for a full family are not even the size of one master bathroom. We need all the help we can get in an effort to build the best structures possible to help and serve as many of the Nicaraguan street families and children as possible. We also make a trip to a center for children with disabilities and spend a full day with them. I have been told by my older peers who have done this trip that when you get there you immediately want to give all you have to these people, no matter how much you bring, you wish you broughtmore. We also spend a day on top of a landfill and interact with the people who are picking through mounds of rancid trash to find plastic bottles or cans to sell for their value of a few cents. We offer them a hot lunch usually of rice and beans and they are extremely thankful. I found out about this trip in freshman year and immediately knew it was something I had to be a part of in my senior year. We get the opportunity to live among the poor yet extremely caring people of Nicaragua and see what it is like to live asthey do. The ultimate goal is to build an area that can be a safe haven for children and adults who need medical and dental care or just a safe clean place to run around and be kids so that they can keep living well, long after we have gone. Even a small donation will help me reach my goal. Thanks for your support! Here is theVideo describing the work done last year.

September 14th the day Tanner was born. The day we should all be celebrating his 31st birthday and wishing him a Happy Birthday. Yet, this year is much different. Instead we are praying and sending the family positive thoughts to Alyssa, Carter,and the entire Pedigo family & friends. Tanner was involved in a shooting homicide {which is currently under investigation. News story can be found here: http://m.news9.com/Story.aspx?story=33090348&catId=118245} My name is Lindsey and I am a longtime friend of the family (Alyssa and I have been friends for over 15 years), and right now the family is torn and at a loss of words. However, this does not stop the bills from piling up, along with funeral expenses to pay for, rent, car payment, and everyday expenses from accumulating. As many know, Alyssa is finishing her last semester of Graduate school and Tanner was the main source of income. With an almost two-year-old Carter, who is Daddys boy, and one precious baby girl on the way (due in January), Alyssa is going to need all the emotional and financial support we can provide. Every little bit counts -big or small! Please help this family get through thishorrific tragedy. If anything at all, please spread the word.

                        Hello. My name is Lisa. My cousin Jason and his beautiful wife Danielle welcomed an amazing individual into the world ten years ago this month. Their son Colin was born April 12, 2005. When Colin was just a few months old he was diagnosed with Menkes Disease. Menkes disease is a fatal illness in which the intestines are unable to absorb copper, depriving the brain and other tissues of this essential mineral. This disease is also known as Menkes Kinky Hair disease and Menkes syndrome.As a mother this just breaks my heart. And as a family member I feel the need to do something. Colin's family has a benefit every year to raise money for Menkes and its foundation. This page is for Colin and his family. Colin is a big boy. Tall like his dad. And an inspiration to us all. So strong and brave. Even after extensive surgeries and sickness. He gets that from his parents.Colin has defied the odds. Hitting 10 is an incredible milestone. He needs a handicap accessible minivan. His mother must hide her muscles under her super mom cape. It's very hard for her to get him in and out of their current vehicle. And she's had many problems with it. Colin's parents are working so hard to make this new minivan possible. But it's tough. They also have a three year old daughter. Colin's mom and dad are humble. That's where social media and I come in! Please contribute to this amazing little man and his family.  Colin has fought for life. Let's show him how much we support his will to live and his parents. And help Colin get around town with a minivan that caters to his needs. Thanks everyone. Please share this page!!!

My name is Amber and I would like to help my best friend and her husband raise money to have a better shot at having a successful, full term pregnancy and fulfil Sarah's life long dream of motherhood. They are so deserving of the gift of parenthood and any help we can give them to reach this lifelong goal, is so appreciated.

Here is Sarah and Josh's story of their struggle to have a child:

When Sarah and Josh met 12 years ago, they had no idea at the time, that they would fall in love and get married10 years later!  Sarah and Josh purchased a home together and dreamed of starting a family. Shortly after getting engaged in July 2015, the happy couple found out that they were expecting. Having had a miscarriage before, Sarah understandably had a deep fear of losing this pregnancy as well. Fifteen days before their wedding, they suffered another miscarriage. They were both understandably devastated and heartbroken beyond belief. OnOctober 17th, 2015, Josh and Sarah were married. As they both began to heal from their loss, and with the strength of their love, they decided to try to get pregnant again. They were given hope by their doctors that both miscarriages were just bad luck and that the next time, things would be different and they would have a healthy, full term pregnancy. After eight months of trying, they finally became pregnant. Full of hope and optimism, they began to plan their future with their little one Sadly; just as with the other pregnancies, in the 10thweek they found out that the baby had stopped growing at 6 weeks and no longer had a heartbeat. Their infertility doctor has run numerous tests on both of them, and ruled out any foreseeable reason for the losses, aside from the belief that something is hindering the development of the embryos. Their doctor has recommended investing in IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) in order to give their little blessing the best chance at survival. IVF is the process of fertilization by manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish, and then transferring the embryo to the uterus. The doctor believes that by ensuring that only the most viable embryos are implanted, they will have the best chance at a successful pregnancy. While Sarahs insurance has helped with some of the costs of testing, but her insurance does not pay anything toward infertility treatments such as IVF. Similarly, Joshs insurance does not offer any coverage for infertility either. After consulting with their doctor regarding the costs, they have been told that IVF ranges from $18,000-$22,000. Being a mother means more to Sarah than anything else in the world and for as long as she can remember, she has dreamt of being a wife and mother. She finally found her prince charming and perfect match in Josh and being able to have a baby has been such a difficult journey for them and has left a hole in their lives. Because Sarah is an elementary school teacher and Josh is currently attending college while working full time, their financial situation does not leave a lot of room for them to afford the treatments they need to grow their family.  Since Sarah and Josh are not the type of people that ask for help or hand-outs, I am asking for your help on their behalf. There are no two people more deserving of this dream than Sarah and Josh and people are always asking them what they can do to help them through this, so I figured this is the best thing that any of us can do to helpthem achieve their dream of parenthood. Any donation will help them get closer to fulfilling their dream of having a family.Sarah and Josh are both such wonderful people and will be the most amazing, loving and attentive parents any child could hope for.  Thank you so much for your love and support in this trying time.

                                                As many of you know my sister Mandi Joyce passed away this week, losing her battle to addiction. We are currently planning a funeral that is taking its toll on all of us, especially my mom. She is the sole provider for Madison. I'm sure most of youwho have childrenare aware of what that consist of. We are hoping to raise enough money to provide Madison with anything she may need in the near future, more importantly to set up an account to start saving for college. People have asked how they can help, and I know times are hard right now for everyone. But, if you are able and wanting to know how you can help at this time, this would be the way to contribute. Right now our focus is on Mandi's daughter and making sure she has every oppurtunity to go to school . Thank you if you decide to donate, and thank you even if you can't. We have been flooded with prayers and condolences and that alone shows us how much God has given us to be grateful for. Thanks to anyone who has sent messages, flowers, or even FB posts.... that means more to us than you will ever know. My baby sister will be missed by many, especially me and her family.

Half for the Hogar,"$4,525 ","$3,500 ",Family," August 18, 2016",72,1,READING,MA,406000,,,"






                            Jillian Bowers Black
                            
                            
                                                           
READING, MA                                




In 2001, a dear friend of mine moved from Boston to Bolivia to spend a year volunteering in an orphange for young girls. 15 years later, she is still there, working to provide love, support and care for the over 120 girls who call the Hogar Sagrado Corazon - or Sacred Heart Orphanage -- home.This orphanage and the girls who call it home have become extremely important to me. For me, the connection began when Deysi, a young girl who had been severely burned as a child, came to Boston to receive medical care to help repair the severe scarring on her face and hands. Her care and travel was all donated, and Anna (my friend) and Deysi stayed with Ben and me several times while she was cared for at Shriner's. After meeting Deysi, the hogar -- and all the girls in it -- became beautifully and painfully real.Let me tell you about the Hogar. The hogar is ""state"" run but only on paper-- the nuns run it all. Their max is 112 children. However, they actually house more than 120 kids ranging in age from newborn to young 20's. The state has issued a requirement that all children in orphanages must leave on their 18th birthday. However, they have many chidren who come to them with severe issues (abuse, abandonment, etc) and don't even start school until they are much older than what we expect in the states (they have had kindergartners who are 9 and 10). Thus, at age 18, it is not uncommon for the girls to be freshman in high school. The hogar will not turn them out without finishing at least high school (and likes to send them to university if they can). Thus their ballooning population.The hogar has so many needs. The nuns that care for these girls are their family, and love the kids with all their hearts. They may lack blood family to care for them, but they have a sisterhood of friends and women who love them deeply and do all they can to care for them with extremely limited resources.At this moment, the hogar is in a dire financial. The government of Bolivia provides inadequate funding to feed, clothe, educate and care for these girls. The government provides 10 bolivianos per child for EVERYTHING. That is roughly $1.50 per child per day for all meals, clothes, health costs, school supplies, etc. This is not enough -- not even close.On September 25th, I am running a half marathon - which, for me, is a big deal - to support these girls. I cannot imagine my kids not having everything they need, not having parents to hug them every night, to read them any story they want, to take them for ice cream after special events -- the list goes on. These girls have none of these things -- and they are no different than any of our kids. They are sweet, thoughtful, loving, sensitive, funny, smart, needy children -- who are starting life with the barest of necessities.We can help.Please consider making a small (or large!) donation to help support the wonderful girls at the Hogar Sagrado Corazon. I know for a fact that every penny they receive is used to help these girls (because my friend is one of the ones who oversees the money) -- and believe me, your donation will not go as far almost anywhere else as it will here.Because this is a very small organization, they are not set up to take donations through a crowdrise or other tax-deductible online service provider. If you donate here, I will send a personal check to them in a lump sum. If you prefer to take a tax deduction,you can send them a check directly (let me know, and I will give you the info).Thank you for your generous support.MORE INFO - Current Needs:1. SCHOOL TUTION:  -The hogar tries to get as many of their kids into private schools as possible as they are FAR superior and these girls need all the support they can get. Previously, some schools allowed many girls to go at a reduced cost. Now, they are charging close to the full amount which is impossible for the hogar to pay.2. SCHOOL SUPPLIES  -All children in school must provide their own uniform and school supplies (text and workbooks) -- public or private. The hogar spends close to $100 per child to go to school (not including tuition). They had to take out a huge debt on credit to get the girls to school back in February (the start of their school year).  They get some help from the government and some private support, but are very short.3. BASIC SECURITY -The wall around the Hogar is falling down. This is a major issue as there is no security, no locks on doors, or even windows. The hogar is in a neighborhood that is increasingly dangerous and has growing active gangs and armed robberies. The perimeter wall is there to keep these babies and children safe -- a basic human right. They have been able to redo about a third of the wall but have run out of funds for the bricks, cement and labor.4. ESSENTIAL DAILY COSTS -At funding of $1.50 a day per kid, they just can't stretch the money far enough. They do not receive any money for basics like gasoline for the one minibus and truck that must suffice for all the nuns and 120 kids, back up funds for things like unplanned illnesses and even surgeries, or even simple things we take for granted like little treats or a birthday gift for these kids.

                        My name is Geddy,I am a father to 3 beautiful children,that Isigned myself up for child support for all 3 and continue to be blaintley denied my time, assulted, harassed, drug through court, been accused of unspeakable acts that i was brought to The Dr. Phil Show (titled:""protective Mom or Jilted lover"")and proved myself innocent and my kids mother completely mentally unstable. False injunctions when my oldest son was in town so he and his (then 1 year old) brother couldn't meet. False charges ect..I am raising money for lawyer fees to get my son from his mentally ill mother that has gone against our parenting plan to deny me our son for several months,until she seeks the proper help and is mentally stable enough to co-parent properly. Then go after her for the countless slander events and several false police reports. She is in contempt of court right nowbutcant see a judge for several months unless i pay to have an emergency hearing. Her family has money to get the best lawyers and cant compare to their financial resourses.I'm also trying to get a trip to get another Ohio lawyer to modify my visitation with, and see my 6 years old son.is Mothersaid she was going to see her sick grandmother while she was 4 months pregnant with our son. Come to find out she had a 1 way plane ticket and no intentions of returning. She said to not contact her and never worry about him. So i found out the due date, flew to Ohio and signed myself up for child support. I have spent thousands to get minimal visits and she denies me all communication. I dont believe she even gives him the things i sent. I sent a prepaid phone with an extra phone card so he and I could talk and was sent back. Haven't spoken to him in months!!!My other childs mother is attempting to take 4 of my 8 days time share with my 3 years old daughter and most likely will without legal representation.I'm not one to ask for hand-outs but without lawyers fees my kids mothers will continue to attempt to break me by continuing to deny me time share, communication and the beautiful gift of watching my children grow up into the people they will become. Without my guidance as a good father to instill the proper value and understanding in my children then they will only make our lives darker by contributing more people with the mothers distorted mentalities to our futures. I want to give my children a better chance than they are going to have with their mothers.I never knew my real father as he is the perfect deffinition of a dead beat dad and only met him a couple times in my life and want the oposite for my children. My children mean everything to me and I have fought for each one since before they were born and i refuse to allow them to continue to keep me from my children. Evey time tax time comes they are givenTHOUSANDS to attack me in court and bully me out of my parental rights.It would mean the world to me to getthis very loving family together. Anyone that knows me knows that I'm a very devoted father, a good person that is respectful, responsible and very passonate that my children turn out to have the same attitude. They are my world and I miss them more than words can describe. I want them to grow up knowing there siblings. Everyone deserves that.God BlessSincerely,Geddy

Help Reese see a brighter future,"$2,970 ","$15,000 ",Family," June 17, 2016",30,3,LAFAYETTE,LA,396000,,2,"

                        My name is Laci Guidry. I have three children. My two boys, Reese and Ryker, have congenital nystamus. Nystagmus is a condition of involuntary eye movements. The eye muscles that control eye movement receive a pulsating stimulus to contract, instead of a quiet steady tone. People with this affliction will adopt an unusual head, or eye position to minimize their unwanted appearance, or wear dark glasses. When it has its onset in childhood, there is often a significant impact on education and social development. Most people with nystagmus never drive. Reese's nystagmus is moderate to severe according to our local ophthamologist. Ryker's nystagmus is mild. Reese is a very active 5 year old and loves to interact with other kids. In order to see he has to put things right in front of his eyes. It will be difficult for him as he gets into the higher grades in school.Dr. Lingua is a pediatric opthamologist in California who has perfected nearly a surgical cure. He has reviewed Reese's medical records and says he is a candidate.I have set up this gofundme account for people that want to donate but can't make the 5k run that I am organizing for September.As a mom it is so important to do what we can to make our childrens future brighter. This surgery can be life changing for Reese and will reduce the challenges he may face when he gets to school.Thank you so much for helping my sweet Reesey Piecey!!Laci Guidry

                        ""I will walk by faith even when I can not see."" 2 Corinthians 5:7For the longest time our family was hoping that my older brother Luis and my sister in law Jeimy would be able to conceive for the 2nd time. When finally God's timimg was right my sister in law announced in a beautiful picture that my niece was going to be a big sister! Our family was thrilled and excited that we would gain a new baby in our family. When they found out that the baby was going to be a boy we were all super excited that they were going to have the pair but following that surprise we also found out that my sweet little nephew was also diagnosed with Trisomy 18. Trisomy 18 also known as Edward's Syndrome, is a rare condition that is not compatible with life, meaning most babies do not make it past birth.My sister in law is 31 weeks now and the doctors are planning to schedule her c-section within the next few weeks so that they may be able to spend at least a few hours with their son while he is still alive. It breaks my heart to think that they will have to start preparing to plan a funeral when their baby is not even here yet. I decided to open the go fund me account for them because they truly deserve any help that they can receive. The money will go to help with all the medical bills that they have pilling up as well as the funeral arrangements. We thank you in advance for any donations that you may give and that God may continue to bless each and everyone of you.

Mom & 3 Kids Facing Homeless Status,"$3,405 ","$3,500 ",Family," September 18, 2016",46,7,BOUND BROOK,NJ,246000,,,"

                                                            on behalf of Lina Scarpulla

BOUND BROOK, NJ                                




Hello Family & Friends. We, thebasketballcoaches of the children on this page, are creating this GoFundMe page for a caring mother and loving children experiencing a hardship. They are facing homeless status soon (October 4, 2016) and they are out of options. During this time, they are seeking compassion, kindness and generosity from family, friends and the community to get them back on their feet and keep the family in the place they love-- their home town, Bound Brook, NJ. Anyone who lives in Bound Brook or any of the surrounding towns, it is more than likely that you have come across or in contact with this family and it can be for certain that theyve had a lasting impression on you. The mother works at the high school as a lunch aide, where all the students know and love her. All three kids are actively involved in the community by participating in school and recreational events, volunteering within the community, and/or engaged in church activities. The kids go above and beyond in school and in sports. Together they have reached achievements ranging from being inducted into the National Honor Society and excelling in football and basketball. The daughter is projected to have a promising future as she was recruited for an Elite AAU basketball program where she competes nationally at college showcases as an 8th grader and has received interest from coaches already. Its without a doubt that this family remains visible to the community members in such an admirable, positive and inspiring way. When you meet them, its hard to believe that behind their glowing smiles and warm hearts they have been struggling and facing an uphill battle.The mother and kids were living in a home with their grandmother. The grandmother helped raise her grandchildren and together, the grandmother and mother paid the mortgage and bills. The Grandmother suddenly passed away which left a single mother to pay a mortgage that was beyond her budget in addition to raising three children. She was able to manage it for some time; however they were struggling to survive on her income from working at the school. She tried to remain optimistic and continued to fight to keep her mothers home but it eventually caught up to her and she slowly started to fall behind on the mortgage. Before she knew it, the house was being foreclosed, and even then, she refused to give up. The struggle of being a single mother and pay a mortgage that was beyond her means became reality. She has since been served a letter stating they have until October 4th to leave their home. For the last few weeks she has contacted social services and has been looking for housing/shelter for her and her three kids but she hasnt had any luck especially with her time window frame. She is able to pay reasonable rent but cannot afford the initial cost to move in. Our goal is to raise enough money to get the family on their feet.We will put ALL money raised toward a down payment which is security and first months rent on a small apartment. Although this isnt a full remedy, it is something towards stability for a woman and her three children and getting them on their feet. Everyone has a right to have a safe and stable home for their family and we believe this loving family deserves that. Please consider supporting them as they are facing a real threat of becoming homeless in the next couple weeks. Together, we can prevent this from happening to them. It takes a village. Any amount can help. Your help is much appreciated!

At age 6, I told my mother and her two sister's, that their dad was touching my body. They forced me to keep it a secret from the police and my own dad, but kept bringing me around my grandfather, and allowed the abuse to continue.       Now 20 years later, my 6 year-old daughter and I, speak at schools educating young children about their body, and to tell somebody if they're being hurt, and we're also giving strength to other survivors to tell their story so they can heal.        My daughter and I, are raising moneyto turn our mission and movement into a NON-Profit Organization so we can expand and reach our full potential! Our end goal is to have a ""Tell Somebody"" chapter in EVERY state, and get the help of other survivors to run these chapters and SAVE lives! We NEED YOUR HELP THOUGH! We are asking for donations, as any donation will make a HUGE impact!! Visit my website  www.ItsTimeToTellSomebody.com to watch AMAZING videos of my work! Thank you and God bless!!

I recently returned to my home from a 4 month deployment to find that mylife and family had been turned upside down. I cant get into details at this time, but my house and everything inside have been destroyed. The mother is out of the house at this time and I am at the home with my children. I had to throw out all of my children's bedding and almost all of their toys, dishware, and clothes due to unrine and black mold. Everything from clothing, bedding, dishes, TV's, interior of vehicles, etc. have been ruined/ destroyed. There was minimal food in the home and what was not dry goods was either expired or had mold growing.All of my money has been throw out the window by their mother and there is nothing to show for the money that I earnedwhile I was gone. The children have almost next to nothing and I am doing all I can to provide a clean and safe enviroment. I am not worried about myself at this time and have enough to get by for myself, but I am asking for any kind of help for these two beautiful children! The children are Xzavier (4yr) and Aubree (2yr) and theythank you for giving thema second chance.The donated funds will also be used for retaining fees for an attorney and any court costs.

 https://www.gofundme.com/2qy9amc Original text from Rick:Cousins ,Hope all well. Many of you might not know this, but Tia Lupe's roof in the back room where she showers has fallen and has a huge hole. Francine Frances Bunker David Omar Tio Jorge and I have been talking about fixing the roof windows and fence for her. Today, Bunker is coming to Hebbronville with the materials he and David Omar bought. Came to around $900. We are asking all the cousins (not the tos or tias) to help out with the labor. I know times are tough. But anything will help. Euni will be making a gofund me acct on the Herrera Facebook page. The goal for project 1 is $1000. This will pay for the labor. This will speed up the collection and make it easier for everyone to use their cards if needed. If any of the money is left, we will carry it over for project 2 and 3. We will leave the gofundme acct open for further family projects. Project 2 will be the windows. The wood around them is rotten. It's hard for her to keep the house cool or warm. Project 3 will be he fence. The poles have now rusted out and some are rusted completely rusted through. Please join us and help our Tia Lupe with the house. We will continue to keep you posted on the progress. We will try to post pictures of the work. Thank you. Love y'all Rick. #herrerastrongYour donations ( in any amount) are GREATLY appreciated!

                        So let me start off by saying thank you for at least considering donating to this fund to help us.I know how difficult the decision to donate money can be, especially to people you don't know. Being on the other side I can tell you, for me, it's just as hard having to ask for donations as well. It takes someone with a big heart and a act of pure kindness to donate to these kinds of funds. My husband and I both are praying that whoever is reading this finds it inside their heart to help us with even the smallest of donations, as every $1 makes such a tremendous difference in our life and you'll never know how much every $1 means to us! Here's our story: My name is Brandi Stanberry. After a few years of trying to get pregnant and having no success, my husband and I decided to start the long and stressful fertility process. I kept my mind open to what the results could be but nothing could prepare me for what the doctor had in the vanilla folder that had our name on it. Yes, some of what I'm about to tell you is reallypersonal butI believe if I'm willing to ask you to donate to our fund, then I need to atleast humble myself and tell you exactlywhat's going on.Many who know me might remember back about 5 years ago when I contracted a deadly bacterial infection from Tybee waters. By the time I realized I wasn't just sick and got to the hospital, doctorstold my parentsI had about 1 hour left to live before my body shut down. Apparently, while in the water a bacteria, that Tybee waters tested positive for, got into a blister on my toe and even worse the tampon I currently had in had absorbed the same bacteria thus infecting my body.Doctor's feared I wasnt going to survive but continued to run tests to figure out what I had and how to treat it. After being hospitalized for over a month, doctor's finally released me.Even though I hadfrequent ER visits thereafter,and thepain of them having to pull bone marrow, preform a liver biopsy, exploratory surgery, MRI's, spinal taps was still fresh in my mind. But after finding out that 3 other people who contracted the same bacterial infection on the East coast died within 3 months of my infection,Iwas then just thankful to stillbe alive.Finally, with the support and prayers of everyone around me, I miraculously pulled through and recovered.I thought all the painthis infection hadcaused me wasfinally over. But I was wrong. The first thing our fertility doctor want to do was check to see if I had any permanent scaring on my tubes from the infection I had years ago. If I did, In-Vitro would be our only option to have kids. My heart dropped as the thought of that infection could possibly affect my will to have children whet through my mind. So an HSG test was performed. As my husband and I waited impatiently in our room to hear the results I prayed that God would prepare me for whatever news I was about to hear. Doctor walked in and said, ""Good news, both tubes are open and no scaring."" You could hear two sighs of relief as my husband and I both exhaled the breath we had been holding. We still had more test that had to be done, but from what I understood this was the most important one at that time. Weeks went by waiting for lab work results. And when my TSH levels were a little high, it was back to the doctors office to do the blood work all over again. On the other side of things Chrishad to go through one semen analysis after another.Similar problems were occurring with him as well. Results were not good. So we scheduled an appointment to have more blood drawn and another semen analysis done a month later. The doctor went ahead and explained what IUI and IVF was so that we would at least be walking out of her office that day with some new knowledge. In short, they both are procedures to help woman get pregnant. IUI costing around $3000-$5000 and basically helps the woman ovulate at a specific time andhelps by assissting thesperm reach the egg, taking about 17-20 days for pregnancy. IVF costing anywhere between $10,000-$27,000 and is a lot more complicated and taking up to 4 months for pregnancy. Good news was IUI was definitely still an option at this point because we already knew my tubes were clear and that was the main threat of having to do IVF. The stress we both were under at this point was still overwhelming. But some of the stress fell away because we at least had the news that IUI was a definite option and even though it would be tough, we knew we could afford that procedure. Then I got a phone call from the Fertility Clinic. Results from my most resent lab work were in and Chris's most resent semen analysis numbers were high enough to answer some questions about whats been going on. I was so relieved and excited. Tuesday came around and off to the clinic we were. We sat down in our doctors office and I was feeling pretty excited because I thought the worse thing she could tell us was that we would have to do IUI, which we both had prepared ourselves for. However, that wasnt the case. Turns out the infection I had did in fact affect my body's ability to have kids. It sped upthe aging of my eggs. So even though Im 27, my eggs are like 37 years old. On top of that my husband has an extremely high amount of abnormally shaped sperm. So what does this mean? Basically, my bodys ability to produce fertile eggs is decreasing at an unknown rate. And my husbands abnormal sperm is blocking any normal sperm from reaching my tubes, thus causing IUI to no longer be an option. She explained that with our situation IVFhas a 70%-80% success rate of us becoming parents which issignificantly higherthan our chances with IUI. On top of her reminding us how much IVF cost, she continues to tell us that while we need to take time to decide what we want to do, we also need to remember that my eggs are steadily aging and once they become infertile my chances of becoming pregnant drop to zero. So if we do decide to proceed with In-Vitro, we should start immediatley while I still have fertile eggs.I felt like I couldnt breath. I could feel little needle like stings around my eyes as I tried to hold back the tears. I just wanted to leave because I knew I wasnt going to be able to hold it together much longer. I couldnt help to think that the dream of playing ball with my little boy or girl may not ever come true. After, finding out that our insurance doesnt cover any part of the IVF procedure I felt even more scared. After praying and talking with family though, I've come to realize things could be a lot worse. So many ways to raise money has crossed my mind. Softball tournaments, car wash,etc but because we have such an urgency to start the process as soon as possible, Go Fund Me seemed like the best way to raise money the quickest. The IVF procedure cost$14,357.00 plus the cost of medicine and anesthesia which we were told could be anywhere from $2000-$5000. Totaling out around $20,000. With the help from both of our families, I believe we will be capable of paying for half of this procedure but we are humbly asking for anyone who can help with the restto please do so. We are praying for any donation that you could spare to help make this possible. This truly means the world to us as you will be helping to give us life. We will never be able to thank you enough!! If we do get the money raised then hopfully in 4 months we'll beexpecting a perfectlittle angel to complete our family.

His brother, only 3 years old, is struggling to adjust to a new way of life where he sees his brother sick and unable to come home with him and play. We are praying that he gets well and the chemo will be successful. If at all possible, please donate to help Braylon and his young family during this difficult time.

I have a lawyer that specializes in this type of case. But it comes at a cost. Please help me bring Daray home.

Trying to raise money to come back to oregon. We are in arizona and we had to come out here due to being homeless. I just want to be back home with my church family and friends. We have plans to live with a close friend in gladstone. im currently looking for work in that area. I have to start from square 1. My ex kicked out my daughter and I on the streets. We slept in my car and on floors of friends. While i was looking for a safe place to stay for my 3 year old daughter and I, he took all of our belongings to goodwill. clothes, toys, valuables, EVERYTHING. We have nothing but the clothes on our backs. I have to raise this money to start over. Anything helps. Im giving it all to God and praying for a safe return home. If you are not able to donate money please pray for us. thank you all in advance.

                        Berhanu and I got married three years ago. We decided to wait a year to start our family but that was not the plan God had for us. We went through a very rough time when we lost our son but God had a different path for us to take. We know and trust that God can give us a child by conception when he chooses but in the meantime, he has put it on our hearts to adopt. Adoption has been a desire on our hearts even before we met and married, and over the past few months it has been clear that we should move ahead with our plans. After a great deal of consideration, and suggestions from several people, we've decided to start a Go Fund Me page to give one child the jump start at the life they never had before! It was a difficult decision for Berhanu and me to ask for help, but we've come to realize that it's not just about the two of us anymore...So, would you consider helping us out by donating towards our adoption? It takes a community to raise a baby and we want that to be the case from beginning to end with our child. If you have any questions or would like to talk about a different way of donating other than the means provided here on the GoFundMe page, please contact us directly. Here is a breakdown of how the money you donate will be used:1. We need to move to a bigger place before we can adopt and in Ethiopia they require about 6 months rent in advance; plus we have to fix the place ourselves so: $25002. Home study after we apply: $1500We humbly ask you to help with any donation you see fit. We will be putting these donations in a separate bank account set aside solely for the adoption expenses that we will incur during this process. If a donation is something you are able to do please know what that means to us and our family. Even if a donation is not possible, we appreciate your thoughts, support and prayers. Please feel free to share our story with friends and family.Much love,Berhanu and Zoe

                        Chad and I have been married since August 8, 2008.  Since that day we have been trying to have a child.  After 15 months of naturally trying, we were diagnosed with unspecified infertility.  While stationed in El Paso, TX I underwent two surgeries and 2 failed IUI cycles.  Once back in McKinney, TX we underwent more testing, I had two more surgeries, and finally a Reproductive Endocrinologist diagnosed me with low AMH, which means my eggs are the age of someone in their 50's  Since that diagnosis in April 2013, we have gone through 4 cycles of injectible medications.  We were informed on December 9, 2013 that our final chance with injectibles had failed.  The only other option for us to have a child together is to do In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).  This procedure is not covered by insurance and costs upward of $10,000.  We have come to the point that we need donations to cover the procedure.  My doctor has already told me that I will need another surgery (which will be covered by insurance), then we will need to immediately begin the IVF journey.  The cost of the IVF cycle is required up front and we are in a time crunch; there is no way to tell when my eggs will ""expire.""  As of today, I have 256 Facebook friends and Chad has 169.  If each one of you donated just $20, we could be over half way to our goal! Any and all donations are appreciated more than you will ever know. Donations can be made in your name or can be anonymous.

                        Currently we are a family of four. Our youngest Nehemiah turned one in May. We found out we are expecting again Feb. 3rd. This would be our third child. My husband and I both drive cars and two baby car seats (we tried), do not fit in our vehicle. We really need a Family vehicle. We looked into a van so the kids can have the space they need and we wont have to travel in separate cars. I had currently traded in my bigger vehicle since it was such a gas guzzler and money was tight, only to find out that we were expecting. So we are upside down on this...unless we can come up with the difference and get the family van we need. I usually would not ask for help from anyone, but we can't afford an $800/month car payment if we trade being upside down. My husband is working as much as he can going in at 2:30 am and working till late at night. Putting in long hours to try and help towards this goal as am I. But even with all our working, We can not raise 11,000 before the baby arrives. With afterschool care fees. Drs fees. Daycare. Plus bills. Please anything helps and if you do donate. Thanks so much for blessing us with your help to be one step closer to our family Van. Thanks, The Robertsons

Help us Pay the Cost of Birth,"$5,372 ","$9,000 ",Family," February 25, 2014",25,31,GALENA,IL,101000,,6,"

                        We are a family of three (soon to be four) living in northwest Illinois. We are hardworking people. Larissa is a librarian at the local public library and Matthew is a computer programmer and 3D graphics designer who works from home.We found out we were expecting our second child this past summer and we were very excited! Soon afterwards we realized that we were uninsured and finding affordable care was going to be very difficult. Niether of us received insurance from our workplaces.As we explored the options, my first choice was to use a midwife. Unfortunately, midwives are illegal in Illinois so unless we could find someone's home in Iowa or Wisconsin in which to give birth, the midwife we found could not help us.We wanted to avoid option number two. When our daughter was born, we used Illinois Medicaid. We had to travel two hours to the clinic that would accept the Medicaid--the clinic that was in Iowa to boot. Not only did we travel so far, but the level of care and empathy was unacceptable. We felt that we had no choice in our healthcare at all. We were shuffled from test to test with little explanation. When I was five days overdue I was forced into being induced and again given very little explanation. I wanted this pregnancy and birth to be as positive an event as possible.I called another nearby clinic only to find out that I was not in their Medicaid ""service area"" and they could not treat me. I asked if we could pay cash until we figured out what our plan was and they told me no since I was elligible for Medicaid, they could not take cash.The midwife we spoke with recommended a family practice and hospital in Wisconsin. It was only about 45 minutes away and she called them a ""friendly,"" meaning they would work with me on the insurance isssue. I made an appointment with them and began to look into purchasing an individual insurance plan with maternity care.While I was receiving exactly the kind of empathetic and informative care I was looking for during maternity, I was calling insurance companies and attempting to purchase an affordable package. This was right before the ""Affordable Care Act"" was to take effect. I was told to wait until I could ""shop"" the Marketplace after October 1st. October 1st came and went and I was unable to use the website because of all the gliches on it's launch date. Finally towards the end of December, I was able to make an account and go through the application.What I found out was that I did not fall into the income bracket that would allow me to purchase a Marketplace plan. It was either Medicaid or paying full price for the new plans, which ran $200 - $300 a month for the premiums and had at least $6,000 deductibles. These insurance companies would not take my money and I calculated that after I paid the deductible and the premium every month, it would be less expensive for me just pay the hospital.The next step was to talk with the hospital. They recommended that I apply for a program they have that would waive a portion of or the entire cost of delivery. Since I was eligible for Medicaid in Illinois, I would be a special case. They gave me hope saying that perhaps the state of Illinois would cover the costs since my case was strange. I turned in the application and about three weeks later (four days before my due date) received a letter denying my application because I am eligible for Medicaid and therefore can deliver elsewhere.So after all that, we are back to square one and could deliver any day now. The options at this point are (1) deliver in the terrible hospital that is two hours away (2) wait until delivery is right about to happen and deliver in a closer hospital ER (3) deliver as planned in Wisconsin and pay $800 a month for the next year which is the most unrealistic of all since I have no idea where that money would come from, or (4) deliver as planned and pay the bill within 25 days to receive a 25% discount.The last option is what we are asking for help accomplishing. We have decided to choose our healthcare instead of being forced into a system and we are trying our hardest to follow through with this choice. Even with the discount the birth will cost an estimated $9,000.Please consider making a small donation toward this cause. Please help us keep our ability to make choices involving our healthcare and the care of our soon to be born baby.

                        At first, I was hesitant and even embarrassed to create a gofundme account yet alone post it onto my facebook. I've never been the type to ask for help, I have always handled difficult situations on my own. Realisticly I cannot do this on my own so I sucked up my pride and now I am asking my facebook family and friends for help. I do absolutely need it and sometimes you have to just realize that there is nothing wrong with expressing you need help. Jaylen is going to be starting school this year and I wanted to pick a good area as well as a good school district for him to begin his school year. As some of you know, Jada got pnemonia earlier this year and unfortunately I missed so much work that I did end up loosing my job. I decided that it was time for me to go back to school and finish to become a dental hygientist being that I only have one year left to get into the program. I felt it was worth the sacrifice for my kids to have a better future. I do not currently have a 9-5 position but I do support myself by doing uber and lyft as well as postmates and I literally work every day and every night as well as attend school.I completed my lease and am currently month to month and have already submitted my thirty day notice because I knew I would be moving soon due to Jaylen starting school.I found a place and was approved...everything was good to go. My move in cost came out to a little over $1200 and I was prepared to come up with that amount.  Being that I do not have a consistent pay check as a normal 9-5 job would have I made arrangements with my apartment to pay last months rent as well as my prorated rent. There was no way on my own I would be able to pay double rent on top of other bills. LastWednesday,I recieved a phone call from the new apartment that I was approved for the apartment and everything was good for me to move in this Saturday (July 16, 2016). On Monday, I recieved another phone call saying that they see that I have not paid my current rent so I can not move until it is paid. I also just found out today that I have a crack on my exhaust manifold on my vehicle which is going to cost an additional $500 and right now that is obviously the only way I make money so it needs to be fixed. So to sum things up , I need the money by this Saturday in order to move in or I will loose the apartment. Any contribution towards the amount that needs to be raised will truly be greatly appreciated. Even if you are not able to help me financially just a word of motivation will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this! God Bless.

Help my Dad fight for Custody. ,$240 ,"$5,000 ",Family," September 23, 2016",10,2,CHICAGO,IL,87000,,1,"

CHICAGO, IL                                




Hello everyone,


I am setting up this donation page for my father Ed Rivera. He is unaware that I am doing this. But he really needs all the help he can get right now and this is the best way I could think of that will make a real difference.


So here is the situation we find ourselves in...

Just a little back story: 
2 years ago, my father went though a horrible 3 year divorce battle with his now Ex- Wife. After spending thousands of dollars to finalize the contested divorce, it all came to an end about 2 years ago. Things were beginning to look up after losing almost everything in this divorce. The extensive court costs were almost finally paid off! Aside from losing most of his personal possesions, his Ex wife had sole custody of his now 14 yr old Daughter (My sister) who he continues to pay child support for.


After the divorce was finalized, My fathers Ex wife remarried about a year and a half after the finalization of the divorce. Her new husband had my fathers Ex wife and his daughter (My sister) come move in with him in Palos Hills. This is were they currently live.


Now this is where things start to get bad again...

Thanks to a good samaritan who, to this day stayed anonymous, (We really have no idea who this amazing person watching over our family was, but we would like to graciously thank them) sends my dad a strange letter. It was typed out, with no stamp or return address. It was dropped in his mailbox one day. Some anonymous person tipped my father off to a secret that his ex wife intentionally kept from my father.


The letter stared off with "" Your ex wife has a new husband. We thought you should be aware of this situation for the safety of your daughter."" Confused, My dad flips to the next page to see his ex wifes new husband's mugshot.


Under the mug shot, his charges read:


""Convicted Sex offender of a 13 yr old child.""
Who we come to find out was his biological daughter.
He was convicted of his daughters rape and did 9 years in a Texas Prison. After he was released from prison in Texas, he fled to Illinois where he now lives with my sister and her mother.


My father reached out to his ex wife to get to the bottom of this because now he is fully concerned for his daughters safety and for his daughters female friends safety knowing that she has had sleepovers with her friends inside of this mans home, breaking the rules of his sex offender registry.


She claimed that she knew about his conviction and it is OK and that he didnt really do it. (But you dont go to Prison for 9 years if you are innocent) My father who was now definately worried about his daughters safety living with this convicted rapist with whom his daughter is alone with while his ex wife works.


He told her he wants his daughter to come stay with him for a while until all of this is sorted out. She then denied him stating that ""Your daughter and I are happy here. She isnt going anywhere and she is not going to come stay with you."" After firmly debating, it was clear that she wasnt budging nor would she willingly allow my father to take my sister into a household with guaranteed safety. So my father was left with no choice but to take things back to court to fight for sole custody of his daughter and for her overall wellbeing and safety.


My father had to spend more than $1000 just to start the court motion for custody change. He was also informed that he will have to pay 2/3 of his daughers lawyer (who was needed to represent her best interest). Which he felt he had to do, because no amount of money mattered to him as long and he had the peace of mind knowing that his daughter was in safe hands once again. He needed to ensure that something irreversably damaging to her physical and mental state would never occur to his one and only daughter. My father was in the process of finalizing a deal on a new house in Oak Forrest to accomodate the space and the needs of his daughter if he were to win custody. It was a time sensitive deal that depended on the sole fact of whether or not he will be able to have custody of his daughter.


Court date after court date, his ex wifes lawyer continued to use stall tactics to buy more time to attempt to combat this motion. Right when we thought the court was going to side in my fathers favor and grant him custody and the ability to finalize the deal on the new home, they dropped a bombshell on us. His ex wife will now be divorcing her new husband of a few months to stall the decision further forcing all of us to have to take things to trial by Jury. With this now forcing the final decision to be postponed, The chances of my father getting the new home for the family is very slim.


Since the initial custody court date, (which began only about 2 months ago) He has now accrued $6700 (aside from the $1000 required to even begin the motion) in court and lawyer fees to pay for himself and his daughters lawyer. The Trial begins at the end of this month (September) and will go on for an unknown amount of time until a decision is made. This unexpected custody battle has been draining my father of every penny he has. He has been working double shifts every day for weeks at a time to get enough money to pay for this custody battle while still tying to survive on a daily basis. He didnt wish for it to have to come to this but he feels that he has no choice other than to ensure that his daughter is safe and out of the hands of his ex wife who has time and time again shown to make horribly poor decisions with the new strange men she has continued to bring around his daughter for the past 4 years.


We have no way of gauging how much more this battle will cost him and he really is in need of help. He will never ask for it himself, which is why I decided that this donation page might be the best way to help in any way possible.


It hurts me deeply to see my father struggling so hard to fight for what we all know is the right decison for his daughters future. I see the inner turmoil within him as each court date is delayed, costing him more and more money that he doesn't have. I see him struggle to make ends meet with such an unexpected and costly battle. He will continue to bust his ass everyday at work for more than 12 hrs a day until his daughter is back home with him again, finally being able to rest easy once more.


Any donation would make an unbelievably positive impact on our family and my father specifically. Especially if anyone were to help in anyway. All money raised will go directly towards court costs and to assist a better life for my sister.


A small donation will go a very long way to help us make this nightmare finally cease and not have to constantly be concerned with the financial and emotional strain this has caused to date. Let alone the costs we will be faced with once trial begins this month.


Honestly and truly, every single penny raised will be greatly and humbly appreciated.


No donation is too small. Anything raised will be treasured and respected. Even if you are unable to donate, please share this to reach as many people as possible. My father deserves this for the hard work and the struggle he deals with. 


So thank you all for listening to this story that we continue to live daily. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. The only question I pose is ""To what lengths would you go to ensure the safety of your daughter/sister/son/brother/father/mother?""


-Nico Rivera

HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA                                





                        Hi My name is Sean. I have seen my mom and dad go through a lot of hard times. I asked my uncle to help me help them. This is my mom's story: I've decided to share my sweet Manolo with the world. Celebrate his sweet face and love he's brought to us. Our baby boy was diagnosed with LUTO (Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction) at the early age of 15 gestational weeks. We where given one choice, terminate the pregnancy because his survival rate was poor, he wouldn't even be born alive. We couldn't do that. We decided to carry our baby for as long as he would let me and hope we would get to meet him and hold him. Every time I went to the doctor I prayed for a misdiagnosis and a heartbeat.Even though all the test came back so negative and I felt like a human lab rat, we still didn't loose hope to be able to hold our baby. I am grateful enough to have been able to feel him kick and move and all the discomfort in the world was worth it. We knew he would arrive early and he might not be alive but I kept on going. He tortured me (contractions) for two weeks before he decided to make his grand entrance and even then I was in labor for almost 24 hrs before he decided it was time. At 31 weeks, and surrounded by my two other loves, Ellis and Sean, Manolo blessed us with his presence at 11:57 pm on June 13, 2016 and to our surprise he came kicking and screaming!! No one will ever understand the amount of love and pure happiness hearing his sweet voice brought US. He let me hold him and comfort him while his daddy and big brother stood right beside us for One hour and 26 minutes. He was the spitting image of his big brother and a dream come true for our family. Although everything that came after has been hard, these are the moments I will carry with me forever. Holding my baby surrounded by my family. I share this because I want to celebrate Manolo's life and the love he brought us, I love talking to people about Manolo. I love sharing his pictures and videos. I love that my son was there to witness his birth and even cut his umbilical cord with his daddy. I love that Mannys grandparents where there all day just catch a glimpse. I love the love he has received. I love everything about Manolo and the wonderful memories he gifted us. RIP Manolo J. McClure. I can feel you with me everyday baby! Today, my mom received a bill from the hospital. She did not say anything. I knew she was troubled. I am having a hard time understanding why she is going through so much right now. One thing after another. Please help my parents who do not say anything but I know they need help and want ask for it to get their head above water. Thank you very much.

Please Help Me See My Baby!!,$325 ,$450 ,Family," September 24, 2016",9,1,FLINT,MI,136000,1,2,"

FLINT, MI                                





                        It is such a long story!! You can read all of it at  www.facebook.com/FreeAmayiahThe short version is that I have been made a victim of DHS in Michigan. My ex (and the biological father to my babies) was cheating on me while I was pregnant with our baby. As if that wasn't bad enough, she is a CPS worker. He kicked me out & I was pregnant and homeless during a brutal winter so he could play house with him new fling. Since there were already bogus CPS allegations that we didn't know how to fight, he tried using the easy way out by dating his sister's best friend behind my back so her (she used to work for CPS, but from what I hear, playing house with someone who has an open CPS case and has pled no contest for child abuse and neglect is grounds for dismissal) and her mother who is a placement supervisor for CPS could pull strings and help him take the easy way out.  Meanwhile, I was pregnant with his child and he wanted nothing to do with the baby when he found out I was having a girl. The last few years of my life have been one tragedy after another. Both of my brothers committed suicide and many other close friends and family passed away in a very short time. He played games throughout my pregnancy, swearing he would be there for me and the baby and then disappearing for weeks on end. He even spent our older baby's 1st birthday at the bar with his girlfriend.  I did not want to make this to bash him, so I will cut to the chase. I have him numerous opportunities to get to know his daughter, but he declined and said, ""Not interested,"" every time I offered and blocked my phone number so that I couldn't reach him anymore. Meanwhile, his gf & her mother used their connections to make sure I had a CPS case open on me on at least a monthly basis. They constantly accused me of doing drive and I passed every single drug test with flying colors.  He did not show up to sign the birth certificate because he was afraid his girlfriend would get mad at him. So for nearly 2 years I struggled to raise my baby alone. After all of the losses I endured, my baby was the one bright spot in my life. I never left her side. I never got a babysitter. I felt so blessed to have this amazing little girl. We were so happy together!! But when the false complaints didn't work, they sent workers from a different county to come take my daughter on ""drug suspicions."" My baby was perfectly safe and we were at my friend's house who is a teacher in a really nice neighborhood. They brought 3 state police cars with 2 officers each. When they told me the charges, I was somewhat relieved because I knew there were no drugs in my system and that I just DO NOT do drugs, period. I asked to take a drug test on the spot. But they still took my baby, saying it takes a few days for the results to come back. When the results came back, they were negative, of course! But they did not return my child to me. They made an amended petition saying that the REAL reason they took her now was because I was in the hospital when I was 19 and 20 years old for depression. I am now 35 years old and I have not had any recent issues. My daughter was always very well taken care of. She had everything her heart could desire. I did not just sign my life away and give up on my child. I demanded a jury trial to prove my innocence and prove that I am a fit parent. I won my jury trial. The jury took less than 5 minutes to deliberate. So I thought my problems were over. I had taken care of my sweet girl on my own for almost 2 years. When she was born I walked from the peri-natal unit to the NICU to nurse and be with my daughter so many times my feet had blisters starting just hours after my emergency c-section. The 5 days that I was in the hospital after a very scary birthing experience that nearly killed us both because of preeclampsia was spent next to my baby in the NICU. They used their CPS connections to try getting my beautiful daughter taken from me immediately after her birth. Once again, they said I was on drugs, but the meconium testing goes back at least 5 months and all was clean. I had everything I needed for my daughter and a safe place for us to live, so they did not take her. After at least 10 investigations that I passed every single time, they got frustrated and a different county came and ripped her away from me. This was just before Christmas last year. They put my sweet girl in foster care where she was physically abused in the worst ways and came to our visits with new bruises, cuts, scrapes, bumps, and rashes every single week. I wanted to take away all of her pain and fear, but I had to wait for the wheels of justice to turn. Finally I was cleared of all charges. Just days before I was cleared, DHS ordered a paternity test from my ex and sent her there for 3 days. His jealous girlfriend wanted to keep her just to hurt me. The courts ordered them to return my daughter to me ASAP & custody would be decided at a later date. I had her for a week and he took her again and refused to give her back. I have not seen my any since June. My baby is nearly 2 and a half years old. They have only known her 3 months. Because of the pull they have in this county, they seem to be invincible. I have my ex several chances to be a part of his daughter's life. He doesn't want that. He wants to edge me out and keep my daughter in an extremely immoral household just to see how much pain he can cause me. I have already won against the state and I should have had my baby back a long time ago. It is breaking me to pay all of my own bills, plus lawyer fees and everything else. I had court today and they agreed to give me supervised visitations. But I need to come up with $200 down and $25 an hour to pay this outside supervisor. I should have a visit on Sunday, but I have no idea how to come up with the money I need to visit my baby. I never got child support or state assistance for her. I don't like to ask for money. I find it incredibly embarrassing!! But if it will bring me one step closer to my baby, I will happily ask. If anyone has any questions or would like me to clarify anything, I will be happy to do so. More information can be found on Amayiah's Facebook page at:  www.facebook.com/FreeAmayiahPlease find it in your heart to help reunite us. She is all that I have and my entire world revolves around her and has since she was born. She is as much of a mama's girl as I've ever seen. We have always been extremely close & I know she misses me as much as I miss her. She was put through horrendous abuse in state care that made me feel like my heart was being ripped out. Her ""father"" has been absentee up until July when the paternity test was ordered and he realized he would have to pay child support if he didn't just keep her. It is costing every extra dime I have to pay my lawyer, but my short term goal is to be able to pay the supervisor to watch our visits. Please, anything helps!! She is my heart and I need to hold her close to me again! www.facebook.com/FreeAmayiah

Toby's Adoption,"$3,575 ","$8,600 ",Family," June 12, 2016",36,3,FOUNTAIN VALLEY,CA,601000,1,5,"






                            Sarah A'Court
                            
                            
                                                           
FOUNTAIN VALLEY, CA                                





                        This picture is of Toby and Luke (Toby is on the left). It was taken candidly when they weren't looking. They are technically cousins but are more like brothers. Toby is my nephew. His mom (my sister) passed away Christmas Day 2012. I was living in the UK at the time with my kids Luke and Samara. The death of his mom was understandably devastating for the family/Toby. Grandma became guardian through the kinship program until I could move back to the USA. Grandma felt she needed help. I have taken over custody of Toby as of August 2013. He's been part of my family and loves his cousins dearly, and we love him. We want Toby to be a part of our family forever and don't want him in the system. My hope for Toby is to have him as an adopted son and this is his wish too. It's hard to ask for help; but we need it. As a single mom of 3 in Orange county I can just afford the basic cost of life and don't have anything extra for the cost of adoption. This is where the public come in. The adoption process in this situation is lengthy and expensive. We really want this to happen as soon as possible! I have looked into who can help us legally and have found a good paralegal service in Orange County California (where we live). They have explained the process in detail to me and the wait for the process to be completed is a minimum of 6 months, with a 3 month follow up after. The cost is $4500 (but they reduced it to $3000 because of our situation). This is for the paperwork from beginning to end; then ""signing fees"" of anywhere between $800-$1100, and the cost of what they call ""home study"" for $4500 which is done by social services. There is also a background check fee that the county will charge us (even though we are related!). It totals around $8600 altogether. This is our families dream. I can't emphasize how much this would mean to all of us. Once the adoption is complete we would have the opportunity to take our picture together (as a official family!) in the court. Please help us make our dream a reality. We want it to be official. He's Luke and Samaras brother regardless of who his biological parents are. We love Toby.... Please help us share and spread the word. Thank you!

                        After graduating from college with her Master's degree my wife got a job in TN. When we arrived, my job informed me that I could no longer transfer my position and that I was on my own. We sold off our second vehicle and my wife has been working her new job while I have been interviewing for several positions in the area. Despite this, our landlord just delivered the news that we need to pay the rest of September rent ($900) by Monday or they file for eviction with the help of a collections agency. They would be asking for the rest of September's rent, October's rent, collection fees, attorney fees, and court costs. Therefore, we need to find $900 by Monday or face thousands of dollars in costs to keep our apartment. We feel overwhelmed and have considered every option on our own before asking others for help.

                        How does one begin a story of a life lost? How do I properly express to you, the Reader of who I am and how vulnerable my life has become? How do I create a photograph of how degrading and torturous and perverse my life has been since choices were made for me and for my children with no thought to one's family. I can't disappear as others have done. I have a responsibility to my children. They do not have a voice. I need to be that voice. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY and know that we are alone and this is real and very scary. No lessons need to be learned or taught. No one deserves this. As of September 20, 2016, the kids and I are Homeless. We have no money for gas or for food. We are penniless. My food stamp allotment of 187.00 does not drop in until October 4th. My Social Security does not become available until the 28th of this month. The amount is 473.00. There is no money to buy groceries. There is no money to do laundry. I have not done my laundry since June. . One never realizes the importance of personal hygiene until you have no personal space and no hygiene. I barely recognize myself anymore. Not easy to know that I am not anything like I once was. This is not what I asked for. Not what I worked for or expected. A life carved out for me that I did not ask for. A history that shall define me. I miss the girl that I knew. I am shattered, betrayed and devoid of hope.PLEASE, if you are able to donate 5.00 or 10.00 to this page, then my children have that much more of a chance. And, in turn please email a friend, who will pay it forward. From there, pray that we find the foundation, we so desperately need. My world shattered and the silence has been deafening..In one day, my life changed because of another's choices. And the many people I shared my love of moments with turned away from me and from the kids. We have been struggling with no end in sight. My daughter needs to see a doctor and I need to see a doctor. Basic survival is a minute by minute ordeal. I try to explain to the children that life is not always how it plays out or how a parent may paint a picture to other families, but more importantly, we have each other. God has given me a few friends who have championed us along the way. Without these friends, my voice would be silent. The day demands so much. For my children...I thank you.Kasey Gittleman

There was an emergency hearing concerning the childrens safety this afternoon. We attended of coarse to support our daughter in law being CPS got involved. For you all that dont know my step son Bobby had a warrant in Baltimore City and refused to go with the police once they tried serving it. He then barricaded himself in the house with his 2 year old son. This is a bit overwhelming mentally and financially. Unfortunately, they ONLY have what u see in the picture above. All their clothes, beds, furniture, etc were ruined by tear gas. This is life changing for my husband and I to say the least!!! New schools, new rules, new routines, new everything. Having a baby is definetly gonna be a challenge. I am usually always the one to help people and I just cant imagine how I will get my house set up for a 13, 8, and 2 year old. I really truly need help. WE need help. I know in time I can get some assistance from the State but right now I needs beds, bed linens, diapers, food, childcare, clothes and soo much more. Please if any way you can help us WE would GREATLY appreciate it. Again, I wouldnt dare ask for help but I truly do need it. I dont even know where to begin..honestly!!

                        Jesses & Kimberlys Adoption Journey! Help us keep this family togetherThank you so much for visiting our page! As you probably know, we are on the wonderful journey of adopting Hunter and Rion. These girls have brought so much love and joy to our family. Adoption is a big step for us, and we have been going full throttle since obtaining custody of the girls last September (we are not fostering). We would love it if you were a part of our journey. How you can help:1. The Power of Prayer: First and foremost, please pray for us! Although this is wonderful, it is also very stressful. We desperately need prayer throughout this journey as our goal is keeping these girls happy, healthy, safe, and part of our family. They are so happy!!2. Giving: Asking for financial help is very hard, but we realize that its needed. As you can imagine, retaining a lawyer is very expensive. Any amount you can give is greatly appreciated and definitely helps us out in a big way. 3. Spread the Word: As we all know, word spreads quickly through social media and word of mouth; therefore, we would greatly appreciate it if you could spread the word to your friends and family or share our page to encourage others to share in this wonderful journey.Jesse and I want to thank you so much for your support from the beginning of this journey and your continued support. We definitely couldnt do it without the love of our family and friends. If you decide you can give, dont be shy. Please leave us your name and maybe some encouragement (if you so desire). We want you to be a part of this journey forever; and sharing this experience with Hunter and Rion when they get older will be very special to them. As I always say to those that ask, the girls are happy and very much loved and thats what matters the most. They have a mommy and daddy that love them so much, a big brother that loves them and they love him (even though he drives them crazy), and a dog that is super protective. There are also several grandmothers, grandfathers, grand-daddies, aunts, uncles, cousins, new family members, and many others that are so special to us (leaving private out of respect for them). And of course, YOU  you will forever be a part of our family and this most wonderful journey! Again, thank you so much!

                        Welcome family, friends, and those whom may not know us to our story and our dream. Nathan and I have been married for 14 years and have two amazing boys, but we have always wanted to have a larger family. 8 years ago we found out that I had to have a hysterectomy due to having two painful and large fibroid tumors. This news devastated us since we had our hearts set on having a larger family. After a few years,a lot of prayer, and talking we knew that we still wanted to grow our family so we looked at our options. We believe thatGod put adoption on our hearts through our Youth Pastor and his wifeat our church who grew their family through fostering to adopt.We have done a lot of research and weighed our options and have found an amazing adoption agency to help us along on our journey. However, adoption is very expensive and this is where we turn to you and God for help. We ask that if you feel it in your heart and are able to donate whatever you are comfortable with, we greatly appreciate it. If donating is not an option for you we ask that you take a momentto pray for the birth mother that is waiting for the right family for her child, for the wonderful people at the adoption agency we are working with, and for our family as we go along in this journey. Thank you for all your support, donations, and prayers.
God Bless, 
Nathan, Carrie, Ethan, and Caleb

                        We have been married for 11 years and have battled infertility for almost as long. In 2009, through generous support by our families, we were able to do In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and were successful achieving a pregnancy. Sadly, that pregnancy was lost at 17 weeks due to pre-eclampsia. We still have three embryos in storage and are physically and emotionally ready to try again. However, we need help raising money for the procedure costs, medication costs, and storage fees for the remaining embryos. This is our last shot at having our own biological children. Won't you help us achieve our long awaited dream?Cost breakdown:The average cost of a frozen embryo transfer (FET) is between $3,000 and $5,000. We hope to be able to do the FET by summer 2014 and any amount will help us achieve our goal. Thanks so much!Kellie & Troy

                        Ok family and friends I am trying to come up with any fundraising ideas to get us all to see my son graduate BootCamp I know it's almost close to impossible since just to travel alone with airfare n room it's 1800 and to drive about $1000 my loving husband is willing to miss it so I can go but will still cost close to $800 for room, plane ticket and food and a day out with my airmen. If any one knows of any good ideas please let me know! I never had to humble myself and do something like this but with one income and still waiting on my hearing in front of a SSi judge I don't see how it's possible at this point. Please please do not take this as asking for a handout by any means I want to earn it by fundraising. I already have gone thru the kids clothes n shoes as well as mine n have them on a garage sale site. Thank u all for reading this in advance and if your unable to donate even just a $1 just please lift us up in prayer!

                        My boyfriend and I recently had his 4 teenage siblings more in with us (13,14,15,16) after DHR removed them from their home.  It was either have them put in the foster system and separated or  take legal guardianship and keep them together. Clearly we didn't want them separated. We love them all very much. However, having seven children instead of three is a huge difference. We have applied for help from the state but that can take a while. Until then we need help with the incurred cost of rising utility bill, school fees, groceries and unexpected items that always show up. Thank you for your time and help. No amount is to small, everything helps.

Pierson, our very first night as a family!OurStoryWe have been married for 16 years. After 10 years of trying to get pregnant and failed fertility treatments we were led to adopt. We truly felt God's plan for us was to adopt a child. We are so glad we listened!We adopted our first child from St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands. His name is Pierson and he has been the joy in our lives. God hand picked him just for us!We used our 401k to pay for the first adoption and drained it. We have no regrets!
Please Help Us Grow Our Family!We would like our son to have a sibling. As Pierson grows we realize how much he would enjoy having a brother or sister. We are stepping out in faith that we will be able raise the funds to adopt another child. Please help our dreams come true of having another child.

                        Last September, Anthony and I met in Eugene, Oregon. What followed has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. We have been inseparable since, traveling to and from the west to east coast. When we found out I was pregnant, we both knew a huge change was coming. Immediately we started planning for a better future for our child in Oregon. Since we've been here, we both have gotten stable jobs, insurance and have been renting out a room with some friends. As the due date draws near (September 30th), our current housing situation is coming to an end. They need to move a family member in, which we more than understand and appreciate what we have had thus far. That being said, we are saving as much as we can to get our own place, but in order to be fairly close to our work places, the local housing market is really hard right now. More than any toys or other baby items, we need to shelter our child. So even if you can't help much, or you were thinking of getting something small and inexpensive, I request you please put anything toward a house fund for our baby.

CONYERS, GA                                




Hello Michelle,We have read your story and it touched us.  Do not lose hope and pray more! We have thought over it and we are sure you will make out little Manuela happy and we can do whatever it takes for you to adopt her, but the problem is the fee that has to go with the adoption.However, we have contacted some of our sponsors and appealed for help, and they are willing to fund the adoption process until Manuela gets to you. But they will need to know that you have been matched with the little girl and your Application for Adoption has been approved by the Moldovan Ministry of Social Protection, Family and Child Adoption Department. So you will have to try and raise the $2,800.00USD that goes alongside the Application for Adoption. You can refer to our lawyer for more information regarding the Application process.Once we can prove to our sponsor that the adoptive family (you, Dave and Matthew) have been approved by the Moldovan authorities to adopt Manuela from our orphanage, they will pay for the rest of the adoption journey. So if you think this is good news, contact our lawyer as soon as possible for more information regarding the application for adoption process.While waiting to read from you.Warmest Regards,---Sarah KnowlesFalesti Orphanagecoala-Internat / -,Oraul Fleti, MoldovaTel: +373 25922237       +44 7031946564Date: Tue, 23 Jul 2013 18:47:09 -0400 Show quoted textWell as you all have read, those of you that look we have had some major ups and downs. We were getting set for the twins and found out she miscarried. We were set to give up. Then we got the email you just read. Manuela is a year and a half old. I have emailed with the attorney and check the law firm and they are real. Sarah said after the $2800 is done she can be here in less than 3 months. The rest of the money would be to make sure we have what she needs when she arrives. For some reason it is not letting me post her pic, but i will be more than happy to show y'all. At this point we are leaving it in Gods hands, if He wants us to have her we will get the money we need. We will be changing her name. I say all this like I know for sure, I feel in my heart from the first photo I saw that she belongs with us. Thank y'all who have helped and those who have read this. Michelle

We are trusting God 100% to help us make this possible. Our adoption fees are more then half of our yearly income. We know we can not make this happen on our own, but we believe that we can give our child a full and wonderful life! Here in our family he has a big sister and a little brother who long to teach him how to play Candyland and play Thomas the Train with them. He is greatly awaited by grandmas and grandpas,  as well as aunts and uncles ( two of which are also adopted from Korea) who can not wait to make sure he knows how much he is wanted and how deeply he is loved for the rest of his life! He turned 3 years old this June. Everyday that goes by and he is not home, we feel such a loss! We desperately long to never miss another birthday with him or another Christmas. We want to be the ones to comfort him when he is scared, or hold him through the night if he wakes with the flu or an earache.

Help Us Start Our Family,"$1,500 ","$8,500 ",Family," September 12, 2011",12,61,LOS ANGELES,CA,7000,4,11,"






                            Michael L. Smith
                            
                            
                                                           
LOS ANGELES, CA                                







Dear Family and Friends,



As many of you know, soon after Michael and I were married we moved across the U.S. for college and again for Grad school, making new friends along the way. During our nearly 8 years together we have seen many of our dreams come to fruition. We've always felt so blessed to have support, love, amazing advice and words of encouragement from family and friends along the way.



Unfortunately, we have not been able to enjoy the one thing we looked forward to the most--starting a family with a baby of our own.We assumed we would be like other couples and have children while our lives moved forward together. When this didn't happen after a few years, Michael and I began to realize that we might not be like most couples--we may not be able to conceive naturally.



Some of you are aware that I was diagnosed with Endometriosis when I was 18, and had to have surgery when I was 19 for the removal of endometrial cysts on my uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries.I knew that having this condition may cause fertility problems, but I never imagined it would cause more than 7 years of delays and complications for Michael and me. The physicians were hopeful that the surgery would not interfere with conception. Yet as Michael and I tried to start our family, we realized that there must be additional problems. We did what we thought we should; we sought guidance from my physician, we waited, prayed, and kept trying, hoping that things would improve.



In February of this year I sought advice again from a fertility specialist but received disheartening news.My endometriosis had returned causing a cyst the size of a softball on one of my ovaries and a cluster of smaller grape-sized cysts on the other. My physician then informed me that I needed surgery immediately with the possibility that my uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries would need to be removed because my cysts could be cancerous.As difficult as this thought was to me, there were still more questions. How are we going to pay for this?What am I supposed to do now?Do I have cancer? If not, will I ever be able to conceive? Thankfully, surgery went better than we all had hoped. I was informed--with a huge hug from my doctor--that all that needed to be removed were the endometrial cysts. And even better, not one cyst was cancerous! This was amazing news. Our prayers had been answered. But one thought still remained. Conception would be difficult without the aid of fertility treatments, drugs, shots and possibly InVitro Fertilization.



My doctor is hopeful that Intro Uterine Insemination (IUI), a less expensive form of fertilization, could help us start our family, but it may require 2 or 3 procedures before one works. Each individual IUI will cost around $1,500 with an additional $600 for fertility shots.Sadly, this is something we are incapable of doing on our own on a middle-school teacher and student's salary. Our funds have been depleted, and past school loans are preventing us from acquiring any other loans to help with the procedures. And, our insurance will not cover the procedure. If these procedures don't work, we can accept Heavenly Father's plan for us, and begin the adoption process. But that too will require money.



Out of all that the Lord has blessed us with, we have been blessed with the love and generosity of parents who have supported us along the way, offering emotional and financial support, helping to pay for the surgeries that I desperately needed. They helped cover what our insurance wouldn't, and more. Unfortunately, no one tells you when you get married that you should put aside a fertility fund just in case you are one of those people who cannot conceive naturally.



Writing this letter is difficult for me.It has taken a great deal of courage, strength, and humility on my part to share our personal lives in such an open way. It is not something I would normally do, but we feel that we have done all that we can do on our own. The reason we are sharing such personal information with you now is that we hope that as our closest family and friends, you may feel compelled to be a part of our journey, and would like to help us realize our dream for a child of our own.What we can't do alone we hope you may wish to help us accomplish.



We know that times are troubling for everyone, and truthfully I feel almost ashamed to ask for help--especially on such a personal level. But it's amazing what even the smallest contribution could do for us.We understand that this may be too much to ask of some of you.We will not feel offended if you are unable to help. You can leave your words of encouragement and prayers, which are extremely appreciated and will help keep me motivated in this difficult time.Thank you so much for all of your support, help, love and prayers.



We love you all.

Jayna and Michael Smith

                        Hi Everyone My Name is Amie LovedayI set up this Go Fund me Account to raise money so that I can have Invetro Fertilization also known as IVF proceedure done. The money will be used for medications to help support the growth of the eggs along with the support of the envoronment for the Transfer. The money will pay for the proceedure to gather the embryo's, test them and transfer back into the body at the correct time. I would like to have thegoal reached by Setember but really anything by any time would help.My Husband and I have been together for almost 14 years and married almost 4 years out of the 14. A couple of years after marrage we had a desire to have children of our own and tried for several months beforelooking further in seeing a Dr. In 2015 I had to have aproceedure done in which on a follow up appointment my Dr told me that I would not be able to concieve children naturally this broke my heart because I had that desireof starting a family with my husband and the thought of not being able to create what was half of him and half of me brought tears to my eyes.In Febuary of 2016 we meet with a fertility specialistthey gave me hope, hope that i would carry with me for the next 6 months while going threw the process of IVF.Unfortunately this time did not work for us. Ive been told that sometimes it takes several attempts but we are unable to pay the full amount of the treatment a second time and we are not ready to give up. We would appreciate any help that we can get to help our dream come true of having a family.Thank youRodney and Amie Loveday

There have been some struggles when attempting to conceive so they have turned to a fertility specialist to assist in their attempt. Recently they have underwent an IUI and it was unsuccessful. The doctors are adamant on them continuing to do these procedures but due to a financial road block they are unable to do this every month as it costs $1300+ after all is said and done. Any donation  to help them continue on this path will be greatly appreciated.

                        While getting around isn't hard enough, our family's only car was involved in a hit and run adding additional damage to our car alongside no working ac, only one working window, ect. Overall we need help raising enough money so we can have a reliable car for us and our children.

                        Hello, I moved to Florida in April. It has been hard on me and my children to get back home to our family and supporters. It has been rough trying to do everything on my own here with two babies and it feels like I'm getting no where. I just need enough donations to take the greyhound and to cover diaper and food expenses. This is my only option at the moment. Please find it in your heart to help us home where we need to be. Thank you and God bless.

Tormohun Ward, ENG                                





                        I didn't really want to do this in the fisrt place, but I guess life happens in between and it gives me no other choice. My name is Valika Durecov and I'm a 24 year old mum to my gorgeous sweet little angel who's name is Samuel. We live in Slovakia - a little european country with my partner. Things were never easy for us. I don't have to say for those who know us, but for those who don't.. I was in a really abusive relationship with the father of my angel. It took me a very long time to realize this is not how I should be treated and stop giving second chances when I know the person won't change. It's that never ending cicle of these kind of relationships, you always hope it gets better, but it doesn't. Things got out of hands and I got pregnant. He insistead I will get an abortion and everyone around me supported this idea but I just couldn't do it because I was 100% sure that the little angel inside me deserves to be born and I couldn't take away his life once he decided to come here. He is the only reason that keeps me going through this life, that keeps my head up and keeps me fighting. It's all for him. After I got pregnant, it went hectic more, he abused me more and after some time he left me and never really cared for me or his wonderful son. During the pregnancy he barely called and if he did it was all really bad full of abusive words and threats on my person and my yet unborn son, it was a very difficult period for us to go through. But now that I think about it backwards, to this very day him leaving me and my son is still the best thing that could have happen to us, because I can't imagine what would we go through if he stayed and if I was even here right now. Then this angel was born.I was a single mother , going through life, living with my mother in one household also fighting for almost every single day. She is unemployed because she has problems with her hearing (she barely hears on her left ear) and she lives from benefits til this day so we can't really rely on any kind of support from her, my dad passed away, so did my partners mother last year and his father is in a bad financial situation since he is raising alone his daughter in the UK and has some things going on that we don't want to talk about here.We wanted first to move there since it would have been easier but he can't support us and doesn't have the place. It may sound unbelievable but this is our reality.So .. to continue the story months passed and I met the man of my life when he came back from outland (we were friends since childhood) and since then we are together and Sammy adores him and treats him like his own father and my partner treats him like his very own little boy . To get to the point, it's not easy for us here. I can't work because of Samuel for now, I wanted to get a tattoo certificate since creating art and drawing mean a lot to me, but with this little kiddo growing and still not getting to kindergarden because there is literally no place here we have it limited so he is passing another year) for now it's impossible. My partner is working but it's a nightmare and barely gets us anywhere, I have benefits on my child and when we add all the money the end game is that we live from day to day financially, we are trying as much as we can to dig ourselves out of this hole and still provide Sammy and ourselves a life worth living, but it's impossible to save up money and not live from day to day worrying or even get somewhere else like this. Everything here just makes us sick, it got to a point where I started to suffer from depression and anxiety and had to go to a hospital a few times and I don't want my child to see this and experience this. We need change. After months of talks, arguments, messages forth and back with some people from that one foreign country and decisions we finally decided that the best thing we can do is to move and start our life a new. Leave this here behind and secure our family a brighter future than awaits us here. I want what is best for my child mostly, then comes me and my partner. And that best is not here. So we decided to move to Scotland and after we settle get married there. This country gave us what it could and we have to go. It was our little dream for some time, and we talked to so many people on what, how and if it is right that we got so many positive responses that we just decided to go for it. The problem is the money, as it is always in this capitalist world. We can't save anything to go with, we can't take a loan if we are moving. So we decided to turn to people and to this website. We calculated all the things with some help and we have to pay for: plain tickets  rent for at least three months just to be secure and not worry about it until my partner finds a job, I find the perfect Steiner school for Sammy (since he needs special education and care) and find a job for myself. food  things we can't bring from home and will be needed (the movement of things is way too expensive through plane or any other form of transport) to buy a used car for the family  for the things that may come in the first monthsWe know it's a lot to ask for, but we have to take every chance we could get because we are really concerned here and we have to move. You know when you have that core feeling, this is that for us. Will be eternally grateful for even 1  . Every thing counts and brings us one step further to our new life. Thank you for all your support and shares. Truly from the bottom of our hearts we are very very grateful. Love and light.P.S. Since our country is not supported on GoFundMe we had to reach out for my partners dad to give us his informations and that is why we are able to do this.

But this would mean SO VERY MUCH to me because i could accomplish the needs of my son with no problem even be able to pull overtime hours at work to buy him much more things then i have been able to before, And if this fundraiser was to go succesfull I would be very thankful to all who helped, & would have no problem thanking them all one by one & offering my help to them in any way i can to the best of my abilities !

Hello everyone, my name is Ashley I am a single hard working mother trying to keep a roof over my son's head and raise him the best that I now how. My boyfriend and I split up and I need to come up with the rest of the money for the rent so I can stay in the apartment. I work from 9-5pm and a 3 year old in school because I can not stay at home with him because I depend on my job to pay for our bills, school and food. And I pay everything now on my own with no complaints. I know its touch right now but i do believe it will get better. I do all I can for my son. I've tried to find ways to make easy fast cash like surveys that pay but either I'm not doing it right or going to the wrong websites. My grandmother thought me be every independent and always work hard so that i never struggle. And my gosh I've always done so. I hate to ask for money im not the kind of person to ask. I rather starve myself. Never have until today because I'm in such a pickel. And I really can't believe I'm doing this and I'm kicking myself but I can't be stressing out the way that I am its not healthy. I have two weeks to come up with the money. I have some but not enough. I may not be asking for much but to me it is. I appreciate any and every penny donated to not me but my son. Because if it was just me I'd stay with the drama that im in or even a hole in the wall. But ever since I had my son 3 years ago my first priority has and always will be him. I'd do anything even this the last thing on this earth I'd ever want to do. Thank you so much. I am very greatful.

                        Grant and I have been praying about starting our family for over a year now. We knew that getting pregnant would be difficult due to certain medical issues. Time went by and we waited for our little blessing. After months and months of nothing we decided to take a day, relax, and go on a picnic. We drove up to a park on the top of hill that overlooks Laguna Beach. It was a beautiful day. We had talked about adopting before but never fully looked into it. We had always assumed we would adopt later in our life. Well, we sat down for our lunch and started talking. Later in that conversation we came to the conclusion that if it was God's will, we would adopt now. We prayed. God showed us different agencies and eventually led us to Nightlight Christian Agency.It took a lot of prayer for me and Grant to get to this decision and now that we are full on in this process we need as much prayer and support as we can get. Any prayer support you can offer would be a huge blessing to the two of us! We ask for prayer for guideance throughout the process and for peace with decisions that will have to be made. We also ask for prayer for our future birthmother and the difficult decision she is faced with. Lastly we ask for prayer for finances and God's provision with all the costs. Domestic adoption can cost us anywhere from $16,000-$40,000 or even more depending on the situation. We are hoping to raise as much as we can in preparation for our future baby. We'd like to thank you in advance for your donation and helping us in this adventure of ours!

We thank you for being part of a loving community to help mold our Sutch into
wonderful human being. Items needed are as follows:

I am a father to a 6 year old, I have been fighting for equality for the past 4+ years in courts and have exhausted all of my resources to continue to pay my attorney fees. I am hoping that this may help me.My attorney bills have consumed me over the past 4 years, I just need help.As a single father who has newly joint custody I make sure my little girl always speaks to her mother, morning, noon, day, and night. I encourage communication between mom and daughter, after all my bias cannot be controlled by my own emotions. I fought for now for almost 5 years to get to where I am at with my daughter. I have sold, so many of my personal belongings along with borrowing money to try my hardest to pay my legal fees. I do not receive anything close to civility in return, I receive minimum phone calls with ambient noise that can rival a small jet. I call my child every night to say goodnight; however, I am told my daughter is asleep. What does a parent have to do to just get equal treatment, yes the order states equality; however, who is overseeing if equality is being practiced?

Help Dan and Casey with IVF,"$10,265 ","$30,000 ",Family," April 11, 2016",160,5,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,1200,6,9,"

                        Thank you for visiting our gofundme site. This site has beencreated to help us with the expenses that are going to be coming from the IVF treatment we are starting at the end of this month. We were hoping to do all of this on our own, but we realized very quickly that we just can't.Dan and I have been trying to have a child for almost 4 years now. 4 miscarriages later, we are now going to try IVF. We have done lots of testing on ourselves, and our babies. Dan and I are both fine, and have no issues. Our babies (the last two miscarriages, as insurance doesn't cover testing the babies till you have had 3 losses) had extra chromosomes. The third baby had 3 extra, and the 4th had 4 extra. There is no real reason for why they had extra chromosomes, which can be really hard. If there was an issue, they could just fix it, and we would be good! We decided to visit a specialist to discuss our options at the end of March. We met with Doctor Batcheller at CCRM. Shewas very direct in telling us that IVF would be our best option. They will be able to do testing on the eggs that they fertilize, and make sure that they have the proper number of chromosomes. In my mind, completely eliminating the issue we have been having.Like I said, we will begin this journey at the end of April. ***please note I am not a doctor (what? right?!), so the next is just a dumb down version of what will happen.*** They will first do some tests, and a few procedures on me. These tests will help to decide what type/how much medication I will need, and also to make sure everything is structurally still good with me. Then in May I will start the medication. From what I hear it will be injections that I take, and it will help me to produce as many eggs as possible in my next cycle. Saying everything goes well, I believe that in June they would retrieve the eggs. That's when the magic really happens! They will fertilize my eggs, let them develop for a while, and then send some of the cells to their main clinic in Denver. They will look at the cells and determine which ones are viable. The doctor said that we should imagine that there will be 1 or 2 that will be viable...hopefully more, but better to think that way. At that point we will decide (if we have more than 1 egg) how many we will put in my uterus, and then we will hopefully have a successful pregnancy, and then a very cute, big headed baby! If we have extra fertilized eggs, they will be frozen.Your insanely generous donation (no matter how much) will go toward the cost of all the magic I described above. It's hard for us to ask for this help, as there is a chance it won't work. But like everything else in life, we don't know how things are going to go, and we just have to be positive and move forward.We will continue to keep everyone updated on my blog, caseyhaeg.blogspot.com.Thank you again for reading our story, and for being on this journey with us.Love,Casey and Dan (and WhatWhat the pug)

                                                            on behalf of Craig Rusin

SAN DIEGO, CA                                





                        William Gray Rusin was born 11lbs 14 ounces on July 18, 2016. Just 4 days after his birth, before he ever left the hospital, he lost his 31 year old mother to a rare but gruesome infection she caught during the delivery. Joy Rusin had only one day to enjoy holding her son, before her physical pain became so unbearable she couldn't even place him on her chest. This pain got progressively worse over the next four days until she died on Friday, July 22nd. What she caught was Necrotizing Fasciitis. When the doctors finally realized what she had, they rushed her into surgery to remove what they could of the infected tissue. After surgery, all her organs began shutting down. At least a dozen doctors worked frantically for the next 12 hours to keep her alive as she kept coding, until her heart finally couldn't hold on any longer. Joy was a bright light in the lives of many, radiating true love for the world and those around her. All of us who were blessed with Joy's love were forever transformed by the magic of her heart and her genuine unselfishness. Joy had been trying for years to have a baby, having multiple IUI's and finally IVF before getting pregnant. And just as she was experiencing her dreams of being a mother, she was taken from this world.Joy would reach her hand out to anyone in need. Now we are reaching out on her behalf. We realize the immense duty to carry on her life's purpose of love and service and to help her fulfill her dream of raising this beautiful baby boy. This is a tremendously emotional time. Our goal is to ease the financial burden as much as possible. Your gift, which will be managed by Joy's husband and William's father Craig Rusin, will be used to offset the high medical expenses incurred, support the needs of baby William, and offer a small sense of comfort in the wake of this tremendous loss.

                        I would like to introduce you to our sweet & dear friends, Brad and Tara...We met them while we were both in Ethiopia completing adoptions & became fast friends!They are an amazing couple, who loves the Lord and lives hands open to however He leads them...What started for them, as adopting one baby from Ethiopia, turned into God calling them back to adopt a sibling set as well, a 10y/o boy & his 2 y/o brother..0-3 kids (and, ahem, 3 sets of adoption expenses) in less then a year! Their hearts were once again drawn to not just caring for the fatherless but helping women in crisis pregnancies. And despite living off of just two teacher salaries...they pursued infant domestic adoption. They got their sweet boy Micah 18 months ago.They were not planing to adopt again, But God....They just received a call that their son's birthmama was pregnant again & wanted them to adopt this baby too! But she's due in less then 2 months..I prayed with my dear friend as they wrestled with this, they wanted to so badly say yes & couldn't fathom saying no! But financially, there was no way they could pay that much so fast...so that's where we come in!They've committed to adopt this baby & are hastily working to complete all the paperwork required. They need to raise $32,000 in the next 30 days...I know, it's a lot! But if everyone of my friends and hers, just donated $10, that would be close to $12,000! They are preparing to take out a loan for what they need to..Not everyone can adopt, but everyone can help a family do so..please consider donating, share this...a little bit by many, truly adds up!**many times in an adoption process, when talking about how much it costs & especially in fundraising, adoptive families are asked, ""why does it cost so much?"" and sometimes told, ""well if you cant afford it then you shouldn't adopt""..to the 2nd I tell people, if they had had a biological child who was born prematurely and in the NICU for months, they would have to fundraise to cover all those medial bills, they wouldnt say ""sorry, we can't afford this"". And to the first question, please know that none of this money goes to the birthmom & the agency they are using is a non-profit. Adoption monies go to pay all of the office staff salaries, the social worker's -who spend countelss hours with these birthmama's-salary, paperwork to make sure families are safe..the list goes on and on...**

TITUSVILLE, NJ                                





                        The Herrington-Volaric Family is an incredible family with an incredible story. Its a story filled with uncompromising commitment to love, family and children in need. All three of the Herrington-Volaric kids were adopted from the foster system, and they are now preparing to welcome two additional children  the siblings of two of their adopted children  into their family. However, their current home doesnt have the room for two more children, and they now plan to buy and renovate a fixer-upper housein hopes of giving these two children the loving and supportive home they need. Any and all support that you can give towards helping them achieve this goal would be greatly appreciated. Continue reading to hear their amazing story, written by Sandee, the courageous mom whose dedication to these children has never wavered:***********************************************************In 1999, when my husband Steve and I met and fell in love, we didn't think we wanted children. By the time we got married in 2003, we were a bit less certain and started thinking about fostering and adoption. In 2005 we moved to New Jersey for work and started seriously thinking about starting a family and fostering to adopt. Because we wanted to give any future children a sense of stability and security, we first chose to buy a home. We bought a modest starter home, and due to a variety of factors, its still the home we live in now. In 2006 we became a licensed resource (foster) home and started short-term fostering, but we quickly realized we were too sensitive to do short-term placements because it was too painful to say goodbye. We decided that-long term fostering was our real calling so that we could make foster children a permanent part of our family.Our oldest son Gabe was placed with us in 2007 at 10 months old, and he was perfect. We fell in love with him immediately, as did our family and friends, but we waited what seemed like an eternity to be able to adopt him. While we were navigating the system and waiting to adopt Gabe (which we finally did in 2010), we still entertained the idea of perhaps having biological children as well. That thought disappeared the moment our daughter Sondra was placed with us. Sondra was 5 weeks old when she was placed with us in 2010, and she instantly stole our hearts. Incredibly, Sondra was the birth sibling of our first two foster children, and we thought it a clear indicator she was meant to be a part of our forever family. Sondras adoption was completed in 2011, and we were over the moon with joy. We couldn't believe how incredibly lucky we were to have two such wonderful children in our little family and in our lives. We thought our family was complete.At the end of 2012, we got a call about a 2-day old baby boy who was amazingly the biological sibling of Sondra and in need of a family. We worried about whether we could handle 3 kids and give them everything they need and deserve. However, we knew it was the right thing to do, and within two wild hours, our family of 4 suddenly became a family of 5 as we welcomed our son, Lovie, into our home and family. We officially adopted Lovie in 2013. With three adoptions finalized, our modest 3-bedroom house is definitely full and our family feels complete.When people ask us what if questions about whether we would take more kids, we joke that we would take in many more if we had the financial means. We took ourselves off the foster list due to the space in our house, but we knew we might get calls about other siblings. That seemed a far-off possibility, but we knew we'd make that choice if it was warranted. In mid-July, we got a call about Sondra and Lovies two half-siblings. They have been split apart from each other; one in a short-term foster home and one in a facility. L, a girl is 9 and S, a boy is 8. We already knew of them because we got calls about them when they were babies. They weren't placed with us, though, because their biological father was found, and they were placed with him. We thought they were living happily ever after with their birth father, but sadly that has not been the case. Proceedings have started to terminate their relationship to their father, and they may need placement very soon.Their lives have not been easy. They need a home, and they need a permanent family.We would like to be that family. We have the space in our hearts, but we don't have the space in our home. Our home does not meet the minimum state licensing requirements for two more children. We need a bigger house if we have any hopes of bringing home L & S, and renovating our current house proved to be extremely cost-prohibitive. Because we are committed to these children, we are currently buying a fixer-upper in our current town and have plans to renovate it so the whole family will be comfortable and happy. We are uncomfortable asking for help, but we know what the future likely holds for L & S if we can't take them. The state has run out of kinship resources and their current foster homes are not interested in adopting them. They have expressed that their one desire is to be together. People aren't exactly lining up to adopt older children, let alone a sibling group. We fear they will bounce from placement to placement and eventually age out of the foster care system, left to navigate this world on their own. We want them to be able to live in our happy forever family  together  with their two half-siblings, a brother their age, a loving mom and dad, and a welcoming family and friend network eager to embrace them and work through any challenges.A move plus a renovation (not to mention renting our current house) will be a challenge, but nothing is more important than providing these two children with stability, love, and certainty. Please help us give these kids what so many of us have never had to consider living without. Whatever help you can offer would be much appreciated by all of us. Their lives matter, and with your help, their future is bright and full of hope.""***********************************************************Sondra, Lovie and Gabe - July 2016From left to right: Gabe, Steve, Lovie, Sandee and Sondra, July 2016Steve and Sandee, July 2016

IVF for a baby Avery,$715 ,"$15,000 ",Family," July 13, 2016",15,2,HUNTSVILLE,AL,309000,,1,"

HUNTSVILLE, AL                                




This is the story of Roger & Jessi AveryWe are starting this Go Fund Me account to help pay for IVF. Our story begins in 2008 when we got married. Everything was wonderful as newlyweds. We both worked full time and had just bought our first house together. We didn't jump right into starting a family because we wanted to enjoy each other. At the time our brothers & sisters had just begun having kids. We had the best of both worlds, nieces and nephews to hold, to love and to play with, get them all sugared up and send right back to their parents as soon as they started acting up. It was awesome!! But something was missing. At the end of the day after all the birthday parties, the play dates and sleepovers there was emptiness inside us. For the most part we were very happy but nothing we did was fulfilling the emptiness we had. So we began the talks and the what-ifs about starting our own family. That's where the fairy tale kind of came to a halt.After many years of trying the good old fashion way and letting the good lord decide when we would have a child, we decided to go see an OB/GYN to see why we are not becoming pregnant. This is when we learned that we had technical difficulty. Being true Avery's, who cannot do anything simple, easy or in moderation, we learned that we had not one problem but a multitude of problems, Endometriosis, Adenomyosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, just to name a few. We had surgery after surgery to try to remove cyst & endometriosis, and to do all kinds of tests. Eventually they found a mass on one of the ovaries. They tried to save the ovary during the removal of the borderline tumor but the tumor had taken over the ovary and there wasnt any hope of saving it. After that we were led to believe that we should be on the fast track to a having a child. But like before, no luck. This is when we decided to seek out the fertility doctors. After meeting with the specialist we were skeptically excited, the thought of having a child of our own seemed to be closer now than ever before. So we decided to try the Low Tech, cheaper way first, artificial insemination. For those of you out there you know that even the cheap way is not cheap when it comes to these kind of procedures and for those that don't, insurance does not cover any of this procedure so everything is out of pocket. After a couple of rounds of this procedure, with our fingers crossed, we ended up with nothing but disappointment and heartache. We meet back with the specialist, only to find out that with one ovary and one blocked tube (not on the same side, mind you) the only option left is the most expensive procedure out there, IVF. So this is why we are here reaching out to all our friends, family and good warmhearted people out there. We are not rich by any means. We both work very hard for what we have. But we cannot afford this procedures without help. So if you have any spare means available it would be more than greatly appreciated, it would be a blessing to us. Thank you for reading our story and God bless.With Love & Much Appreciation- Roger & Jessi Avery

                        Hi, my name is Waseem Syed and this campaign was made for our good friends the Jumshaid family. Unfortunately, On June 25, 2016, Jumshaid had went into a coma, and since then he hasn't woken up. Since he was a heart patient doctors assumed he was having heart problems, but in reality he was suffering from two strokes. When the doctors realized he was having a stroke it was too late. The damage had been done. Now the doctors say they can't do anything because he's bleeding in the brain, and if they give him medications to stop the bleeding his heart could be damaged. There's little they can do and now he's there fighting for his life.He's a taxi driver and was the only type of support for his family. His wife needs your help, as they have one son that's 2 years old and one child on the way. She has no source of income besides her husband who is in critical condition. She has so much hope that one day her husband will wake up and live his life like he used to. The money will be used to create a better future for his wife and kids. They don't have anything without him and they're depending on other people for help.We'd appreciate it very much if you would help us even if it is a little. The money will ne used for a great cause, which will not only be used to create a better life for him, but also abright future for his kids and wife.Jumshaid is a wonderful person who always brought joy and laughterto others. One of his biggest characteristics is when he would talks to someone, he would talk to them as if they're a long time friend. He would open his arms for everyone. Now we're hoping you could open your arms for him.Jumshaid was being held in Presence Resurrection Nursing & Rehab, but as of August 2, 2016 he was sent back to the hospital because his condition was getting worse. The hospital he is being held at is St. Francis Hospital in Evanston Illinois. We really do appreciate your help, and please keep him in your prayers.

                        ""...Whoever welcomes one child like this in My name, welcomes Me"" -Matthew 18:5Adoption has always been in our hearts. One of the first questions Ashlee asked me when we started dating was, ""would you be willing to adopt?"" And I said, ""of course!"" It was a no-brainer. We feel an unbelievable passion and drive to adopt. There are so many children in the world who need a loving home and there are so many mothers out there who just need the love of someone who truly cares about them. That's where we come in. You may be asking yourself, ""but why not just have a child of your own?"" We would just smile and say to you that we beleive we are called to create a loving, safe environment for a child that is meant for us, but created in another.That said, we have started the process alongside Bethany Christian Services, an amazing group who have not only the baby's best interest in mind, but they also have such devotion to the Birth Mothers and that has become very important to us. Birth Mothers are not evil, they are making the most loving choice that they can by carrying a child for 9 months and choosing to give their child the best chance for a bright future. We eagerly jumped on board with Bethany after hearing their devotion to these mothers. We were able to meet a few of the mothers and thier stories are so filled with God's grace and love that it is imposible to listen without tears. This will be a Rollercoaster of a journey with endless paperwork, home studies, more paperwork, training sessions, some more paperwork, building a profile book, getting the nursery ready, praying, waiting, and did I mention paperwork?? It will also be an expensive endeavor. One that we will not be able to make alone. With much encouragement from our friends and family we have decide to create this gofundme account and ask for any assistance you are willing to give, even if it's just a dollar and a prayer. We plan on raising a shining light in this world and we would love for you to stand beside us. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts-Ashlee & Brandon...And may the force be with you!

After years of praying and longing for a family, the Lord has led us to pursue the domestic newborn adoption of Zachary Tyler Dix <3While our journey up to this point has been a long and painful one in many ways, we also see that God is in the process of healing and redeeming so much of our pain and grief. We are beginning to see that just because our prayers have not been answered for a family in the way we originally hoped, adoption was his plan for us all along. We were blessed July 18th to find out that we could possibly be adopting a baby boy and it was confirmed on July 22nd. Zach's due date is October 31, 2016!This adoption is not just about us, but also a very brave birth mom, and the lives and stories of so many others. We are excited as we step out in faith and embark in this journey.There are many steps that have to be taken in an adoption. We are thankful to already be matched with a birth mother but there are many other steps to be taken and one of the biggest is funding. We were blessed to be able to cover the upfront adoption fees on such short notice but there are many other fees associated with the adoption such as attorney fees, court cost, filing fees, the homestudy, and gaurdian ad litem which is in the best interest of the child. The thought of fundraising is overwhelming but we have been encouraged by our sweet friends and family to set up this GoFundMe account. The hope is that this will make giving easy for those who have expressed a desire to support us in this process.It is with the support and strength of our loving friends and family that we boldly take this step into our adoption journey! <3With love,Curtis & Tabitha

                        Aloha! I am a stay at home Mother of two beautiful boys, and we live on the Big Island of Hawaii. On July 27, my ex-husband failed to return our children after their summer visitation with him on the Mainland. Instead of putting them on the plane, he filed false claims with the court (in addition to the false accusations he filed with DHS earlier in the month - which were determinedto be unfounded by their representitive) and received temporary emergency custody. I only discovered this, after calling the airline to checkthat they didn't miss their flight prior to me boarding my flight from the Big Island to Oahu to go pick them up. I was informed by the airlines that their tickets had been cancelled the week prior. It was several hours of panic and worry, before I was finally able to get ahold of my ex-husband and find out where the boys were. This is when he informed me that he ""had a piece of paper from the judge saying he could keep the boys"" and that I should talk to my lawyer if I wanted to know more.Now I had talked with the boys the Thursday prior, and they were excited about coming home and school starting (we homeschool them through a charter school). I also spoke to their uncle (their father was either not there or unwilling to talk with mewhen I asked to speak with him or his new wife) about their flight the following Monday. At no time during this phone conversation, nor any other time prior to this, was anything said about the boys not flying home as scheduled.Since coming to the Mainland, I have only been allowed to see the boys every other weekend. During which, I have observed that they are depressed (even noted by their attorney) as well as clingy. My youngest son has even been having nightmares, which he describes as""I'll never get to see you again."" One of the boys even had the following idea: ""If I had a magic potion, I could turn into a grown up and tell the judge that you are a good Mommy and we want to go home with you. Then I could drink another magic potion and turn back into a kid when we get back home to Hawaii.""My current husband and Ihave had to spend every penny we had, as well as borrow large sums from family members, just to hire a lawyer to represent us. As well as hiring a lawyer to represent the boy's interest. I am fundraising to cover the travel and lodging expenses of flying witnesses from Hawaii to the Mainland for our upcoming trial. In addition to this, part of the monies raised will also go to paying for our travel back to Hawaii, once I get back custody of the boys. Our boys mean everything to us, and we just want to get them back to our loving home in Hawaii.It would mean so much to all of us, if you could help us in our efforts toreunite our family. Thank you!

Return Baby Evelyn,"$1,700 ","$5,000 ",Family," September 18, 2016",9,7,LYNDEN,WA,214000,2,1,"

                        This fund raising is for my dear sister Anastasia to help us return her 3 year 8 months old daughter (my little  niece) Evelyn. Evelyn is the oldest of three children; she has a 2 year 5 months old sister Alyssa and 15 months old baby brother, Jimmy. My sister was in abusive relationship that steadily escalated in the past year. Her husband would move them around the country every few months, preventing Anastasia from working a good paying job shortly after she would find one. She has been a bread winner for her family for many years. However, during the past year her husband became increasingly controling to the point of not allowing her to go to work, even though he didn't work enough to even pay the bills. Trying to get away from constant physical and emotional abuse.  She was hiding out at her friends house far away from home while our parents were on their way driving from Washington to Missouri. Her husband found out where she was staying; he ran into the house grabbed their oldest daughter Evelyn and ran off with her.  Anastasia has been going through legal process to get full custody of her 3 children. She is heart broken; her second daughter Alyssa, also, is missing her sister terribly. Police and cps so far were not able to locate Evelyn. Going back and forth from WA to MO on top of legal fees, puts difficult emotional and financial burden on the whole family. If you have the desire in your heart to help, it is desperately needed and would be greatly appreciated.

                        My adoption journey has begun. I have always wanted to be a mother- - dreamt of it as a child- even before I knew where babies came from. Following the medical necessity for and grief of having a hysterectomy, Ive had to accept that motherhood will not come to me the natural way. But when one door closes, God always opens another. The Lord has placed on my heart and spirit to adopt a child. Most people really are not aware of the financial challenges facing persons seeking to adopt a child. Thousands of dollars are needed well before the child is brought home. The need for these initial funds can stop the adoption journey for many before it gets a chance to start. So, in addition to fundraising events, I am setting up this page to ask for your help. We all know the proverb, It takes a village to raise a child. I am seeking help from the village to help me give a child a loving, safe, forever home. With your help, I will be able to hold that baby in my arms and give him or her all the love given to me as a child and all the love that overwhelms my heart.Thank you for taking the time to read my page. First and foremost, I ask for your prayers, but I also ask that your heart will lead you to make a donation. Any and every amount will bring me one step closer to being Mommy!God Bless You and Thank You!!Yolandra (Shelly)

Baby Killian, Mom Laura, and Grandma Deb have to move very soon as where we have been living is being sold shortly. It's happening a lot to people these days. 


Steven, our uncle, brother and son, and his wife Mackenzie have searched, found and bought a mobile home. They are willing to take very small payments from us and once we pay them back it is ours completely and we won't be kicked out again! I can never tell you how much we appreciate their reaching out to us and for us this way. Never. But here's where we need you our community, our village, to help us. It has to be remodeled before anyone can live in it. 


It's an older 1980's single wide with 3 bedrooms and it needs the roof replaced, sub flooring and flooring replaced, carpet replaced, plumbing and fixtures mended and replaced, windows replaced, heater and water heater possibly replaced and the entire place deep cleaned and painted. A maximum fixer upper but, it will be ours when it is done and a safe, healthy and stable environment for all of us. 


But we need your help to make it all happen. While we can do the cleaning and help with some of the work most of this has to be done by professionals and with labor, and materials we are looking at $10,000.00 worth of repair costs. We don't have that nor can we get it. 


So, we are doing something we never thought we would do and asking for your help. Every $1.00, $5.00 or $10.00 will go towards making this a real dream come true. It will all go towards fixing this up as quickly as possible so that we can move in and stop hanging in limbo, move forward with our lives, watch Killian grow even more and never be kicked out again! 


We need to move quickly on this as a roof needs to be on before it gets too rainy again and we are shooting at being in before the holidays hit and Winter is on us, so we are setting this for 30 days. 


Please don't think that a dollar is too little because every single dollar will count and help! Anything you can give is appreciated beyond words. 


Thank you! Bless you! 


Killian, Laura and Deb.

Bouncing Baby Brogan,"$10,685 ","$30,000 ",Family," September 5, 2016",23,20,KIRKLAND,WA,210000,2,3,"






                            Kelly Anne Brogan
                            
                            
                                                           
KIRKLAND, WA                                




Dear Family and Friends,This has been an incredibly eventful summer for us Brogans. Itwas alsorather difficult in our little Brogan family. At the beginning of the summer, we started to investigate why we were experiencing difficulty with expanding our family. We found out that, according to the doctors, due to various factors they actually do not anticipate we are able to have children on our own. The chances, according to science, are incredibly slim. BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE!!!We have started the process to look into what the right way to start our family is for us. The wonderful specialists are on our team believe that the high tech IVF option is likely our only chance to have children of our own. We were understandably surprised, and caught a little off guard, by these circumstances. But we are no strangers to working hard for our families, or for planning ahead.That being said, we are starting into a season of a lot of unplanned expenses, medications, and uncertainty. We are full of HOPE, FAITH and incredible EXPECTATION. While we have been sad, and confused with the start of this process, we also know that it is just that- the start.As we first started investigating what we were dealing with, God kept reminding us that He is good, that his plans for us are Good. But regardless of how we thought this process would look, we have never been this way before. And God goes ahead of us.Entering into this process, we are aware the insurance covers exactly 0% of everything. This is likely our main obstacle. We are going to start an aggressive season of believing for several miracles! We are going to be launching several campaigns to try to raise funds. All costs are due at the time of service for IVF, meaning that we have to have the money before we can begin any treatments. We will be shamelessly accepting donations viathisGOFUNDME.COMcampaign, as well as starting anEtsy.comshop in order to sell items for the purposes of raising funds for IVF treatment and bringing home a baby.More information to come as soon as the shop is set up!!! Once it is, please feel free to check it out, and share it with people who could really benefit from it!We understand that this process is not one that we are able to pursue on our own- we need a family, a village and possibly a whole ton of everyone else possible to help us get where we want to go. For that reason, we would humbly ask a few things of all of you.First and foremost, that you keep us in your prayers.We so appreciate prayers, good thoughts,love...Second, that you believe with us! Encourage us when we need it, understand that we feel excited and hopeful, and vulnerable and tender.Third, please help us spread the word. Help us gain more exposure to people who may want to donate or buy things to help us out. People may even be in the same situation as us! As we have started out on this journey we have been completely floored by the couples and friends who have found themselves in such a similar situation. Our hearts go out to them! But maybe by raising awareness, and giving them a chance to participate in our community, possibly we may also be making way for a miracle in their own lives.Gods plan and purpose for this Brogan family is only beginning. The bump on the road, regardless of how big or substantial it feels, is really only that- a bump on a road. And God already has our entire journey mapped out, beginning to end, and this particular part of the journey has come as no surprise to Him! He knows the ins and outs of our journey, the timing and the purposes that He laid out for us. He has never let us down or disappointed, so we are confident in who God is. He is our healer, He is our champion, He is our hope.Thank you so much for being a part of our lives. Thank you ahead of time for your care and support.Love,Kelly and Jim BroganP.S. If you have questions, about donating, the process, or even if you would prefer to ask me about other ways to donate, please send us an email or a facebook message!

                        On May 23rd 2015 Trevor and Kayla got married. They both knew that they wanted to start a family right away. Up until now the struggle to do that has been silent. With there permission I wanted to share there story.Kayla suffered a miscarriage at 6 weeks and has since gone through month after month of heartache. They were eventually recommended to a infertility clinic where they focused on testing but could not come up with a reason why they could not get pregnant. They both are healthy and young and were than diangosed with unexplained infertility. They finally decided to do an iui (Interuterine insemination) to increase there chances. The procedure ended in a chemical pregnancy and led to more heartache for them. After visiting another clinic, they were put through more testing..some very invasive and painful for Kayla. They finally ended up in Michigan at there third and final clinic. Trevor and Kayla were told that the best option they had was to move forward with an IVF procedure becuause they had exhaused all of there other options. They saved and saved there money and unfortunately the procedure did not take. Trevor and Kayla have spent over $20,000 to achieve their dream. During the IVF cycle 8 eggs were produced, unfornately none of them were able to turn into a pregnancy. They were told at the follow up appointment after the IVF that the option of conceiving on there own are slim to none. They also were presented with the devastaing news that Kayla has decreased ovarian function and will more than likely not make any eggs after the age of 30. The options they have are to use a donor egg or try another IVF with pre implantion screening and diffrent medication to try to boost the number of eggs Kayla will make. After over a year of searching for an answer they have finally found out the reason why they cant get pregnant.Now they need the help of there friends and family to make it possible to achieve there dream of becoming parents. The next procedure will be about $30,000and insurance does not cover any of the procedure so the cost is all out of pocket. Please find it in your heart to donate or share this post to help these amazing people become parents. They deserve it!!

Young man with Down Syndrome needs:,$273 ,"$1,500 ",Family," May 30, 2016",17,3,COOKEVILLE,TN,239000,8,2,"






                            Charlette Ruff Mertes
                            
                                                            on behalf of Nathan Mertes

COOKEVILLE, TN                                





                        Hello everyone. My name is Charlette, I am 53 and have a 22 year old son with Down Syndrome, named Nathan. The photo is us of course. I was trying to give him bunny ears like he always gives me, so he was trying to grab my hand. lol His life is mostly in the house on his computer or playing with his many masks and plush characters. He loves to joke with and entertain people. He was pretty much always the class clown in school, and some things he got chastised for, he learned from me. :) Who knew that you can't moon people in school lol (no, I didn't teach him that one lol).There is an Amazon wishlist link at the end of this, if you don't feel like reading this all the way through, and don't want to donate here. Well anyway, he discovered youtube years ago so my daughter made him an account and named it Nathanofadown after the System of a Down group that he really loved at the time. Then one day I got the idea to post a video of him on his account. He loved it, and then wanted more and more videos, so I decided to share his funny happy self with the world. Then I also made a facebook Nathanofadown that is family friendly and gets more personal, and a facebook Nathanofadown Uncensored for when he is showing what he's learned from youtube and explicit lyric songs. lol We are a one, low income family because I will not put my child that can barely communicate in a strangers care so that I can go to work. I've always made ends meet though, and Nathan is very spoiled. I know how to live poor with no problem, but when I was talking with someone (a famous youtuber called AskaGangsta) recently about not being able to work because I stay home with him, and wishing that I could move us out of my house with poisonous brown recluse spiders, he suggested that I make a gofundme account and then he will share it. While I can't see doing this for a move (since it could take forever to find the right place that would be safe for Nathan and cheap enough to pay monthly), I thought of other ways that people who want to could help Nathan and then also made the wishlist. AskaGangsta said that he would purchase something on the Wishlist so that we could make a video of what he got from him. <3He currently has an old 300 gb with 3 ram computer which is now full with videos and lags when he watches youtube. He likes to have the videos that we make on his computer to watch, so I have been having to load the videos to my computer in order to put them through movie maker to downsize them and edit them to put on his computer and youtube. My computer is now full and has become a confusing mess of videos that I don't know if I gave him or not, which has overwhelmed me to the point of not wanting him to do videos anymore. I've been looking at computers on Amazon and would really like to get him one of the 2 TB ones to hold many many videos for years to come. While I was trying to decide on a computer to get him, we ended up using our many years of savings to buy a car for me and him, since our 1990 van has had no heat, air, or cd player for years now and the steering was going out.Besides the computer, other things that he could use.....his 14 megapixel camera broke, so he and I have been using an old 7 megapixel camera that doesn't always take very clear pictures or videos. He could use a good one for the many videos that he and I make for his youtube and facebook.He also could use a treadmill and/or an exercise bike. He has had some health problems the past couple years, like gout and bad sores under his belly. I changed his diet and started giving him many supplements. His weight has gone done from 185 last year, to 166 now. I had started to get him to exercise with what we have, but I really think a treadmill for him to walk on or an exercise bike would be best for him. We live on a busy street with no sidewalk, so we can't take walks. I took him to the park thinking we could walk there, and go figure, he just wanted to swing. I'm sure he thought that was exercise...he thinks playing video games is exercise. lolI never thought about getting donations for him before, but it sure would take some stress off of me, and make his life more enjoyable. And actually help me to get back to posting videos to help others enjoy him too, butI don't like people to do things for us that can't afford it. So please do not give if you are having a hard time making ends meet yourself.... you can help by sharing this. But hey, if you're very rich, we could use a house also. lol ;)Any money received beyond the price of the items will be used for Nathan's many interests. He loves watching SML (Super Mario Logan) on youtube and wants all the plush characters, and even doubles. So, he already has a bunch of Mario plush and a Chef Pee pee (which he has done a couple videos with. Chef Pee Pee went to the dr. with him and got checked out. lol). He also loves the FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy's) youtube videos, so he asked for and got 4 of the plush and a very expensive Freddy mask. He has 2 tubs full of various masks that he occasionally does a video with. I am a very open down to earth person who is very public, so you can check us out on Nathanofadown facebook or youtube, and on my personal facebook. I am also running a facebook page called Down to Earth with Love, but when I got burned out with all Nathan's video stuff, I also temporarily stopped doing that page. My goal in life is to show people love and acceptance, and hopefully to make their day a little brighter. Many people say that Nathan does that for them, which usually helps me to keep going with his page and videos.Feel free to make comments or post links to deals on camera's and stuff that Nathan can use. I'm not sure how this works yet as far as people posting comments, but there will probably be some bad ones. I will delete them if I am able, but if not, I choose to handle people with love, not anger...for hate can't drive out hate, only love can do that. <3Now that I've written a book to you all lol, I'll say thank you to whoever donates. I will truly appreciate any help you all give, but remember, don't give to us if you really can't afford it, but do share for others to see. :) Here are the links to Nathan's pages, and the one that is mine. Go ahead and follow or subscribe to his youtube. :) And I am adding an Amazon wish list with some of the items and everything that was in my saved cart that was for him, but I still have to search for more. https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/26IZLVKUDNQAB/ref=cm_wl_huc_view https://www.youtube.com/c/nathanofadown https://www.facebook.com/Nathanofadown https://www.facebook.com/NathanofadownUncensored/ https://www.facebook.com/Downtoearthwithlove/

                        Dear Family and Friends,The Schwegmans are ready to have a family! As many of you know, we have gone through a lot of medical testing to try to figure out why we have been unable to get pregnant. We have no answers. Unexplained infertility. Pretty frustrating because there's nothing to do to treat ""unexplained"" except keep trying.And so, after 8 years, we both have the desire to adopt a baby. We have met with an agency and have turned in our application to get the process started. We're excited and really just want the process to move!Although we obviously don't know everything about it, we can imagine ourselves as parents. We look forward to making a life for a little boy or girl - playing catch or playing dress up, going to soccer games or dance recitals, family vacations and birthday parties, etc.The costs for adoption can vary. We will likely be looking upwards of $15,000. We have some in our savings to put into this, but cannot cover all of the costs.Would you please consider helping us make our dream of adopting a baby come true? Every donation counts!Thank you for taking the time to read this!Rick & Amber Schwegman

                        Hello Everyone,Wanda and I have been blessed with an opportunity to adopt an innocent baby (we don't know the sex), who would be put in the system were it not for someone reaching out to us.Our good friend reached out to me and told me a story of a young mother who is currently 6 months pregnant. This will be her 6th child and she knows that she can't handle it. Her original plan was to just leave the baby at the hospital and hope for the best. Thank God she thought to reach out to me about this. I quickly said yes. Wanda and I have discussed adoption and already had a name picked out. However, given that the baby is due in December and there is paperwork to be handled and preparations that need to be made to bring baby home, we have very little time to financially prepare for the new arrival.So...WE NEED YOUR HELP! Help us bring baby Micah Day Johnson (a unisex name) home! Donate as much as is comfortable for you. We are also open to physical gifts. We do not need a crib, rocking chair, or changing table. We have a good friend who is holding on to those for us. But we need EVERYTHING else or the money to get it all! SO PLEASE HELP!!!

Ray and family are in need of assitance to get started in a new location. Ray and Spring had a friend offer the use of a home that is currently for sale. I figured if we all chip in we can help them set up utilities for the home. They have use of it until the home sales. I know they will appreciate any assistance we can give them to move their personal belongings, set up utilities and other basic needs while Ray persues job opportunities.

Desperate to start a family ,$395 ,"$20,000 ",Family," March 1, 2016",8,6,RIALTO,CA,223000,,11,"

RIALTO, CA                                




First of all we are The Miranda's(Joseph and Nicole), now let me tell you why you are reading this. As long as I can remember there were only two things in life I wanted. The first was to be a good wife and the second was to be a momma. Unfortunately I have experienced two ectopic pregnancies which turn out as miscarriages and have been told I can't have kids naturally, my tubes are bad. This has been so devastating to say the least. It's so heartbreaking to see my siblings all have children and I don't. Everyone that knows me knows how much I love children, my dad just recently told me as I was crying one evening to him about not being able to have children that he feels so sad for me because out of all his kids he knew I was meant to be a momma and he feels terrible about the struggle I've had. So here we are in go fund me, I have never asked for handouts but I d esperately need help. At this point I am 39 and have seen a fertility specialist because of my age and other health issues. The costs are so high and I am so desperate to have children, we desperately need financial help so if you find it in your heart to help we would greatly appreciate any help you can give to get started. The money raised would help with the following things: Sonohysterogram/mock embryo transfer, monitoring ultrasounds and labs, egg retrieval, micro fertilization, anesthesia, cryopreservation and PGS as well as fertility medications. I can't put into words how grateful Joseph and I would be for any help we can get financially. My husband served in Afghanistan and Iraq and all I want is just to start a family together and start spending a happy life with a baby. At this point we have a plan set up with a wonderful Dr and his awesome staff......we can't wait to begin this journey, we have been together now almost nine years and we are so anxious to add to our family.

TEMPE, AZ                                





                        Just a few days ago my Grandfather Francis passed away at the young age of 90. He was shy of his 91st birthday by just 6 days. He was a Navy Veteran and a very proud Irishman. He had twelve kids and loved them all very dearly. One in paticular was also his best friend.  His name is Teddy. Uncle Teddy is the youngest of the twelve and has Down Syndrome. Teddy and Grandpap were inseperable for the last 46 years until just recently.  When Francis died, his Social Security checks and VA checks were, of course stopped. This helped Francis and Teddy pay the bills on the house like utilities, food and maintenance. Teddy is provided social security, but it's not enough to run the house which has been in the family for almost 70 years. Teddy has now lost more than 2/3rds of his income and needs our help.Teddys brothers and sisters are now his main care providers and have graciously been there to help him any way they can. Teddy is pretty much self sufficient, he can make a really good spaghetti and loves hanging out and watching the Pittsburgh Penguins win. Teddy unfortunately cannot work for a living, so he has always relied on the asssistance of family and social security.  Every little bit of financial help from all of us will go a long way to help Teddy stay fed, entertained, healthy and to keep him in the family home he grew up in.  Teddy and the rest of the family thank you for your support!Special Thanks to:Cindy, Gerry, Danny, Mary, Jake, Colleen and Mick for all your hard work and everything you have done for Teddy.

Hello we are trying to get donations to purchase a cheap reliable vehicle, so that we can get our daughter Charlie to the pediatric cardiologist and hospital she needs to go to to get heart repair surgery. There is no hospital closer to home that can provide the care she will need. Drs think everything will be ok but we are still worried and the stress of finding transportation and maybe missing an appt or surgery is so scary. We have utilized public transportation options for all her prenatal appointments, but we can't put her on public transportation because the risk of illness can be so high and potentially life threatening for an infant of her needs. We do not have enough friends and family that can take days out of their week to help with this. Please help us give our daughter a fighting chance.

                        As many of you know I was married for 9 years to an alcoholic who at the end of our marriage threatened to kill me. Unfortunately, I had to make the harrowing decision to leave him & fly free on my own path. I had to cash out a 401k to even hire an attorney because I had no other money.He controlled me w/ money. I was not allowed to work for 9 years, leaving me w/ no job experience. Nobody would hire me & I applied everywhere for every kind of job you can imagine. Years ago I was a hairstylist in MO so I decided to apply for my Florida cosmetology license & had to start working at a salon as an assistant for $8.50 an hour. This past December after only 4 months doing shit work, I worked my way up to a stylist. Great for my career but not for my bank account. As a stylist I work on commission only & I'm starting out w/ no clientele. So you can imagine what my paychecks looks like. The divorce was finalized & I was granted alimony for 3 years while I get on my feet & build my career. My ex husband was to refinance his vehicle in his own name, make payments for all the legal fees, pay any state & federal taxes owed, & remove me from his home loan. He continuously promises to pay the amount owed & then does not after making me beg for it for days at a time. He refuses to pay me & tells me to go work at Wal-mart. As of today he owes me over $3000 in back alimony + retainer fees for having to hire my attorney again. I spent every single penny I had in my account to pay the retainer fee for my lawyer 2 days ago.He believes he is above the law. He knows that the alimony is 95% of my income currently & continues to withhold it out of spite. He has not done 1 thing in our final signed agreement. I'm having to take him back to court to get what is rightfully mine & I need help for my legal fees. He is in contempt of court on all points & I'd been trying to do all the filing on my own but have had no luck. He's ruining my credit by not making payments on the loans my name is on & letting them go to default. We have filed Contempt of Court Charges against him & my attorney is asking for the earliest court date.If you know me, you know I refuse to borrow money or ask for help ever but I need help & so I'm asking for it. If you can't donate I understand that too but at least you know what's going on every time I go to the courthouse.

                        Being there since the start through the pregnancy as well as my sons birth (Prince-Jamal Jr.) was a truly treasured memory I hold close to my heart. Holding him for the first time, watching him learn new life skills made me so proud.Knowing I wanted better for both of us (his mother and I split shortly after he was born) I joined the US Navy. I was stationed in Virginia Beach, VA and was quickly shut out of my sons life. I have been doing all I can on my own ever since to find my son and be a part of his life but to no avail. Every time I find a way to contact his mother or her family she/they vanish in a matter of days. She as well as her family have blocked all attempts at contacting them via phone, text, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus and emails. Not only from my accounts and phone numbers but my wifes as well. I then learn that my sons mother hasn't lived with my son since at least 2009. I have filed several police reports and have had them do wellness checks only to be told all addresses are not where he is or has ever been. Then I am told they could be of no further assistance because the child was not in danger. (Not even knowing the wellbeing to start with)Once I started getting my regular checks (2 months after joining the military) I started sendingchild support on my own via western union, and attempting to start a legal and documented child support case. I then learned that a case had been opened behind my back and that even though his mother and I were in contact, she claimed to have no knowledge of my whereaboutsor how to reach me. After contacting Clark County Child Support caseworkers where the case was originally opened I was told that she was avoiding completing all paperwork and I couldnt do anything till the mother contacted the county back. All while the paperwork was being held un-finalized, I was being charged back child support. After months of run around with her it was finally finalized and an order was in place. Any contact with my son during all of this was solely based on whetheror not his mother receivedmoney from me. If she felt like it was enough and how long I was allowed to talk to him. Even after receivingmoney through Child Support, and insurance through the military and then my current job Istill hear nothing.In2011 I learned that my son was living with his grand parents Lawrence and Gayle Duranwho have systematically cut off all forms of communication with me, and my wife. Multiple calls have been made and when I did speak with his grandmother I was told that she wouldnt allow me to talk or video chat with my son till she got an okay from my sons mother. I was asked to sign a form for my son to get a passport however, when I said only on the terms that I can talk to my son and get pictures I was called a dead beat father and once again blocked from all communication. After informing the child support office of this, my tax returns and bank funds were still seized, limiting the funds at my disposal to financiallyback my search until 2015 and even after finding proof that he was no longer in his mothers care, Iwas simply told ""We only look in one direction, and that is yours for the money"". I now have two beautiful children, Jr (10) and Kaily (5) who have never even spoken to one another. All I m trying to do is be a father to both of my children. Im not looking to keep my son away from the family he knows, I only want share the rest of his family with him. My wife and I do not have the funds to solely devote to obtaining legal help and any help here in Minnesotajust redirects me to Las Vegas, and Las Vegas redirects me back here. I think it is absolutely insanethat I can sign up to fight and die for our country with little to no oppositionor difficulty, but the second I want to parent my children it is the most one sided, difficult, process I have ever dealt with. After all these years of trying it alone and failing, I MUST ask for yourhelp in any way possible. It is easy and common for a man to walk out on his child and giveup parental rights, but TO BE a father, even after DNA is tested and confirmed, I have to pay for the right to be acknowledged as something I already AM AND WANT to be. I am just looking for help getting the money raised to pay a lawyer and present all the documentation necessary to prove that I'vetried to be there and want to be there. I love my son and have never once wanted to be away from him. I only wanted to provide better for him. Please help me get started in getting him back in our lives. Sincerely thank you from the bottom of our hearts,The Mack Family

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.Several months ago, God came crashing into our lives. Ready or not, we heard His call loud and clear.Now, we are choosing to follow God all the way to Uganda, Africa in hopes of bringing home our child. We believe God's plan for our family is so much bigger than what we ever imagined. We can't wait to introduce you to our son, and Everly's brother, Otto (as we like to call him).Sharing our story to the world is scary. Scarier than we ever imagined. We are opening ourselves up to a world of criticism and judgment. But, God keeps reminding us to be brave because He knows the plans He has for us. So, as we step into unchartered waters, we invite you to take this journey with us.""You of little faith, why are you so afraid?""Whenever the fears of not having enough money to follow God's plan sink into our hearts and minds, this verse takes that fear away. God keeps reminding us to keep our faith big and our fear small.But, we do get afraid. As we've deleted and reworded this paragraph nothing else sounds better than just telling it like it is. It's not easy asking for help. But, we are asking for your prayers, your support, and your financial generosity. God never intended us to take this journey through life alone, and whether it's through your investment, your encouragement, or helping young Otto once we get him home, we need you.Please feel free to donate what you are able. Our good friends at BLDGdesigned an amazing tshirt to help portray our journey.This t-shirt includes a favorite line from the song, Oceans , by Hillsong United. We've found the phrase ""spirit lead me where my trust is without borders"" to speak exactly where we are...doing something we never would have intended, but leaning in to what we've been called to do.When making your contribution, please leave your t-shirt size (and number of t-shirts if you'd like multiple) in the comments section. We're requesting a minimum donation of $25/shirt but are grateful for anything you can offer.Words can't express our gratitude. All we can say is a deep thanks, and look forward to having you on this journey with us.Love,Adam, Rachel,and Everly

BROOKLYN, NY                                




Hi, my name is Blanca Rivadeneira, I currently live in Brooklyn, NY within the United States but I was originally born and raised in Ecuador. I wanted to share my story in hopes of getting help with the problem I am currently facing today. I'm currently going through a battle with my husband of 10 yearsforthe custody of our 2 young boys. I met my husband 10 years ago while he was vacationing in my country of Ecuador. He is 17 years older than me and when I met him, he was the kindest person I've ever met which led me to fall in love with him instantly. He broughtme to the united statesto marry him and start our own family. He told me I would never need to work as long as I took care of the children and made sure the house was in top shape while worked. He gave me everything and kept me dependent on him. My husband was worried I wouldleave him since I am much younger than him, so I was almost like a bird in a cage with no freedom to do anything but stay home and take care of the kids. I became completelydependent on this man. As time passed, he became very controlling and did not allowme work and always had an excuse when I wanted to do something to progress myself in life. I've never had a bank account or any credit cards. He never took me and the kids anywhere (Vacations, water parks, amusement parks) because his life was only dedicated to his work, while I am forced to stay home since I have no bank account, no money and my entire life is dependent on 1 person. Fast forward, our relationship started to go downhill based on the continuous fights we would have and the lack of communication we had. He worked 7 days a week and he barely had any time for us anymore. His life wasonly dedicated to work and we were just home mostof the time. By Feb 2016,due to our issues which wereaccumulating over the years,he decided to throw me out of the house and called the police on me. I was forced to leave and he had put an order of protection against me so I couldnt even come around to see my kids. He threw me out knowing I have no friends or family in the United States and no one to help me. All I had was the clothes I was wearing the night he kicked me out of the house. I had no money, no family, no friends. I ended up staying with a friend of my husband which we both knew for many years since I came to this country. I'm very grateful they took me in although they were really friends of my husband for many years even before I came to this country, but they alsoknew me and always invited us both to their home for holiday parties. They also helped me to find a room to rent since the court requires me to have a room or an apartment of my own in order for me to get visitation rights with my children which I can only see now for only 2 days (Bi-Weekly). His goal now is to try and take full custody of our 2 boys with no regard forme, his wife of 10 years. He hired a lawyer which he is able to afford since he owns properties, and has a goodamount of money in his bank. For me to have any chance of a fight for custody, I would need to hire my own lawyer to represent my case. Since I was always dependent on my husband and ever had to work, I am in a situation where I can barely afford the rent for the room Im renting on a part-time job. I would love to work full-time, however, because of all of the court appearances which are mandatory I am only able to work a part-time job until this entire case is closed.  Its very sad to see how my husband of 10 years is willing to destroyour family over money. He's always chosen money over his wife and kids and although he has custody of our 2 boys, he has hired a nanny to work 7 days while he continues to work every day instead of allowing me to see my kids. He tells the judge I am not a good mother, I was useless, dumb, and not a good wife in order to discredit me for the custody, while he has never dedicated any real time with his kids since he is always working. He would always abuse me physiologically calling me stupid, making me feel unappreciated and accusing me of being with him just for his money. He would always tell me Im nothing without him. Since the court case began,he now bribes our 2 boys with toys and video games in order for them to appear biased with their father over their mother for the court battle. He's willing to take the mother away from his kids and he is still not willing to dedicate time due to him always working 7 days a week. I've signed up with GoFundMe in hopes to raise $4,500 for my own lawyer who would help me fight for custody of my 2 boys which my husband is trying to take away from me, just to hurt me. He doesnt even care about his own kids, its all about hurting me as much as possible. The due date for me to find a lawyer to represent my case and pay the retainer fees is August17th 2016. There is a very good chance that I could lose the custody if I do not have a lawyer to fight for the custody of my 2 sons. This means so much to me because my 2 boys are my world and they are all I have right now. I want to raise my 2 boys and show them as much love as possible. They need to understand money is important, but family is the most important thing in life, but unfortunately, they will never learn this from their father. If I could raise the $4,500 I would be so grateful to the community of GoFundMe and appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. The money I'm raising will go directly to pay for the lawyer fees which gives me a fighting chance to have full custody of my 2 boys. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Wish me Luck! Blanca Rivadeneira

NORTH ROYALTON, OH                                





                        Hi my name is Kelly. If I had to define who I am in one word it would be ""mom""I have always been a private person...to proud to ever ask for help. Yet at age 30 ...here I am. I need hope and support. I need people.On July 5, 2014 my children and I were physically locked out of our home. It was not a perfect home. I hid and lied about our life behind closed doors. Like many who remain quiet I was victim of various types of abuse. At the time I believe he had no interest in being a dad...I knew that and that is why I had stayed. Because I could always protect my kids and overcompensate for the love he did not give them. I was scared to leave in fear of losing my kids. I knew all to well that it would be a battle driven by power and control and appearance. I had lost the fighter in me over the years. I just wanted to love my kids. I had no fight and little confidence to go against him or anyone for that matter. I just tried to keep the peace. Maintain the appearance of a beautiful, happy family. Appearance and status were important to keep peace at home.[Beyond all this I loved his family and mom. I didn't want to lose them or her. His mom became my second mom over the years. I also didn't want a broken family to hurt her. I loved them and still do. ]My kids' father kept all that we had. Everything I had ever worked for He kept, A custody battle began as he set out on mission to destroy. When keeping tangible items from me for over 6 months did not work such as our beds and clothing...he dragged the custody battle out longer demanding I have a psych. Evaluation. This automatically tacked 6 months onto our case. Per court orders which I was fighting...I only had my children m-F. Only problem was that I had just gotten my first 9-5 job that June. Which meant I would pay for day care m-f and have my kids from 530-bedtime. All parents know that is the hardest timeframe with little ones. I made the best of it. After 5 months of sleeping on couches with my infant and 3.5 year old I got us an apartment. Unfurnished we slept on an air mattress until that spring when I could afford a real mattress. We slept sideways... The 3 of us...every night I would sing my own made up song and version of Hail Mary.As the months passed on being alone every weekend I sunk into a deadly depression. Financially I was dying and told no one. Emotionally I was dead. This continued on for months. I then realized that my medicine I had been on for over 3 years worked as a numbing agent when I took more. When I ran out I learned my psychiatrist had messed up and I had over 40 refills available. It wasn't a controlled medication and somehow Walgreens never stopped me from filling very week paying out of pocket. This medication which was my crutch would eventually be my demise. Gabapetin.I never asked for help I was so lost. I had isolated myself from everyone. I didn't want anyone to see how depressed I actually was. I would lay on the floor in my apartment every weekend begging God to make the pain stop. Eventually I began to realize how much gabapetin I was actually taking daily. Between 18,000&30,000mg a day. I was jaundice and 30 lbs under normal weight . I researched the medicine and learned that it could in fact worsen depression and lead to suicide. I didn't know what to do.Well when I finally broke down about my depression and my medicine. It was to the wrong person. My kids dad. In less a month he convinced my ENTIRE family I was an addict. I lost my ENTIRE family and I was the outcast. The addict. Lost and alone I just wanted to have my family back...I agreed to do the only thing that I thought would achieve that. I signed myself in to glenbeigh rock creek on 9-16-15 for a 30 day inpatient drug rehabilitation center.I was 29 and scared to death of leaving my babies for a month. The first few days were really hard. Then I was able to talk to the kids on the phone. Their voices were happy and peaceful. They were ok with out me for a short time and they were being taken care of and loved.I felt at peace immediately with my decision. I began to feel content at glenbeigh. The negative connotation that was connected to the title ""addict"" soon dissappeared. We were all there to heal our hearts...regardless of the disease we battled.I learned how to love, care, laugh and trust. I met the most amazing people. Moms just like me. However one person in particular will always hold a special place in my heart.Lori Jo Montgomery was her name. She is a counselor assistant and she and I clicked. She was crazy and kind and had this hope and joy for life that I craved. She took me under her wing ... I was her ""mini me"". I felt accepted for who I am ... With out any masks or walls. I allowed others to love me and me them. I developed lifelong friendships with the most beautiful women who all battled their own disease. Mothers. Teachers. Nurses. Artists. Beautiful strong woman who taught me so much.glenbeigh taught me how to love myself and feel at peace. I felt a happiness and love i never knew before.While in glenbeighI had to quit my job. I lost my insurance. I have spent the last year in an out of hospitals. Diagnosed with PTSD, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY & ADHD. At times I was homeless sleeping in my car. I spent my entire tax return to secure an apartment with 6 months paid. That same week My ex was granted temporary custody of our kids and I would only be allowed to see them during supervised visits. One week later...on my way to the kids grandmas house to make Minnie Mouse Oreo cookies for my daughters 2nd birthday... I was hit by another driver and my 2005 Honda Odyssey was totaled.Until 2 weeks ago I battled alone. Finally my mom who despised me for so long..... It was her who finally acknowledged that addiction was not what I was battling. Mental illness had taken over my life. She saw it. One family member supporting my recovery from a debilitating disease was all I needed to care again. It gave me hope.The custody battle is coming to end. 10/24 is day 1 of our trial. I have a lot to do to get on my feet in the next month. Most importantly starting with my health and stabilizing my medications. However - that involves me going to an inpatient facility.Unfortunately, however after 6 months of living alone in a sad grey unfurnished apartment with no laughter and toys...now I really need help. I need to take care of myself and my mental health and at the same time...I am scared to death of losing this home which my kids have been begging me to bring them here to stay. I'm in a very scared place and I'm asking for help.my son who will be 6 in November keeps talking about his new bedroom. My daughter who is now 2.5 cries at night when I call to sing to them...asking ""mommy bring me to your house please""ive lost 2 years with my babies. I can't give up. And I can't lose another home that they have yet to live at.so beyond help with paying my rent I need hope...please. If you can donate $1 & share this with just one friend ....that would be amazing. if you cannot I understand completely.Instead of $1 if you could send acard or picture or anything to bring hope to my grey walls....that would be beyond appreciated...kids artwork...notes of inspiration ...to bring life and joy ....I want to cover my grey walls by October 24th....with hope.More than anything...I need people. I isolated myself for far too long and it broke me in a way I cannot explain.I need to know There are people out there who believe in me.My parents have sacrificed far too much financially without my asking...and it breaks my heart what they have endured emotionally and financially,..also through this ....battle. Please keep them in your prayers as well.it is my hope to both raise enough money to pay my rent and get on my feet. I'm rebuilding my life from scratch.thank you for reading my story.love peace and hope,kelly

PORTLAND, OR                                





                        Hellofriends & family of Rick & Kristin. As you all know the little ones will be joining them sometime in the next 8 weeksand as most of you also probably know ... with a new babe comes a few challenges, especially around sleep.So, seeing as they'll have TWO new babes, chances are BOTH of them will sleep a whole lot less than the new parents of just onekiddo. And a whole lot less than really makes any sense at all.UNLESS, WE HELP....So, instead of zillions of pink & blue onesies, we're encouraging folk to throw a few bucks this way and help buy Rick & Kristin some sleep,IE. a littlesanity in those early days;)How this works:We're looking to get themhelp through ABCDoulas, with whom they've already taken a great twins class. The doulas spend nights with new parents, helping them get a little sleep,while they juggle / feed / bounce / soothe / change / shush / cuddle / feed again / change again / shush again / feed again / soothe again /change again etc the little ones.It costs approximately $280 for an overnight. And as anyone who's experienced sleepless nights can attest to, it can be really really intense - and tough on the mental & physical health of the new parents. So, my hope is that we can raise enough money for these two to get actual sleep at least once a week for a couple of months... Hence our minimum goal of $2500.The doulas can also help with breastfeeding, baby soothing techniques, baby wearing of twins,general choresaround the house and simply helping new parents get a handle onthis huge transition.So... thank you thank you lovelyfolk. Please let me know if you have specific questions about this.And here's to the gentlest of beginnings for Kristin & Rick and their sweet babes!!!- LeoniePS. For any of you who are still wavering between that stuffed bunny present and donating towards an overnight doula...

IVF Fundraiser - For Future Parents,"$1,020 ","$15,000 ",Family," January 4, 2016",19,8,NORWOOD,MO,188000,1,4,"






                            Tonya Perreaux
                            
                            
                                                           
NORWOOD, MO                                




Our Story:


My favorite stories are those about friendship. When people are honest and selfless with each other, their relationship can blossom into a fruitful one.


Tonya and I were friends at first. We met at work. We chatted about casual stuff, and helped each other excel at work. When our friendship turned into romance, we couldn't be happier. I knew we would be together forever mostly because of this conversation we had when we first began to fall in love:


Back then, Tonya noticed how I talked fondly about my brother, sister, and mom, and how important my family obviously is to me, so she asked:


Tonya: Do you want to have kids in the future?


Eric:  No doubt about it.


-pause-


Tonya:  I would only be able to have children through IVF because I had a procedure done years ago. IVF is expensive and I would be putting my body through a lot, but I would be willing to do it, if you would.


-pause-

Eric: Hmm, let's take a look...


So I Google IVF, not being familiar with it. Average health risks and prices and.. uh oh, it all seemed like a significant sacrifice to make just to have a child, with no guarantees of success. It all seemed overwhelming. So I looked at Tonya and said,


I would be willing to do this with you


And I meant it. 2  years later. I still mean it.


We were both honest and selfless when we had that conversation.


We were married 1 year after having that talk. Then we had 2 unsuccessful pregnancy attempts in a 6 month span with mediocre fertility doctors in Syracuse, NY. The doctors had every opportunity to diagnose an ovarian cyst they kept identifying in ultrasound after ultrasound, as a problem that would complicate the pregnancy. But instead, they said it would not be a health concern.


This condition became worse after she took the prescribed medications and we were weeks into the pregnancy. It caused her to have emergency surgery after we lost the baby, and she almost lost an ovary, as well. What an ordeal and unnecessary pain and suffering for Tonya. All of which could have been prevented if the aforementioned doctors had competence and conviction.


With well over $15,000 of our hard earned money wasted, we only had an unsuccessful seven week pregnancy to show for it. And yet, that silver lining, that she did conceive on the first try, gives us hope that we may have a successful pregnancy in the future.


We also smartened up and gathered information and resources in order to give ourselves the best chance of having a baby. A big sacrifice had to be made: moving 1100 miles cross-country to be treated by one of best doctors in the field. This guy is rated a top ten fertility doctor in the country, and must be paid accordingly. A single cycle of IVF, with a quality doctor such as Dr. Silber in St Louis, MO, will cost between $12500-$15000.


We are moving to a new home, away from friends and everything else we held dear our whole lives to make a solid attempt at achieving our IVF goal. We pursue our goals as a family with total confidence that we are making the right decision. It's the best move for our kids as well as for Tonya and I.


New romance is pure bliss, and may gradually fade due to differences that are hard to cope with: money, stress, abuse, jealousy, disruptive family/friends, strong-willed partners who butt heads too often, etc., etc., (fill in the blank).


Tonya and I certainly wouldn't allow petty nonsense to come between us, and I always knew we would get along just fine. We knew family was important to us. I make an effort to be a good father to my 13 and 15 year old step-sons. We have sacrificed a lot for each other. We have dreams, and both have the motivation and work ethic to accomplish what we put our minds to do. But a baby? Well, I humbly admit, that is in Gods hands!


We understand the risks and the probabilities of a successful pregnancy, and know that time and science are not on our side, but we will not let obstacles or the tragedies we have been through be nagging thorns that keeps us from smelling the flourishing rose at the top.


Any donations to help our cause would be appreciated greatly, and may God give those who donate prayers and funds a return in blessings and prosperity. Thank you in advance for your consideration.


Kind Regards,


Eric & Tonya Perreaux



Our Ask:


We ask for your support and encouragement in any way your heart is driving you to support us. We appreciate donations, prayers, and you simply spreading the word. We have already saved and spent over $15,000 in the past by doing this process and now we've found one of the best doctors in the country to do this. We would like your financial support so we can work with this doctor and become blessed parents. We appreciate all of your love and support.


Our Prayer:


Jesus, we are eternally grateful for your constant faithfulness and for having incredible plans for our lives. We praise you for all that you've done, you're doing, and you continue to do in our lives. We know that the desire to be parents is coming from you. You have called us to be parents and we are confident that you will fulfill your promises as you always do in your own way and in your own time.

WEATHERFORD, OK                                





                        Eric and Carrie Loper have devoted their hearts, home, and lives to the service of others, from their careers to foster care and adoption. Unfortunately now their family needs help... 3 of the Loper's adopted children are desperately struggling to fit in their new loving and safe home environment. Having not spent their young lives in this type of environment it has been very hard to adjust. In researching and speaking with other families who have struggled with children suffering from attachment issues the Lopers have found a camp that could help them and teach them how to successfully transition the children into their home and family. The camp is called Camp Attach and is in Florida from November 13-19. Carrie and Eric have made the decision to go no matter what it takes, so that their family and these hurt children can have every opportunity to heal. So let's help make that happen! When I asked Carrie if I could set this up she was uncertain at first because naturally they are helpers and it is hard to ask for help. Please help show The Lopers how friends and family can support and encourage. I know many will think the dollar amount is high... Please remember this is the cost of camp ($5400), airfaire ($2500), 2 car rentals for 1 week ($600), hotel stay for 2 rooms/2 nights ($500), and any other incidentals for 10 People!!! I have attached the link to Camp attach for anyone wanting more info before donating. Please help! http://www.attachment.org/parents/camps/florida-camp/

Annie is only 2 and hasn't done anything to deserve this. Her parents are both in prison and she is not in a very good place.Annie's mother and I were very close friends before she let her life spiral away from God and to drugs.Her mother was sent this photo in prison.This is the only thing she has seen or heard about her daughter in 10 months. The people that have Annie have cut off all contact from both parents and family that want to be a part of sweet Annie's life, including her siblings, 11 yr old sister and 7 yr old brother, who miss her very much.

The people who have her now, only have temporary guardianship and the mother has sole custody, but being in prison it's been hard to get anything done. The mother wasan addictbutnow being clean for 10 months knows she made a mistake signing temporary guardianship over to them. She filed to have temporary guardianship terminated and given to my husband and me. The people who currently have Annie havefiled an appeal.So we will now go to court and we need to raise money for a lawyer and for when we get Annie (I have to believe we will).

We areable to provide a stable and consistent environment for Annieas we have done for our son who is now 19 and attending UNG.We have regular contact with Annie'sother family and we already get to haveher sister and brother at our home often.I believeGod has led me to help this little girl. Any amount you can donate will help us in this fight. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

The Griffith's Guinea Adoption,"$9,298 ","$25,000 ",Family," August 15, 2016",21,1,DENVER,CO,108000,,,"






                            Kristin Griffith
                            
                            
                                                           
DENVER, CO                                





                        Hello! We're Jeremy and Kristin Griffith. Many of you may know our story but many of you may not. We have always known we would adopt. In fact, before we were even married, it was a decision we talked about and from early on, God burdened our hearts with a love for orphans in other parts of the world. In 2013, I (Kristin) went to Ghana to serve at an orphanage and fell in love with the kids and culture. Jeremy and I were still waiting to have kids, but as the days went on, I felt an urge to adopt from Ghana. When I returned home, I waited a week to even tell Jeremy. Throughout the next few months we discussed adopting from Ghana and decided we were ready. Unfortunately, Ghana had put a temporary hold on all international adoptions, so we waited. The following summer, I returned to Ghana, with Jeremy this time, and witnessed him fall in love with Ghana the way I did the summer before. Fall of 2014 brought good news of Ghana being willing to work with the adoption agency we had decided to process our adoption through. We were ecstatic! We started our adoption paperwork and were anxious to get going. Through God's grace and leading, we were able to pay for half of the adoption costs without any added debt. We sold many possessions, used savings, and worked extra hours. I still am not sure how it all added up, but He made it work. Last week, we were about half way through our adoption process, and our agency decided to close their Ghana program due to extreme difficulties working within the country. I can't explain the emotional rollercoaster this summer has been, and although we are heartbroken by this decision, we know our agency ismaking the best decision for the current situation in Ghana.With a continued desire to grow our family through adoption, we were led to a different agency that works with Guinea in west Africa. Adoptions processed with Guinea happen fairly quickly because their process is more streamlined and organized. Unfortunately, we have already paid for half of the Ghana adoption and will be receiving only about a 5% refund from our first agency.Unsure of how we will make these next adoption payments once we start our adoption withGuinea this fall, we are asking for your help. We ask that you PRAY! Pray for wisdom and clarity as we navigate this new adoption process, for patience and strength, and for God to provide for our financial needs and for the needs of our future childin Guinea. We also need help raising funds. If you at all feel led to invest in our adoption and growing family, please help by either donating to help fund our adoption or share this link on your Facebook page, Instagram, Twitter or with your friends and family and let them know that you know us personally.We're always asked how much adoption costs or why it costs so much, so we're including a breakdown of our adoption costs to provide some clarification and to be completely transparent.$6,700 - Pre-Adoption fees (including Homestudy & USCIS)$8,350 - Adoption Agency fees (work done on the US side of adoption)$9,800 - Foreign Fees (work being done in Guinea, including lawyer fees, court fees, government fees, etc.)$5,000 - Travel Expenses (round trip flights for two people, one way flight for our future child, visas, lodging, etc.)$6,150 -More In-Aountry fees(child's passport and documentation, orphanage costs, etc.)$1,300 -Post Adoption (processing fee, orphanage support fees)Total adoption cost: $37,300This adoption process has been so difficult, financially and emotionally, but God has been so faithful and has provided in great ways.We know that God has put this calling on our lives and has grown this deep love for the fatherless within us. Thank you so very much, from the bottom of our hearts, for your financial contribution and prayers!Much Love,Jeremy & Kristin Griffith**GoFundMe charges a percentage fee of each donation and money withdrawl.

                        One giant leap to have four brighter futures! To more than double our children from three to seven! To lighten their load of the life they were given. To insure that four children are not a statistic in the world of foster children, To help them aim for success and unlock higher destinations we welcome them in with love and compassion! It's a marvelous adventure ahead with needs to be met! We hope for a home expansion and a van to seat a dozen! A nice back up fund for other needs to be met such as School supplies and sports would make us jump to the stars! Any thing is possible and can be archived! Wish big, Dream large, Make it happen!Joe's and my story began long ago, we have worked hard to make a life with a solid foundation for ourselves and our three daughters! It was in July of this year that I received a phone call about another relatives four children who were in need of a forever home due to unspecified circumstances, it was a decision that came easy the answer was obvious, the answer was YES of course we will take them. With family behind our decision we are moving forward, we are waiting on paperwork from the two states to go thru so they can stay here perminatly. Right now they are coming for everyother weekend visits until the paperwork is finished. With 7 kids in total my 7 passenger van is just not large enough to fit everyone so juggling that has been a challenge. We could trade our current van however being a 2000 the trade value is not significant. So In the mean time not having them full time we are hoping to make possible the purchase of a larger van to fit all of us so we can function like a family these children deserve. Yes of course there are other needs however a large challenge at this time is transportation. If we don't reach our goal any money will be used towards the down payment of that van. I want to thank all of the family that has helped in this journey so far, the emotional support, clothing, bikes, and bedding among many other things has helped to make these kids feel at home during there visits with us!

Help Crystal,$145 ,"$5,500 ",Family," September 13, 2016",5,12,WAYNE,NJ,39000,,,"






                            Michelle Taormina Johnson
                            
                                                            on behalf of Crystal Madison

WAYNE, NJ                                




Crystal is not only my best friend, but she is one of the most generous people you would ever meet. I have known her for about 20 years now. We have seen each other through good and bad times. However, right now I am heartbroken for her because I feel so helpless. She is going through such a difficult time and really needs some help. I would like to take this time to share with you her story:When I first met Crystal, we were both young and single. We hit it off right from the get go. Over time, our friendship grew and I cannot imagine my life without her. She got married, had a son right about the same time I got married. She has since had another beautiful baby and is an amazing mother. Her boys adore her. And it is no surprise why. Everything she does is in the best interest of their well-being. Everything she has, she gives.... her love, her joy, her dedication... I would say her attention, but she doesn't have that to give. :) But it just makes her more fun to be around.Sadly, her marriage did not work out. Her and her ex-husband grew apart and in the best interest of them and the boys, it was time for them to divorce. Not to say she did not give that all that she had either. Once she commits to something, she is dedicated. But it was no longer a healthy environment.Being a single mom is tough. Probably one of the hardest things to do. But, it never stopped Crystal. She worked very hard, going to school to get an education, working three jobs and still proving above and beyond for her two extraordinary boys. And as hard as things have gotten for her, she was still always there for me. Even after she moved across the country to be closer to her family.Since then God has blessed her with an incredible man, Spencer. He is truly a gift from God. He has shown her nothing but love and respect. He has made her the happiest I have ever seen her, with the exception of her boys. I thank God for him. He is her support, her rock and the man of her dreams. And I am so happy to announce, they got engaged on November 7, 2015. They are perfect for each other. And not only that, but he loves her boys more than you could imagine. He will be a wonderful stepdad and role model to both of them. I am very thankful the boys have him in their lives. I miss her so much. And I hate not being there for her now. Besides, the fact that I love hanging out with her, It is excruciatingly painful to not be able to be a better support to her right now. Let me explain:Only July 14th, as she was driving home from work and was rear-ended while at a complete stop being hit by a courier van. Fortunately, she was not critically hurt, but when the paramedics arrived they noticed her speech was slurred and thought it was best to bring her to the hospital to get checked out. While in the ER, she got a CT scan, which not only showed she had a concussion, but she also had a brain tumor.... a pituitary macroadenoma. This just goes to show what the enemy means to harm us (the accident and concussion), God uses to bless us. If it were not for the CT, God only knows when, if ever the brain tumor would have been found.As if she was not going through enough, when she returned to work on July 19th, she was fired. No real reason was given. She was just let go. She had given her all to this position. She sacrificed holidays with her kids, plays, school, milestone events and even a court custody hearing because she had no time to spare. She had been saving money for a lawyer to deal with the custody issues of her children because prior to that, she was representing herself. And although she is very smart, she never went to law school. But she did not let that stop her from trying.You can only imagine how devastated she was when they told her she was no longer employed. Not only that, but shocked. Just recently she told me how the CEO himself was praising her for all her hard work and efforts, and how much she had completed in her short time there. It seemed like such a great fit. She loved this job. She talked about it all the time, took her kids to work with hergetting let go was as devastating as it ever got.Now unemployed, with a concussion and a tumor and her health insurance is about to run out at the end of July, Crystals world started to collapse. But most devastating to her is the fact that she has no way to provide for her boys. The tumor is growing and it needs to be removed, as its pressing down on her optic chiasm. But as always, she can only think of her boys and how she will not be able to take care of them during her stay in the hospital and recovery time. The surgery is straightforward and she was blessed with one of the best neurosurgeons in Minnesotabut still. She was very overwhelmed and scared. Thankfully, her fiance, Spencer has been there for her and her boys through it all. Crystal is one of the strongest people I know. She has gone through so much. She has overcome many challenges. She never gives up. I had never seen her like this before. For the first time ever, she felt hopeless.Finally, on September 1st, she was operated on and the tumor was removed. The surgery took five hours and the tumor was over 2cm large, putting her at risk for losing her peripheral vision in less than a year. Although the surgery was a success, Crystal developed diabetes insipidus and Cushing's syndrome. With time and the healing power of God, those will go away. She is recovering and is in good medical care, and the doctors are very pleased with her progress. But shes still very down. Shes thankful to God for guiding the surgeons hands, and she tries not to let the finances scare her, but shes worried she cant find another job, the bills piling up, and on and on.Where does this leave her? The bills are piling up and that isn't even considering the hospital bills and doctor bills that will start pouring in any day now. And her dream of getting married on her wedding date of October 8th is now out of the question. She is beyond depressed that she can no longer buy Spencer a wedding band as all she had saved up is gone just trying to live each day.I am eternally grateful to anyone who is willing to give any amount to help Crystal and her family get back on her feet. The money that you so generously donate will be going towards bills, a child custody lawyer, a honeymoon, which she and Spencer do desperately need right now. Through all of this, he has been right by her side doing everything he can to provide for her. But as you can imagine, he too is completely overwhelmed. Any additional money will go to helping them find a new place to live as her apartment, although lovely, is getting too small with these young men she is raising.Again, that you for listening to her story, for lifting her and her family up in prayers and of course, for anything that you can give to help my best friend who is very much in need. Thank you and God Bless you all.

I am a hard working single mom with two disabled children trying to keep my family together. My son has Autism and my daugther has Chronic Lyme Disease. Our family has been homeless since January 2nd of this year. I lost my job in September of 2015, due to having to take too much time off to care for my daughter. I have been unable to find work since then.My son got his diagnosis of Aspergers late in life and is struggling with the social aspect of every day interactions with people. He tries and is successful in some areas, but he struggles and is not able to hold a job due to his many social anxieties. My daughter got her diagnosis of Chronic Lyme Disease back in February of 2013, a few months before graduating high school. She was tutored from home the majority of her senior year, while dealing with her medical issues. She fights a number of medical issues caused or in conjunction with the Chronic Lyme , such as IBS, intractable migraines, thyroid disease, and possible Endometriosis. We try to keep up with treatments, but the doctor visits are extremely expensive and out of pocket to treat the Lyme. I have been unable to take my daughter to be treated for almost a year and a half now, due to the expense of seeing a Lyme Literate doctor. I am working my hardest to just keep my family together under one roof. We cannot go to a shelter, since we have 2 cats and a dog. They are emotional support animals for the entire family, and keep the calm and stress levels down, which is extremely important for the well being of myself and my kids. Aside from the animal aspect, 211 (emergency housing), would have to put my son in a totally different area of shelter housing because of his age, which is not a possiblilty due to his needs and the care I provide for him. The main use of the funds would be used for housing and anything above and beyond for my daughters medical needs. The funds would be used immediately for housing needs.A friend urged me to do this. I'm not someone who puts all their personal stuff out there so this is extemely difficult for me. I am very grateful for everyone in my life who has ever done anything for myself and my family. Whether it has been monitary or just being a solid person for emotional support.Grateful, wouldn't begin to describe how thankful I'd be for the generosity of all the people who cared enough to reach out and help my family and myself.

This morning, they were heavy on my heart and I was praying to God asking Him how I could help them......although I don't have extra money to give them right now...so I was asking the Lord, ""what can I do Lord? I have nothing extra to give"".....Immediately, the Lord gave me the idea to give my painting away to help her. My painting is a bird on a branch inspired by the scripture:Matthew 6:26 ""Look at the birds. They dont plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And arent you far more valuable to him than they are?""I can't do a give away on go fund me but if you want to donate to help the mom and her kids in need here you can! I'll figure something else out on how to give the painting away, I just can't use this platform and that's ok! I started painting about 6 months ago, this painting is inspired by the artist Deann her website is  http://www.deanndesigns.com.Thank you God Bless!!

When I read this---I had to do something. Please stop this 'lunch shaming'which is hurting the children and making them go hungry. It is NOT the children's fault and children should never be placed in the middle. Contribute please.

                        Ian has been given the amazing opportunity of attending Camp Manatawny because of the selfless generosity of members of the King of Prussia Church of Christ. He is attending their overnight camp for 1st and 2nd graders this week, and while I'm a wreck because we've never been apart even for a night, I know he's having an absolute blast and making some life long memories.I'm starting this fundraiser to gather donationsfor the King of Prussia Church of Christ, because they've covered Ian's cost of attending the camp 100% without expecting a single penny in return.They know we don't attend the church, and I'm sure they know that I'm not particularly religious. But to make a long story short, they've given my son an incredible opportunity that I would not have been able to give him myself, and for that I will be forever grateful. On top of all of the normal camp activities like horseback riding, swimming, and outdoor adventures, he will have the chance to learn about religion. Again, most of you know I'm not too religious myself, but Ian has been very curious about it lately and has had questions, and I'd never deprive him the chance to learn and figure out for himself what he wants to believe in.Whether you're religious, agnostic, spiritual, or none of the above -please consider donating if you can. If not for the church, then for me & my son. I'd love to be able to raise enough to cover the full cost of camp for the week, and then some. I'll never be able to thank them enough for providing us this opportunity, but hopefully this will be a good start for Ian & myself to show them how much their generosity has meant to the both of us.Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks in advance if you plan to donate. Please feel free to share this with anyone you know, it means a lot to me & my son.Stefanie HolbrookKing of Prussia Church of Christ website: http://www.kopchurch.org/Camp Manatawny website: http://www.manatawny.org/

                        My husband became disabled and isn't getting disability yet, so we are solely relying on the income i get for 2 of our boys, so i am trying to raise money to pay our back property taxes before next month or our home goes up for sale and trying to raise money to get us another trailer to replace ours because its in rough shape and it would cost more to fix than what this other trailer costs ,and to get the permits to be able to move the replacement to our lot, and in order to move it we have to have the back taxes paid. And also we are in danger of losing our phone service which i need to keep in touch with the school. I am just wanting right now what my family desperatly needs.

We have been homeless for over a year, but thankfully for my wife's beat friend Amy she took my family in to her home for the first 5 months of us being homeless. My mom and sister and tabs and Jose helped us and allowed us to stay with them until they themselves were forced to move out of their home and into apartments that we couldn't follow either of them. That left me and and my family struggling to at the cheapest motel in town and paying $2000 a month at motel 6. I'm at verge of losing my job because of my absences of struggling to find a way to pay for my wife and kids to be safe at night while im at work at night. I'm doing all that I can to not have my wife and kids sleeping in the rain outside.i donate plasma twice a week and working at Wal-Mart is not enough to get ahead and save money for application fe jes, food, or deposits. I've tried all resources dshs, council for the homeless, Vancouver housing authority,churches,salvation army,aspire,shelters. I even went and talked to my store manager at Walmart and I don't qualify for Associates in Critical Need Trust. Please I need help and don't know what else to do. I need to make it till next payday October 6.

We are the Bryant's. Travis. Hannah. Kappie. 


We love each other & God fiercely and have been trying to start our family for three years. In the summer of 2014, after a lot of deliberate prayer, we decided to adopt. We are choosing to adopt domestically for a number of reasons, one of which is we believe in having a relationship with the birth mother and supporting her however we can. 


There is so much more we could and would love to tell you about our story, our heartache, and our hope for the future. If you'd like to learn more about our heart and journey, check outLife in the Trees, a blog about our adoption and embracing life. 


Thank-you for supporting us and our pursuit of family. You are loved and cherished. We leave you with this Psalm, it's one that we go to again and again. Our prayer is that you also pour out your heart to God, and trust Him in all times. 


Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him. Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge. Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. -Psalm 62: 5-8 


Please continue to pray for our family! 


Love, 


Travis & Hannah (and Kappie too!)

BUFFALO, NY                                





                        I have fallen...I have fallen into the worst time of my life the last 2 years. I have lost my wife of 15 years, my job, my back (injured at work in 2014 and now 50% permanently disabled.), My home and most importantly my two children. Have you ever had your world just fall completely apart? So bad you feel like it will never get back up again? That is what happened to me. Last October I was pretty much forced out of my home with my children and wife and went to live with a friend because I could not afford to have my own place thanks to my injury (no help from the state and very very little from work comp...600 a month little). My friend, he has very bad bi polar condition and is 60 years old and lives alone with a dog. He made me live in a storage room that was still half full, with a door that had no handle. I had to do all of the chores around the house including his soiled laundry. I was only allowed to leave 1 day a week and had to be home by 10 pm or he would lock me out of the house and scream at me for several hours. He would only let me see my kids for 6 hrs a week on Saturday only. I finally got a job that payed very little and thank God I found a cheep place in a bad neighborhood, an hour away form my children. The schools in my area are rated F-, the worst you can get. There was NO way I could let my children live with me and go to those schools. Besides I can not even afford to feed myself. I eat 1 meal a day just so I can make sure to have enough for my kids during the weekends, which is the only time I can see them right now because I live so far away. I had to escape by packing up piece by piece and every morning before he was awake I would take some things to my car and hide them in my trunk. Mind you I have very little so there was not much to hide. One day before I was able to move into my own place I snuck the remaining articles of positions I had left in that house to my car and left....for good. Now, I am in a job that kills my back every single job that pays pennies and I can not affor to be with my children and every single day it KILLS me inside. They are my world in every single way and I need with all my heart to move to the town they are in and be with them. My kids have told me that they would live with me even with a 1 bedroom place that we would make it work daddy, as long as you are with us. We will make it work. My children are my life. The pain of loosing EVERYTHING you held so dear almost over night...it is overwhelming. The depression is real and is a daily battle. The only time I am happy is when I am with my kids. I do have another job but it does not pay until the game releases for another year at the very earliest. (I am a game designer). I am also a published author who makes no more royalties (my book is called Continia) and my publisher is asking me to finish more books. I do not have the time with this terrible job. I need funding to help me move to the same town as my kids so they do not have to leave their fantastic school in the village they grew up in and can support myself and them while I finish the game and my next book. I need your help, a friend of mine asked me to do this saying he hated seeing me in so much pain and misery. So, I finally agreed to swallow what pride I have left and ask for you help to allow me to be a full time dad again. Thank you so much for reading this. If you have decided to help me I am forever in your debt with my most heart felt thank you. It is not just me you are helping but my beautiful daughter and hansom son. One day I hope to help people on this site as you have helped me. I believe all good deeds deserve another and another. God Bless.

                        I have a friend that is in a financial bind and has lost everything due to a long custody battle for his daughter. My friend was married to the girl of his dreams and they have a beautiful little girl. One day his wife came home and said she wanted out of the marriage and she was involved with another person. She moved out and took their daughter leaving him devasted and shocked. He loves his daughter and hired a lawyer to fight for custody. This has been going on since October 2015. He has been financially emotionally physically ruined by these chain of events and had to give up this fight due to financial reasons. My friend and his daughter have been put through hell which has left them both devastated.He is a loving father and kind man. If anyone could contribute any amount to help him out it would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.

                        My name is Andy Barnett, I am best friends with thebelow recipients of this fundraiser.  Will and Katie are unaware of this and we are hoping to surprise them with the funds.Will and Katie Albiero are high school sweet-hearts who got married on 12/8/12 and were thrilled to have become pregnant with their first child earlier this year. Nathan Victor Albiero was born at 24 weeks on 6/24/16 and has been in the neonatal intensive care unit ever since. He spent 6 weeks on a ventilator and continues to need respiratory assistance. Due to his fragile, day to day status, Nathan is expected to stay in the NICU until October and Will and Katie canonly pray and cheer him on. Any parent can understand the emotional turmoil they must be enduring. To go along with the emotional distress, the average cost of the NICU is around $3,000 per day and average cost of a premature baby is $41,610. Regardless of insurance status, this is a hefty expense for a young family, therefore Will and Katie's family and friends are raising money to help pay for their medical bills. We are also hosting a poker tournamentfundraiseron 10/15/16 where half of the proceeds go to Will and Katie as well. If interested in the poker game, you can contact me via this go fund me page.This page will be open until the poker tournament where we will ultimately tally up the donations to see if we've hit our goal.Any donation, big or small, will be greatly appreciated and mean the world to Will andKatie, as well as their family and friends.

Empower a Congolese Single Mom,$175 ,"$5,000 ",Family," March 26, 2016",3,6,KANSAS CITY,MO,16000,,3,"

KANSAS CITY, MO                                





                        This fund is set up on behalf of Caroline Uwimana. Caroline arrived in the United States almost two years ago as a refugee from Congo, Africa. She lived outside of Goma and had to flee her home with her friends and family to escape warfare.She is a tall, thin, kind, single, young lady in her late twenties. She has just found out that she is five months pregnant. She is going to be a wonderful mother. She is always caring for neighborhood children.She was previously staying with a family, but is now moving into a public housing apartment of her own. She will have a few things for herself, but nothing for the baby. She has a job, but it does not pay much and she will have to take time off for the birth as well as pay for child care to get back to work. She is still paying back the government for her relocation loan. She has no car. She has some friends and a church family (who are also refugees), but her mother and father are no longer living and her siblings are still in Africa. The odds are against her.I met Caroline through an organization that resettles refugees in Kansas City where I volunteer as a mentor. As Caroline's mentor, I help her adjust to life in America by taking her out to see the city, practice English, and have fun. I also do my best to help with things like public housing, green card application, understanding bills, etc. We have been friends now for almost two years. I would love to set her up with a fantastic baby room and supplies to ease the burden of moving out on her own into single parentship. I'm asking you to please help Caroline and her baby.I have set up a registry and we picked out things together. It totals about $3,500 for the big items and some nice extras. The other $1,500 will be for food and anything else that comes up. I don't believe those in need should have to bereduced to used and super cheapitems. If we don't meet our goal, I'll work with some local organizations to get her what she needs. but after a hard life wouldn't it be amazing for her to be able to give her baby so much more?? I think it will do wonders for her self-confidence and happiness for the difficult journey she has ahead. Here is the link to the registry: http://registry.thebump.com/caroline-uwimana-seana-wilkerson-august-2016/14647651You can purchase items direct on the registry and I will pick them up in store or have them shipped here. I will hold everything in my apartment's storage space until she gets her new place. You can also just donate money that we will use for last minute things or food. You can find me on Venmo (@Seana-Wilkerson) also to send money.

This fund is a small way that we can show them support, share in their excitment, and bless their family. There are so many expenses that come with adoption and this money will go directly toward helping them offset some of the adoption and travel expenses. This fund is a SURPRISE that I will hand over to them on May 7th. You may continue to give past that date, but please have your donations in before then if at all possible. I know that they are going to feel so encouraged and loved by the support from all of you. Thank you!

A Single-Mothers Maternity Leave,"$1,150 ","$3,500 ",Family," September 20, 2016",3,5,BALTIMORE,MD,9000,1,,"






                            Alandra Nicole Schlosberg Moreira
                            
                            
                                                           
BALTIMORE, MD                                





                        My name is Alandra Moreira. I am a pregnant single mother (2 year old and another on the way) living in a bad neighborhood in Baltimore City and I need help. Ultimately my goal is to move out of this neighborhood but right now I have more urgent matters that I need help with.Here is my situation. I will not be able to afford my bills this winter with what I make for a living. I make 1750/mo and my bills without counting food, gas, or recreation come out to 1950/mo. So working full-time I am already in the red.I currently work full-time 830am-530pm. However, my boss is Orthodox Jewish and while we get all the Jewish Holidays off of work, we also don't get paid for them. That means in October I will lose an entire week and two days worth of pay (Oct. 3,4,12,17,18,24,25).I am pregnant and Due the beginning of November. If I take maternity leave I will miss another 1 or 2 weeks (because that's all I feel like I can take) of pay.But that's not all. When the baby does come even if I take two weeks off. No daycare will watch a newborn until they are 6 weeks old. So I have to find the money to pay for someone to watch her for an additional 4-5 weeks. Then when she starts daycare (which I pay out of pocket), my daycare bill will double.My two year old will also turn 3 in November and Christmas is coming up. At this point I can't afford presents for either, which is horrible. I want to buy her gifts and give her the celebration she deserves, but I also want the lights and heat to stay on.Now I will address a few questions I expect there will be....Where is my daughters father? Where is the father of this new life coming?Liljas father hasn't been in our lives since he pushed me down a hill toward a river when I was pregnant with her. He has never met her, or asked about her. I do not receive child support from him because according to my lawyer, if he pays the support he has visitation rights to her and it is not safe for him to be around her. So rather than collect the small fee every month I should be, I'm guaranteeing my child's safety.Lilja knows my ex-boyfriend as daddy. He was there through my pregnancy with Lilja. Went to my appointments, cut Liljas chord when she was born, watched her when I needed someone, took her out, went to doctor appointments with her. He is for all intents and purposes her father. We have been together ever since. Until I found out I was expecting. After 4 years with whom I thought was the one he dropped a huge betrayal on my head. The day I told him I was pregnant was the day he told me he had started seeing someone else. Not only that but I learned that he had been leading a double life. One with me and one with everyone else. His family had no idea he was still seeing me. The friends that knew me were apparently friends that he didn't hang out with much. When I spoke with his parents they demanded proof that I had been apart of his life for years. How could someone who I spent every week with, who went to my family functions, who I took trips with, who has a billion pictures with myself and my daughter, someone who was at my grandmothers funeral and basically lived with me keep me such a secret. How could I have been so blind as to not know it? He has since declared wanting nothing to do with his child because a child would mess up his plans. I plan on filing for child support when the baby comes.Both of my children will have my last name.Just because I work full time doesn't mean I work hard enough to ask others for money.I am also a full time student at UMBC finishing up my Bachelors in Social Work. I already hold an Associates in Business Administration whichI got in one year instead of two.My day to day is to wake up at 630. Leave by 745. Drop my daughter off at daycare and get to work by 830. I leave work at 530. Go to classes until 10PM. I pick up my daughter from my brother who watches her after daycare. I come home. I do house work. Put her to bed and hopefully am in bed by 11PM. On days I do not have class. I pick my daughter up from daycare. Run errands (food shopping, laundry). Make dinner. Play an educational game with my daughter and put her to bed and get to bed around ten.I have been so exhausted on Saturdays that I've often gotten sick and most of the time stay inside and try to rest. On Sundays I try to do something fun for Lilja. Take her to the park, to see grandma and poppy, or make the day fun in some sort of cheap way (baking cookies, doing arts and crafts).I am not entitled. I am not lazy. I am not stupid. I've been dealt an unfortunate hand and I have played my cards to the best of my ability for as long as I can. If you think my financial life is a wreck,Imagine how I am holding up emotionally.Another reason why I am so financially behind. Is because this pregnancy has not been an easy one. I got really sick and was in and out of the hospital for the entire first trimester. I missed a lot of work and lost my last job because of it. I did not work for 3 months due to hospitalizations and paid my bills using my entire savings account and maxing out my credit card. I found this job as quickly as I could as soon as I was able to work, but I have not been able to begin saving again because even working full time my account is in the red.I will continue to work and got to school and provide the best life I can for my girls because they are the most important things in the world to me.My friends and family have helped me from time to time. But this winter is a situation where I can't just ask for $100 or $200. I will need a minimum of $3500 on top of what I will already make to come out in the green. My real goal is $5000 because I also need care for my newborn daughter after I take maternity leave if I can afford to take maternity leave.With your help, I will be able to afford to take maternity leave from work. I will be able to be there for my newborn and my child during the time of the year they need me the most. Nothing in this world means more to me than my children. I am doing my best on my own and I'm embarrassed to ask for help from strangers, but this winter I'll be extremely harsh and extremely cold if I don't.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Whether you contribute or not, the time and effort spent is very much appreciated.

HELP THESE KIDS COME HOME!!!!,$25 ,$500 ,Family," July 4, 2016",1,2,TUSCALOOSA,AL,149000,,3,"

TUSCALOOSA, AL                                





                        These beautiful children along with their now 4 month old baby brother were put into foster care back in February because of a bad living situation with family . The only thing stopping their mom from bringing them home is having a stable home to bring them to. Door after door has been shut on her for getting into a place, some because of the size of the family, some because of not so great credit. At the the end of the day though it all comes down to the up front money required to pay a deposit and first months rent and turn on utilities all at one time. Let's raise the money to help her get into a place so she can bring her babies home and reunite this family!!!!!

Our family is really in need of help financially. We aren't the type to ask for help..We work hard to manage our family's needs. We're in a desperate need of things for baby Axel & could really use a helping hand in this time of our struggle. Anything would be very much appreciated. May God Bless you & those around you! Thank you.
