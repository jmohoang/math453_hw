                                                Good Day To All!I badly need your help! I'm trying to raise funds to acquire and rehabilitate either the Historically Black St.Paul's College in Lawrenceville Virginia, or the Chamberlain-Hunt Academy in Port Gibson Mississippi, with the expressed intent of transforming one or both of them into the Frederick Douglass & Marcus Garvey RBG International Leadership Academy for Black Boys; which will be America's firstprivateK-12 residential academy for African-American males based upon the principles of Traditional Afrikan Culture, Pan-Afrikan Leadership, Community Self-Determination & Cooperative Entreprenuership. As a School Psychologist, School Principal, and Doctor of Clinical Psychology, with more than 20 years of experience servicing African-American boys, I am committed to reversing and ending the detrimental effects of special education, juvenile incarceration, societal alienation, psychological frustration, and premature extermination that has become commonplace for boys of color in this country. Like myself, I'm sure that you are also tired of the suspensions, expulsions, mis-diagnoses, and excessive use of medication and physical force against our boys. The FDMG Academy will chiefly provide our boys with serious Manhood Training and Discipline, which will enable them to return to their communities as leaders, husbands and fathers. Our Agricultural Science and S.T.E.M. (Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics)Program will focus upon raising up the next generation of scientists akin to Dr. George Washington Carver (who once visited St.Paul's College) & Dr. Lewis Latimer. Our Financial and Economic Sciences program will teach them the power techniques of the Real Estate and Commodities Industries; as well as Strategic Business Planning. In addition to several other programs, too numerous to name here, there will be a Seafood & ShellFish Gaming and Business Program that teaches our young men the art of fishing & shipping within the seafood market. All of our academic and industrial programs will prepare our children for college, or immediate business entreprenuership, whichever they personally prefer. A comprehensive Pan-Afrikan History and Culture curriculum will ensure that our children know from whence they came, that we as a people existed before the rise of racism and slavery, with critical attention being paid to the role of African culture with regard to maintaining the health and happiness for everyone within our communities.If you would like to help me reverse the Infamous School-To-Prison Pipeline then please donate to this most worthy of causes, and then influence and motivate everyone you know to do the same! We have to act now, there is no tomorrow unless we make one! $4,000,000 will give us the monies necessary to not only acquire the facilities ($2,000,000), but will also allow us to make the much needed repairs to bring either property up to inspection code, which will be critically necessary towards opening the school as quickly as possible.Your Humble Servant,Dr.Umar Johnson, Psy.D, CSP, M.Ed.Doctor of Clinical PsychologyCertified School Psychologist & PrincipalNational Movement to Save Black BoysKinsman to Frederick DouglassDrUmarJohnson.Com""It Is Easier to Build Strong Children Than To Repair Broken Men.""

                        Our beautiful son Joshua Nicholas White took his own life last Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. Josh worked at Ski Bowl on Mt. Hood as a ride equipment operator and repairman. He enjoyed his job and felt like he was part of a community there. However, he struggled with depression and, obviously, has now lost. Among many loved ones, perhaps the most tragic loss will be felt by his innocent 5 year old daughter, Melanie Noel. As her grandparents, we of course, have many worries for her future. Chief among them is her ability go to college. The world is changing ever faster, and higher education is even more vital. Frankly, it's hared to succeed without it. These funds will be placed in an Oregon College Savings account to be used when Melanie is of age.Thank you in advance for any donation you feel is within your heart and power to give.

                        Hi,My name is Jorge Cabrera and I am a teacher at High Tech High International. I am creating this gofundme account in order to raise money for college day.College day is a really important day not only for our schools, but also for our students. Many of our students are low income and never actually get to visit a college before they apply. In fact, most students will not apply to a college because they never got the chance to visit. Every year my goal is to take students outside of San Diego because we can and will visit schools in the area at any time. Most of our students never even get the chance to leave San Diego on a vacation, much less to visit colleges.This year most of our seniors in my advisory would like to attend Oregon University. The cost for us to go will be $500 a person. As I mentioned before, this is a large amount to ask from families. I would love take my advisory and my seniors here on a lifetime experience and give them the opportunity to visit the college of their dreams as well to get the opportunity to travel with the advisory. My advisory would be forever greatful for any donations made. Please help us make this trip a reality. Our low income families do not have the opportunity to take thier children to visit a variety of collegues. The more we spread awareness about college importance, the more likely the student will apply and go. Thank you,Jorge Cabrera

                        L.A. Times article:  http://lat.ms/29AbnfOThere are few moments in life that are a powerful as witnessing folks from all walks of life uniting for social justice. The power of the people is truly awe inspiring!Since the article went online a few days ago, tho outpuring of support for Gaspar has been tremendous. We could not be more proud of this young man for being such an exemplary student and ambassador for undocumented students; a demographic that is all too often vilified and misrepresented in the media.Together with Gaspar, we will be setting up a college/ savings account that will be used for him to advance his education and supplement his income. Although Gaspar wants to continue working, he hopes it can now be on a weekend-only basis so that he can focus full time on his studies and maybe even one of the internships offered to him. Hewill also be launching a seperate Facebook page for everyone to follow his progress and continue providing him such invaluable moral support.Gaspars's work ethic is only rivaled by his generosity. His forgoing of food from the school pantry so that someone that needed it more could be fed is but one of the many examples of his selflessness and moral compass. At Gaspar's request, 50% of the money raised will go towards assisting some of his classmates at Belmont and Casa Libre get a leg up in order to be able to focus on their studies. This will mean securing representation to address their immediate legal needs and eligibility for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS), asylum, and other forms of immigration relief. We will also be providing scholarships for recent graduates of Casa Libre (and friends of Gaspar) that have continued on to places like Cal Arts, Humboldt State, San Francisco State, and CSUN. Every dollar pledged will go directly to providing invaluable assistance for our unaccompanied students who are leading by example.It really takes a village and we are honored that you have all decided to to become part of ours. Although we do not shy away from taking our message to the streets, we know that another equally powerful tool at our disposal is our example. As our students receive the empowerment and support necessary (for any teenager), we will see more college-bound graduates from this demographic changing the perception of who unaccompanied students are and dispelling the myth that they are somehow predisposed to be cheap manual labor.On behalf of Casa Libre, our students, and our entire immigrant community, I would like to extend our deepest gratitude to all of you for your generosity and support. One of the biggest hurdles for our students to overcome is the feeling of being completely alone in a city that can be as unforgiving as Los Angeles. Having the entire city, and many others across the nation stand with Gaspar and unaccompanied students like him really helps to recognize and validate their efforts. Mil Gracias y SIJS se puede!Sincerely,Federico Bustamante

"Loring School Irish Dance Team,"$2,080","$3,500",Education," September 21, 2016",33,3,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,345000,,,"

MINNEAPOLIS, MN                                





                        ""I like our Irish Dance team because we are like a rainbow!"" Maaliyah remarked as she watched a more typical dance team full of Irish heritage. My dancers are first-generation Americans from Mexico, Somalia, Thailand, Laos and Cote d'Ivoire. They are African-American and Caucasian. They are mixed race children. Many are from high-poverty homes and dangerous neighborhoods where they are afraid to ride their bikes. They spend a lot of time indoors.I have the privilege of being their Language Arts teacher at my urban Minneapolis elementary school. I started Irish dance when I was 38 (!) and fell in love with it. I showed my students a few moves, and five years later, we are a full-fledged team of hugely diverse 4th and 5th graders. These kids are enthusiastic, bright young people who are so excited to learn Irish dance.I have been funding this team on my own salary and by some generous donations from friends for years, and it has grown so much that I'm out of my league. I need help to keep this program running as it has been thus far. The things that I purchased or that were donated are wearing out fast and we are in desparate need of a number of things.UNIFORMS and SHOES:Girls' uniforms: $90 each (socks, bloomers, skirt, shirt, crystals, headband, cuffs) - We need about 20 more of these.Boys' uniforms: $95 each (socks, trousers, dress shirt, tie) - We need about 10 more of these.Girls' Shoes - $45 each for soft shoes - We need about 35 of these.Boys' Shoes - $30 each - We need about 10 of these.BUSES:We need buses for two different trips. Each trip is about $250 for the bus.The north side of Minneapolis is a community of strong, fiercely loyal residents who struggle with the challenges of poverty, either personally or in close proximity. Some of my studentslive on streets with drive-bys and drugs. Some live in shelters. And then there are some who live a 'typical' middle class life, although the neighborhood remains tough. Some have never worn something that costs as much as these uniforms will cost, and they feel like a million bucks when they put them on.Our team fosters persistance, pride, encouragement, teamwork and confidence in a group of students who may have never felt these things before. It is powerful to watch them grow over the year into confident performers who learn to knit themselves together with others. The cameras and the tissues the parents pull out during their children's performances tell me that they are as proud as I am.We start our practices for this school year in October, so time is short. We are very short on shoes because the ones I've used are worn through. That would be my first priority! It would be incredible to be able to outfit the kids before the first performance in December!If you've read this far, thank you. Your donations will go to a bunch of kids who would greatly appreciate, as would I. Thank you for your consideration.

                        Lawsuit filed to preserve religious exemption!What if someone told you you must administer medicine to your child who is not sick even if it violates your religious tenets and practices?This violation of our constitutional freedom is happening now and is being brought to a new level of intensity in our culture. Most Catholic Bishops in Florida are overreaching their authority and violating the freedom and sacred conscience of the Catholic family with their new policy ofrejectingvaccination religious exemptions lawfully claimedfor children by their parents in diocesan schools. Until now, they have always honored a family's legal claim to vaccination exemption based upon their beliefs and practices. Beginning in the upcoming academic year under the new policy, no family may refuse vaccines and receive a Catholic education for their children. This violates the teachings of the Catholic Faith and the sacred bond of the family. It is also a clear violation of the laws of the State of Florida (FL statute 1003.22)These are our children! They do not belong to the bishops! This is our faith and contrary to what many may believe, our faith does not belong to the bishops either.After exhausting appeals to reason, we are having to confront this violation of the family and Florida statutes in a court of law.Please help us bear the mounting financial burden of this effort to preserve our freedoms and demand the Catholic bishops obey the law.

CHICAGO, IL                                




Share this campaign to Facebook to help Farragut Career Academy get Chromebooks!Farragut Career Academy is one of 9 schools using GoFundMe to help provide Chromebooks for their students as a part of the GoFundMe Chromebook Challenge. Until March 22nd, we are competing to see which school can get the most Facebook shares from this GoFundMe campaign.- The school with the most Facebook shares will receive 100 Chromebooks. -Every dollar donated to this campaign will be used to purchase Chromebooks. GoFundMe will match the first $5,000 donated to this campaign. -Please help spread the word by sharing the campaign to Facebook and donating whatever you can!__________________________________________________________________________________Farragut Career Academy is an IB World School in Southwest Chicago that focuses on a holistic understanding of our students. We serve a primarilyHispanic and African Americancommunity; nearly half of community members are foreign-born, which means that many of our parents dont speak English. In addition, less than a quarter of residents graduated from high school themselves. Many parents work in low-paying factory jobs.* When combined, these factors leave our students with few role models in education and few resources to help them overcome educational barriers. Farraguts story is one of change, overcoming obstacles and giving back. A decade ago, violence within the community poured over into our school building, which led to high absenteeism and low levels of academic achievement within the school. Through the dedication of school staff, community members and students, we have significantly decreased the violence in the school and greatly improved the course and extracurricular activities we offer to students, which has led to increased attendance and test scores, and an overall better learning environment. In an environment where high-achieving students are being drawn to selective-enrollment and charter schools, Farragut is one the few neighborhood schools that continues to show consistent improvement.As an IB World School, we seek to develop students who are open-minded, balanced, and caring inquirers. Weve adopted a holistic understanding of our students that allows time and space for them to engage in personal projects which require them to research issues that are important to them and develop projects that address those issues. In the mathematics classroom, students using technology to discover properties of graphs in Desmos and learn how to analyze and manipulate data in spreadsheets. Science classes require students to create electronic lab reports with graphs and tables. English and social science classes have students researching and writing reports. Technology is essential for enabling our students to develop skills that will prepare them for careers beyond the factory jobs that many of their parents work.While students do have limited access to computer labs at the school, most of those computers are almost a decade old. Startup time can take as long as five minutes and logging into the computers can take another few minutes. Students and teachers are losing valuable instructional minutes and are constantly being frustrated by the slowness of the computers. These old devices are not conducive to helping students with their personal projects. With Chromebooks, however, boot up time is 8 seconds and login time is only a few seconds, making the entire process less than 30 seconds. Students would be able to enhance their personal projects and classroom assignments through the use of Google apps, as well as through digital storytelling. Digital storytelling allows students to show off what they have learned in a creative, digital format through websites, online portfolio, Prezi, Blabberize, animoto, etc. In addition, students would be able to utilize the built in camera to record and integrate videos and interviews into their projects. Both the decreased login time and the ability to utilize Google apps will allow our students more opportunity to gain much needed skills.Building off the momentum of improvement weve seen in recent years, we now seek to increase our students access to technology. Our children deserve the best chance possible at being successful in high school and beyond. Chromebooks will allow students to explore curriculum in new ways and receive individualized tutoring when they struggle. Our world is becoming evermore dependent upon technology, so it is essential that our students have every opportunity to learn the technology skills that will be integral to their future success.Please consider donating to our campaign. We can promise you that an investment in these students will have significant returns as they go on to be adults who are positive contributors to our society. Additionally, whether you donate or not, please share our campaign on Facebook. We can win 100 Chromebooks if our campaign has the most shares, so click the blue button above and share it!Here are a couple more unique aspects of FCA:Culture of student service: Despite the difficult situations our students have to navigate, we are constantly impressed by their aspiration to give back to our community. Each student is required to do 40 hours of service learning over the course of four years at Farragut. This year alone, however, our senior class has completed over 9,766 hours of service learning; On average, thats around 56 hours of service learning per student! They contribute to a food pantry, volunteer to play drum line in local parades, host coat drives, and run fundraisers to end childhood cancer. Peer Jury: Of particular interest is serving fellow students through Peer Jury. When a students behavior has negatively affected the learning environment, our student jury works with that individual to help them rectify the damage done, as an alternative to suspension and detentions. This process helps the offender to understand the consequences of their actions, while the jurors learn communication, leadership and problem solving skills.Step Up and Youth Guidance: Now, when students arrive for their first day of 9th grade, they are amazed at how supportive our teachers are and the amount of resources available to help them navigate the violence that happens outside the school walls. Farragut has developed partnerships with outside organizations that help encourage and support students. StepUp inspires teen girls through mentorship and encourage girls to become confident, college-bound and career-focused. Youth Guidance helps young men navigate difficult circumstances that threaten their future by providing support and develop the social and emotional skills necessary to succeed.Extracurriculars: In addition, many students at Farragut participate in extracurricular programs offered by teachers, Enlace, and After School Matters. Some of the programs include lifeguard, dance, JROTC drumline, robotics club, mosaic, digital arts, and computer refurbishment. Mr. Ontiveros, runs an after school program to refurbish computers that are donated to local businesses and organizations free of charge. Last year, they installed a new computer lab for the local elementary school.Here is a link to our schools website with more information on Farragut Career Academy -  http://www.farragutcareeracademy.org/*Statistics taken from  http://enlacechicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/LV-QofL-Plan_Document.pdf.[Farragut is] full of students with potential. Although the neighborhood around the school is not the best, there still are students that want to be successful and make an impact in this world. Having computers will expand our learning in so many ways. - JoshuaFarragut may be poor, but we as students are rich in knowledge, optimism, and perseverance. -JayleneFarragut is a good school with good students that want to learn. The only thing is since Farragut is in a bad neighborhood we dont get a lot of money, so thats why the school budget is really low. We need help because since we live in the year 2016 most work is done on a computer but we cant if we usually dont have enough access to computers. - Anonymous studentFarragut is full of students who want to change and fight for a better future. With education we hope to have a career and make a decent living, but its difficult to focus on our education when we dont have whats needed to learn and become better learners. With new Chromebooks itll help students improve with the technology and visualizations. Itll help us learn and understand things faster. It will also teach us new skills and techniques that we can use later in life. - JoelI remember being in the Technology Club in elementary school and learning how to animate objects. Growing up I had opportunities to learn so much about technology that has helped me even in my career as a teacher. Because of the impact it had on me, I strive to give my students as many opportunities as possible, participating in hour of code so they can learning about computer programming, creating discovery activities so that students can explore mathematics and understand it better, and assigning projects that allow students to work with formulas in Google Spreadsheets. Most of my students have not seen others go on to college and especially not in fields in math and science. If we want the best chances possible for these students, we have to give them opportunities to learn about and explore different fields. Having access to up-to-date technology is of utmost importance in providing these opportunities. Many of these students are stuck in a cycle of poverty and we need to do all we can to help them break that cycle through an engaging education that will lead to a future professional career. -Mrs. Amanda Babb, Math Teacher

Teen Council members make positive and impactful contributions by dedicating hundreds of hours to making our community better by educating where there is a need and advocating for reproductive justice.This summer, Planned Parenthood of Montana has a unique opportunity to send Billings Teen Council members to Washington D.C. to participate in a national convention that will build and strengthen their skills as a Teen Council member. They will meet other Teen Council members from all over the country, lobby legislators, advocate on the behalf of Planned Parenthood, and participate in workshops designed to expand their experience as Teen Council members. We are asking for your help to get them there. Your non-charitable donation will help cover some of the costs of sending Billings Teen Council members to the Lift as We Climb: 2016 Teen Council Summit.Any contribution you can make is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support of our young people who will make a difference!

                                                We have recently been accepted to join an amazing group of young women and future leaders in the At The Well Leadership Academy, which will take place this summer of 2016.But we need your help! Let's start off with an introduction. My name is Jaydah and I am an11th grade student and I've been accepted to the Leadership Academy at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, PA.Through this program I will be attending a twelve-day residential program. I will meet other young women from all over the world to develop our leadership skills and prepare for academic success in college. My sister, Jesenia, a 9th grade student, was accepted to the 9th Grade Intensive Weekend at Princeton University in Princeton, NJ. She will attend sessions that will focus on academic achievement, prepare for standardized tests needed to enter into college and participate in opportunities for community service.When we first heard about the programs, we were excited. With the help of some family members we were able to pay our application fees and take the first step in this journey. We crossed our fingers and prayed for good news. We were extremely excited when we received our letters of acceptance. After all the struggles each of us have experienced in school we never thought we would actually get accepted. We both felt like being accepted was a great accomplishment. But, with the great excitement, came an overwhelming question.HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS? You see, our mom is a single parent of four and lets just say there have been some challenges. She has done a great job with us, at least we think so, but the tuition that is needed to participate in this program is more than she can handle. This will be our first leadership experience and is only a stepping stone to our future. We would be extremely grateful if you were willing to help us fulfill our goal of attending the 2016 At The Well Leadership Academy.Our goal is to raise the total amount of the tuition and submit it to the At The Well by June 1, 2016. Below is an excerpt from the At The Well website:At The Well Leadership Academy seeks to empower young women locally to become effective leaders globally. By promoting excellence in education, young talent will transform their communities. Theyencourage girls to live beyond their limitations, achieve beyond their dreams, and impact communities beyond their reach. You can find more information at http://atthewellconferences.org

Please Help Send This Great Team of 11 Year Olds From Hooksett, NH to the Destination Imagination Global Finals!After coming in First Place in our Regional Tournament, and Second Place in our State Tournament, we're the first team in twelve years from Hooksett to make it to the Global Finals!But, to get there, our team needs to raise about $25,000 to pay for plane tickets, meal plans, rooms, and more. We need your help! If you're able, we're asking you to please make a donation to help us get to Tennessee. Every little bit helps.What is Destination Imagination (DI)?Destination Imagination is an educational organization that gives students the chance to learn and experience the creative process from imagination to innovation, by teaching participants the essential skills of creativity, teamwork, and problem solving.DI's main program is a global problem solving tournament that begins with the fall school semester each year. Elementary, middle, and high school students form teams of up to seven members, and each team selects one of seven mind-bending Challenges created by Destination Imagination volunteers. With the guidance of a teacher or parent as Team Manager, each team creates an action plan and works together for weeks or months to develop and create a solution to the Challenge. From the U.S to China, Poland, Colombia and Brazil, student creativity is unleashed in astonishing ways in the Destination Imagination program. Each year, 1,000 or more teams advancing from regional, state, and country-level tournaments have the opportunity to compete at Destination Imagination's Global tournament held in May at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.First, teams compete in the regional tournament, and the top two teams in your level doing your challenge will advance to the state competition. Then, the top two teams in the state finals will advance to the global competition in Knoxville, Tennessee.How Did We Get Here?Our challenge, The Tension Builds, was a structural challenge in which we were required to build a structure and see how much weight it could support. We also had to perform a play up to eight minutes long and incorporate our structure into it. Everything needed to be done by the team, and we couldn't get any help at all from our parents or teachers.Since our challenge was called The Tension Builds, we had to incorporate tension into our play. Our play was about three genies who get into a fight, which causes three wishes granted to scientists to go wrong. The first wish was to have a robot help build a structure, but the robot won't stop dancing. The second wish was to go the the biggest fast food restaurant in the world, and while the scientist is there, the waiters drop all of his food and blame each other for the accident. The third wish was to go to a World Series game, but one of the scientists gets hit in the head with a baseball, and ends up with a concussion. The genies heal the scientist who was hurt, and then all come together and make up, and fix everything that went wrong. The tension is resolved, and everyone is happy.We also had to build a structure using only wood, glue, and fishing line. The structure needed to be lightweight and fit within specified dimensions given to us by DI. During the competition, we stacked weights on top of our structure to see how much it could hold. Our little structure was able to hold 260lbs!In our regional tournament the top two teams advance. We came in first place in our age level, so we advanced to the state finals along with the second place team. In states, the rules are the same (top two move on), and we tied for second! In fact, we missed winning by only 4 points, with the first place team scoring 327 while we scored 323. Second place in the state still allows us to join all of the other top teams from 45 US states and 14 different countries, May 21-24 in Knoxville, Tennessee for our Global tournament! But we need your help! Any support you can offer is greatly appreciated!Thank you!

Abdullhi has scholarships for only his first two years of college (from a small college in Pennsylvania and several small scholarships based in Seattle). He did really well in his freshman year (2014-15), getting a B average. This is amazing given that he grew up in a violent and unstable refugee camp in Kenya. He had to learn to read, write, and speak English and to navigate American culture in a few short years before tackling an American high school. His family is very supportive and really big (7 living siblings), but they live in a housing project on two intermittent part time salaries. Weraiseed $6000 for books and the rest of his tuition this year. (This doesn't include toothpaste and laundry soap!) Where will the next two years come from?He is consideringbecoming a physical education teacher, so he can help the younger kids in his housing project get the same opportunity he has managed. He's been a great coach for the little ones over the years. He is also considering a career helping youth involved in the criminal justice system. Would you be willing to donate $50 to $100 to help this smart, charming, bundle of energy make it through another year of college? He's going to need a few donations of $500 if this is going to work. If he is someone you would like to support, please send the link on to others of like mind. And anything will help!Here are some of Abdullahi's words from his college application: ""A refugee camp is more horrible than the worst ghetto in the United States. I know going to college is going to be really difficult for me, but because of all the things Ive experienced in my life, I know I will be successful. In the refugee camp, every single night it was terrible for my family because we were scared to get shot or robbed. The people who lived outside around the camp robbed, killed, and did whatever they wanted to do. They had guns. We bought our meat from them such as goats, chickens, camels, and cows. Whenever we had weddings, family reunions, and funerals, we bought their animals for food. They used to sell to us in the morning, and at night, they came with their guns and got their animals back. ""September 15, 2003 is a day Ill never forget because those people entered my Uncle Ahmeds house to rob him. When he heard their steps, he grabbed a big stick and turned off the lantern. He waited until they came half way inside the house. Then he swung his big stick, and they shot him in the liver. There was blood everywhere. Tears were dripping like a rain. Everyone in the neighborhood got up from their sleep when they heard the gun shot. Lots of people came to my uncles house, saw the damage and started crying. Watching my uncle get rushed to the hospital with lots of blood on his body is one of the worst things I have ever seen. Every now and then that moment pops right back into my mind and tears start coming out of my eyes. ""At the age of eight I had a job. In the camp, we didnt have flushing toilets. We used to dig a hole as deep as a two story building. My job was to dig some of the hole and carry the sand to the lake. I used to do that just to get a meal.  ""My first day in an American school, I was really scared about how I was going to make it back home safe. It felt like a new world. It was also really hard for me to understand what the teachers were saying because I barely spoke the language. I stayed after school everyday for two to three hours studying, reading, writing, and speaking. I thought coming to America would make my life easier, but it made it harder. ""In high school, I played for the best team in the city. It was really difficult for me to get to practices and get all my work done. All my teammates had parents or teammates who could drive them to practice and back home, but I caught the bus every day after I finish my work at school.  ""Experiencing the things that happened in the refugee camp and the US has helped me not to give up when I am going through challenging things in my life. It doesnt matter how many times life knocks me down. What matters is how many times I can get back up and do what I believe in. I know going to college is going to be really difficult, but I know I will be prepared for everything. No one in my family has ever been to college, and I want to change that pattern. I want to be the first one in the Abdi family to go to college.  ""My whole family never had the chance to work with knowledge. The only work they could do is physical things with their hands. The kind of work all my family had was a job to earn money. Ive never heard them saying positive things about their jobs. I want to get the job that I enjoy and not because of the money. I want to go to a job not because I have to but because I want to.  ""I live in a housing project, and its a really poor neighborhood. We have lots of athletes that dont have the little helps they need to make the next step forward. I played almost every sport when I was in middle school, and I have connections with my coaches. When the kids came up to me and asked for help, I helped them. Whenever they had problems that I wouldnt be able to help them with, I called my coaches to ask them for help. They gave me the solution to solve their athletic problems, and we kept moving forward. The reason why kids in my neighborhood take sports seriously is because thats the best way to go to college. We dont have any money to go to college, so we need as many scholarships as possible. I love helping because I believe that the more we help people the more help we get. I want more kids from the housing project going to university. Being a PE teacher will help with that."" Whatever career path he decides to take, you can be sure his life will be dedicated to helping young people. No one should have to muster the amount of couragethis lad has just to attend college.Lycoming Alumni should not contribute to this fund as that is an NCAA violation.#GFMScholarship

"Miriam's Legacy - School for kids,"$3,586","$10,000",Education," September 21, 2016",32,4,CONCORD,NH,154000,,1,"






                            Miriam Watson
                            
                            
                                                           
CONCORD, NH                                




Miriam Watson, wife of Bill Watson and parents of Anabelle and Gregory, passed away on September 18, 2016.


For those that knew Miriam, her kids Anabelle and Gregory were her world. After years of fertility issues Bill and Miriam were so lucky just to have them. 


While pregnant with Gregory, Miriam was diagnosed with breast cancer. If not for the diagnosis during pregnancy, doctors were confident Miriam's cancer would have killed her without warning. 


Over the next 11 years Miriam successfully battled cancer, raised, coached, mentored and inspired the kids, Bill, and so many others throughout the greater Concord community. 


She instilled values and beliefs that they will take the kids through their lives with amazing success. 


Miriam homeschooled the kids right up until the day she died. Gregory is now in 6th grade and Anabelle in 8th. Her plan was to go as long as possible with schooling the kids herself.  


With her passing, she asked Bill simply to make sure that the kids received the best education possible. Bill doesn't believe he could ever possibly do justice on his own, so is looking to choose the best school available locally. 


This campaign is simply to make every effort to honor her request to give the kids the best education possible, with similar values and beliefs to her own. 


It isn't anticipated that the goal will be met but it represents almost the amount required for one year of our chosen school for the kids.

"Sara's fund for graduate school,$530,"$6,000",Education," September 23, 2016",21,1,LONG BEACH,CA,74000,,,"






                            Sara Castro
                            
                            
                                                           
LONG BEACH, CA                                





                        My name is Sara Castro. I am an undergraduate senior at California State University, Long Beach, where I am studying psychology and linguistics. I am raising money through the#GFMScholarship campaign to help me pay for my undergraduate loans and for my future career as a graduate student. I will use this funds and scholarship to continue my education. I am planning on enrolling in a master's program in order to gain research experience and help me prepare for a doctorate program in the future.I was born and raised in Mexico City. I grew up in a loving and caring family and surrounded by wonderful friends. In 2010, I had to move to the United States. It was a very difficult time for me, as I was leaving behind all the people I knew and everything I loved. I struggled greatly; I did not embrace these changes and I experienced much anxiety and depression. At the same time, I also suffered from an eating disorder and I had to be enrolled in an inpatient treatment facility.Going through with the treatment was one of the most difficult experiences of my life. However, I slowly felt my mind and body become healthy again, and my life finally started improving. I learned so much about myself and I learned to cope with my emotions. It was during this time I became passionate about psychology. I was a witness to the positive influence of psychological research, and I knew then I wanted to study and understand the human mind.I finished high school a few months later with the title of Valedictorian, and I began attending community college right after. I was such a happy and motivated person, I got As in all my classes, got my driver's license, and started working at my first job that semester.In the three years at community college, my life had turned around completely. I graduated with honors and two associate degrees, I had wonderful friends, and I was ready to transfer to Cal State Long Beach and continue pursuing my dreams.Today, I am ready to graduate from this university. My time here has been incredible, and, in the few months I have been here, I have already accomplished so many great things. I am a PRO Guide in the Psychology Resource Office, where we provide resources to students, including information on graduate school, careers, and volunteering opportunities. I am participating in the University Honors Program, which has allowed me to work closely with a faculty advisor in the process of writing a senior thesis. I am working at the Writer's Resource Lab as a tutor, a job I absolutely adore. I am also a board member for our Psychology Student Association and Psi Chi Honor Society joint club, where we provide opportunities for psychology students to connect, network, and make new friends, as well as learn more about the field of psychology. This semester, I also started volunteering as a research assistant, where I will work closely with a graduate student and a faculty member in understanding eating behavior in rat models.As I get ready to leave behind my undergraduate years, I am asking for financial assistance in the next step of my career. In the next few months, I will be applying to some master's programs and a few doctoral programs that focus on research and the human brain. I currently work only 13 hours a week, and I have been paying for my college tuition with the help of loans. The money I raise from this campaign will help me start paying my undergraduate loans, as well as my graduate school applications. I will save portion of that fund to help me pay for graduate school in the future. I will use it for any traveling costs, rent, and college books.I need these funds as soon as possible, since graduate school applications begin next month. Any help is truly appreciated and will make an enormous difference as I go through this next step in my life. Obtaining a college degree was something I could have never even dreamed of a few short years ago. I want to dedicate my life doing research and empowering people through education. Going to graduate school means that I will continue learning the skills and gaining the experience I need to be able to give back to society. I am so thankful for the opportunity to live in a country that supports its students and allows people to learn, grow, and give back to the community. This opportunity means the whole world to me, and I cannot even begin to express how much I will appreciate any contributions. I hope my story and experiences reflect positively on my character and qualities, and I also hope this shows how motivated and encouraged I am to pursue and succeed in graduate school. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and help me achieve my career goals and continue my academic journey.

Until March 22nd, we are competing to see which school can get the most Facebook shares from this GoFundMe campaign.

- The school with the most Facebook shares will receive 100 Chromebooks.- Every dollar donated to this campaign will be used to purchase Chromebooks. GoFundMe will match the first $5,000 donated to this campaign.- Please help spread the word by sharing the campaign to Facebook or donating whatever you can!__________________________________________________________________________________San Francisco International High School might just be one of the most unique schools in the country. While other schools are diverse, SFIHS is made up entirely of recent immigrants to the US - a full 30% of our kids come here unaccompanied by family. 98% are eligible for free and reduced lunch. Approximately 35% come to us with interrupted formal education having been in refugee camps, detention centers, or coming from countries that were not able to offer regular schooling. The different life and educational experiences of our students makes us a uniquely heterogeneous school.We view the use of technology as an important way for our diverse students to learn to collaborate and prepare them for higher education. Many of our students are supporting themselves and their families and work full time to be able to afford the high cost of living in San Francisco. Through this, we find that they remain a remarkably motivated and resilient group of young people.I dont know about you, but I dont think that at 15, I could have navigated detention facilities and shelters, enrolled in school, secured full time work, supported myself financially, and still shown up for my education everyday. - Principal JulieOur mission is to give our students a close-knit and supportive community where differences are cherished, and academic and college success is a given. The school was founded in 2009, and has significantly higher graduation and college going rates than English Learners in other places. Our students are strong, and are capable of the highest levels of academic success when given the support they need. This includes access to technology and Chromebooks!Currently, our school has 1 computer lab with 30 computers, which holds ourstudents back from collaborating on Google Docs and PowerPoints for projects. For example, when peer editing each other's personal statements for college, we ask them to read and comment on each other's work, but this cannot happen if there are not enough computers for students to use.Having the Chromebooks would allow our students to have access to technology every day, not just when their teacher can reserve the lab. It would also give them enough time with technology to be prepared to collaborate in college and career. While the school may be poor in resources, we are rich in language, culture, and love for our students. Please donate or share this GoFundMe campaign on Facebook to give our students access to Chromebooks so that they can achieve and learn more than ever before!(Here is a link to our schools website with more information on San Francisco International High School-  https://international-sfusd-ca.schoolloop.com/)

                        Lampist, caterer, potter, writer, master-adhesivist, theater advocate, board member, master mind, pseudo socialite, faux-celebrity, designer, grassroots elitist, and frippery obsessed.  These are Rob Kennedy's own wordshe used to describe himself on his website for his lamp company, Coalition Society. While his words give a small insight into Rob's persona, all of us who knew and loved Rob know that he defied description, definition or delineation (how can you adequately describe someone who believed that hedidn't grow up in this world, but rather ""fell from the stars?"") Looking at the legacy of work Robleaves behind provides another perspectiveinto the complex mind of acreative genius.  While one of his life's goals was tomake the world a better place through better lighting by designing beautiful, timeless lamps, he was also fiercely passionate about his love of ceramics. Rob studied ceramics during his undergraduate yearsat the University of Michigan and during his pursuit of his Masters of Fine Arts at the University of South Carolina. A natural ""ceramist"", he rapidlydeveloped from a novice into a true master, confidentlydisplaying in his work technical proficiency combined with a flair for the dramatic and whimsical.One of Rob's greatest joys was being asked to returnfor a week in April 2016as a visiting professor (with Edu as his trusty teaching assistant) to the University of South Carolina by his beloved ceramics professor Virginia Scotchie where he gave her students a wide-ranging presentation on his life as a working artist, showcasing his beautiful lamp creations, his diverse body of work in ceramics and his impeccable design esthetic. He was thrilled to conduct private critiques with Virginia'sstudents in the ceramics program, providing pointed, helpful and, in some cases, his patented other-worldly perspective on their body of work. He loved every minute of it and planned to return next year.To honor his life as an artist and as an outward symbol of the inner joy his life brought to all those he touched, his family and close friends are in the process of establishing a scholarship in his name at the University of South Carolina to be awarded to students who exhibit outstanding achievement in the undergraduate and graduate programs focusing on ceramics. The Rob Kennedy Scholarship will be in perpetuity at USC, so young, impressionable and unsuspecting ceramic students will always know who this fabulous and fashionable free-spirit was who lived his life in the neverending pursuit of inventing and producing ""uber-elegant and glamorous"" designs. Please know that the scholarship WILLhappen, regardless of the amount of money collected through this gofundme page.Please consider contributing toward the Rob Kennedy Scholarship through this gofundme page. All funds received will be forwarded to the University of South Carolina for contribution toward establishing the endowment for Rob's scholarship. Alternatively, direct contributions may be made tothe USC Educational Foundation, which is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) entity to which contributions are tax-deductible, which will hold these contributions and credit them to Rob's scholarship fund once it is up and running.

The program is 20 months old, has 122 cadetsand runs all year long. It has one Senior Military Instructor (SMI) that teaches 4 academic classes daily, as well as conductsall before and after school programs for the cadets,The instructor also oversees the unit's competitions, public appearances and community service events.    The contract with the Marine Corps has stated from the beginning that after 75 cadets, a second instructor is required. The program has grown quicker than expected or budgeted for. At this point in time, the school does not have a second instructor in the budget, so we are trying to help raise the necessary funds to become in compliance.    The program started as a club in 2013 with 30 cadets. It grew to a full academic program in 2014 with 93 cadets. The collaborationof hard work and dedication of the SMI, school staff and parent volunteers has madeit becomeverysuccessful.The cadets are learning life skills they do not get elsewhere  some examples are teamwork, self-confidence, and giving back to the community. The cadets recently competed in the Joint Service Grand Nationals, which is a diverse competition for cadet units nationwide. The AV MC JROTC brought home 5 awards! We need your help!!      TheMarine Corpshas advised the unit of the requirement of the second instructor and the possibility of probation, which could result in losing the program.The school does not have the funds for the position; we needto raise $100,000 to be ableto hire an instructor.

For those of you that don't already know I was involved in a motorcycle accident June 20, 2015 which left my left upper body paralyzed. I sustained 3 fractured vertebra and a brachial plexus injury where 5 of my nerves were either yanked out of their sockets or ruptured throughout my brachial plexus. Fast forward to present time where I'm currently using fitness as one of my biggest tools to staying positive along with helping others by showing what we're really capable despite in difference society might deem a disability. I haven't worked since my accident and I am still fighting for disability of some kind. I will be traveling to Dallas, Texas to train out of the Adaptive Training Foundation for 9 weeks. My first competition is October 29th in College Park, Maryland. I will need help to fund these trips in the amount of my goal which I've looked up prices and estimated living expenses. My end goal for this part of my journey is to learn all that I can so that no matter where I end up I will have gained that much more knowledge to not only improve my quality of life but that of everyone else around me as well.

In addition to increasing the graduation rate by nine percentage points, (61%-70%!), our test scores and overall school culture have greatly improved. 100% of our graduating seniors in 2015 applied to post secondary school. After many years of being an F school, TC Howe raised its grade for the first time in 2015 and continues to improve. As we continue on our journey toward greatness, we have set our sights on academic, social and physical excellence for all students. Chromebooks will be an important addition that will help us reach our goals. Our goal is to allow every student personal access to a Chromebook to help prepare our students for real-world success. A Chromebook in the hands of each student will serve as an excellent complement to the technology CSUSA has already invested in our school. With Chromebooks, we can implement flipped classrooms where students can watch lectures at home to prepare them for classroom participation the following day. This allows for more in class practice and teacher support. We also intend to implement them in conjunction with our partnership with Ivy Tech. We will offer dual credit classes where students can earn high school and college credit at the same time. Chromebooks will be a huge asset to students who are preparing for higher education or those who are embarking on career-readiness programs.Our school promotes a culture of self-discipline and hard work. On any given day, students partner with the United States Army the JROTC program where they learn about leadership and citizenship. A full 25% of our kids participate. You can also see our student-athletes training to make it to the state finals, or our teachers hosting after-school tutoring. Youll also see students participating in after-school activities ranging from cooking classes to chess.Our students, teachers and staff have faced and conquered many challenges, but we still have a long way to go. We are looking forward to a future that before seemed too distant to reach, but now, its within our grasp. Your donation to our Chromebook Campaign will help us continue on our path to greatness. Please donate and share this campaign to Facebook so we can reach our full potential and rising up to be the top school in the state.

"Keoni's Fight to stay in School,,,Education," July 24, 2016",161,2,Oval Ward,ENG,542000,3,9,"






                            Desta Millett
                            
                            
                                                           
Oval Ward, ENG                                





                        We are Desta Millett and Mike Bostock, our son is Keoni. He's seventeen and has complex special needs. His autism is severe. He hasn't spoken in fifteen years. He suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), high levels of anxiety, an eating disorder, Pica and recently began having epileptic seizures. Despite these challenges he's a popular young man with an enthusiasm for life.Aged eight Keoni was excluded from education. No one would have him. He was a tortured soul filled with anxiety which manifested in daily violent tantrums. It was difficult getting through to him. Night times were unpredictable rampages so doors and cupboards were locked to ensure safety. As he grew the violence became more difficult to cope with and we were close to the limit of my our capabilities. We never gave up on the idea of Keoni having the education he deserved. After a long battle where our health suffered, around his tenth birthday we secureda place for Keoniat St Christopher's, Bristol; a specialist residential school.Seven years on Keoni is transformed. Years of patient techniques and therapies mean the violent tantrums are in the past. He's learnt sign language and overcome many anxieties and is calm enough to flourish in the classroom. He ceased manhandling people when feeling anxious, able to convey his discomfort and seek an alternate space without violence. Above all he feels safe and secure enough to participate in his education.Keoni is learning skills to give him independence. He's accomplished much since joining the school. Basic skills we take for granted; learning how to cook, to do his laundry, cleaning his living spaces, managing his personal hygiene, dressing himself, demonstrating an eye for fashion and pride in his appearance.  His carers at school were bold and determined enough to unearth within Keoni a talent for rock climbing that is both transformational and inspiring. After watching her brother eftortlessly climbing a 40ftindoor wall for the first time, his then 3 year old sister Zahra was determined to try it herself.Keoni's a popular member of the community. He's well known at the barbers, cafe's and shops. As a boy just getting him to the newsagent and back was a challenge. We'll never be able to fully convey my gratitude to the care staff, Medical consultants, experts and management team of St Christopher's who've been so devoted to Keoni. They've given our son a chance of a meaningful life. A life we didn't dare dream of.In Jul 2015 St Christopher's scored an inadequate Ofsted rating. Keoni's team reassured us his House was not a contributing factor. Despite this our Local Authority (LA) immediately tried to remove Keoni from St Christopher's. We fought successfully to keep him there from Aug 2015 until Apr 2016. The LA finally confirmed in writing their plan to remove Keoni from St Christopher's with a deadline of Jul 29th 2016. They named a non residential school in South London completely unsuitable for Keoni's needs at which point we had no choice but to employ the services of a Solicitor.To further confuse things Christmas 2015 the school faced the threat of closure due to maladministration and austerity. A campaign spearheaded by parents led to a take over of the school early 2016. The takeover was seamless. The group are experienced with an impressive track record and have reassured us they will not rest until St Christopher's has received an ""Outstanding"" rating from Ofsted. The LA still maintain they wish to remove Keoni due to an inadequate Ofsted rating that was awarded over a year ago. A subsequent OFSTED inspection Autumn 2015 recorded a significant improvement and the school has now been taken over by a group with a proven track record. These elements simply ignored as an ""inconvenient truth"" by the LA.Keoni cannot speak for himself and the LA motivated by austerity are ignoring his needs as well as the directives laid down in ""The Children and Families Act"". Sidelined we were left with no choice but to seek legal representation and appeal the LA's decision. Because of his age Keoni is not entitled to Legal Aid so we have to fund his defence ourselves.Of great concern is that despite our best efforts Keoni has picked up on the disruption. He's already displaying anxiety related behaviours we haven't seen for years. All the behavioural experts we've spoken to predict that the shock of the move would see all the good work of the past seven years unravel in months.We both work but raising money for Keoni's defence is proving to be painfully expensive. The alternative would see Keoni fall through the cracks in the system and the inevitable conclusion is an institution or worse. He warrants so much more and we would appreciate any help that you are prepared to give him. Our humble thanks.Desta and Mike

Needless to say this leaves us in a pretty precarious position. We are currently in negotiation with administration to reinstate at least SOME of our funding and are currently brainstorming potential last resort fundraising opportunities. However, nothing is yet codified. The coaching staff was hoping to tug on your heartstrings in order to motivate you to participate in our GoFundMe campaign!We hope to raise $10,000 which would fund our team activities, tournament entries, travel, and all the (many) essential team management costs.Any and ALL donations are sincerely appreciated.

My name is Alexander andI am a British born Jamaican-Zimbabwean, with a big dream! Last month, I was accepted to my dream school, Bristol Old Vic Theatre School on the 2-year programme in Professional Acting. With thousands of applicants each year, only 14 actors are accepted to the programme. The school offers world class training and boasts alumni such as Sir Patrick Stewart, Pete Postlewaite, Daniel Day Lewis, and Jeremy Irons. Its such a big achievement for myself and my family and will mark the first exciting new step towards my artistic goals.I first started performing during my childhood in Zimbabwe. My friends and I would perform mini sketches and plays for our mothers, at school shows, and on the Harare REPS theatre stage where I was first inspired by watching my aunt perform. When I moved to the UK, drama helped me at a time I was very homesick. I continued performing inschool shows and with my siblings at home in the holidays where wecontinued writing and performing mini sketches for family. At the cross roads at deciding what to do at university, I chose to study psychology as I am fascinated by human behaviour. This has been invaluable to my understanding of the human condition, and I have always been most inspiredby theatre that is as truthful to the human condition as possible. I continued with my passion through joining the Islington Players, where we put on some great shows on the fringe circuit in London. I also trained part time at Identity Drama School, whilst I completed my dissertation.Having already had a student loan, I am unable to get government funding for my training. I have been saving funds whilst working, however still need to raise more for the security of my second year fees.The 2 Year Foundation Degree in Professional Acting at Bristol Old Vic, is an experience that will be invaluable for my development as a professional actor. It is specifically designed for individuals like myself, who already have experience of theatre and the world. I will get the opportunity to work with actors, teachers and writers of the highest standard in an international industry that is screaming out for more diversity. The latter which I am passionate about promoting within the industry through my work. I am under no illusions this will be the most challenging journey I will have faced to date, but its one that I feel I need to undertake.GOALFor the security of my second year at the school, I will be raising funds over the next 3 months. I willdo this through a combination of working (continuing into training and during the holidays), crowdfunding, fundraising events and applying to any grants available for people in my situation. I need to raise 9,000 in total for my second year tuition.MONEYThe money donated will be used for my course fees, as well as course-related costs such as books. If donations happen to exceed this amount, I will refund people.IN RETURNI will be personally thanking every person who supports me and promise gifts for some donations, for example Home-Cooked meals, Helping Round People's Houses, Performances of my Audition Pieces, etc.

One to One Sessions with JOHN BYRNE: Actors, the amazing John Byrne has offered one to one sessions (which usually cost 50) foreach person who donates 25 to my campaign. Let me know you would like to take up this offer and I will put you in touch to arrange the session.John is the Entertainment Industry Career Advisor to The Stage newspaper and Young Performer magazine and has over 30 years of experience as a writer, broadcaster and performer in his own right.

                        Dear friends,We are pleased to announce the launch of the Farm at Bartrams Garden as a neighborhood-based program to support food sovereignty and youth training efforts in the Southwest Philadelphia community. Since its founding in 2012 as the Community Farm and Food Resource Center, the Farm has always been a hub for learning, sharing, and growthnot to mention delicious food! This new chapter promises to be an exciting opportunity for the Farm, and we look forward to sharing this journey with you.Join in the adventure by making a gift today.Last season,powered by 22 paid local high school interns, we produced over12,000 poundsof food, worked alongside45 Southwest familiesin the community garden, provided hands-on education for more than 9,000 schoolchildren through Bartrams Garden programming, distributed over80,000 vegetable transplants through the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS)City Harvest program for more than 130 farms and gardens around Philadelphia, hosted over1,500 volunteers,and held50 affordable weekly farmstands.We are grateful for the support and investment of our partners at the University of Pennsylvania Agatston Urban Nutrition Initiative, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the Philadelphia Orchard Project, and the City of Philadelphias Parks and Recreation Department in establishing the Farm as well as in achieving these milestones over the last five years. Agriculture was a vital part of life at the Bartram homestead in colonial times, and today the Farm provides many valuable opportunities for reconnecting with and building upon this important legacy.The Farms mission includes hands-on opportunities for community members and youth to grow, preserve, and prepare their own food. These efforts range from sharing seedlings to providing community garden plots and tools to hosting cooking and food preparation workshops. We believe in the importance of lifelong learning and mentorship, and the Farm programming includes a special focus on providing our youth with practical skills and helping them develop lifelong habits for good health and self-sufficiency.We enter this new chapter with excitement and ready to dig in further! We envision expanding and deepening our work in food sovereignty, youth empowerment, and community outreach. We seek to develop local and national models that provide tools for organizing for food sovereignty; mentor and empower young people from our community;  support and connect with elders; nurture culturally engaged community gardening; and, of course, increase access to fresh, organic, nutritious food in the historically undeserved parts of our neighborhood. To achieve these goals, we need your support. We are very excited to see the Farm continue to grow, and in order to expand our current programming, we need to raise $30,000 within the next three months. We hope that you will join our many dedicated partners in making this opportunity possible: please use this secure server tomake your tax-deductible gift now. You can learn more about our values and impactand get a behind-the-scenes viewthrough the video above.We sincerely appreciate your support of the Farm and look forward to working with you as we continue to grow.

Aloha nui kkou mai ka l hiki mai i kahikina a i ka welo ana o ka l kaulana o Kne... E!We are Sacred Mauna Kea Hui, an advocacy group, whose goal is to preserve and maintain the supreme sacredness of the summit of Mauna Kea. Its pristine endangered species environment and the main Hawaii Island fresh water aquifer are located a stones throw away from the planned 5000 gallon toxic waste container of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). We are also fighting against our cultural erasure and ethnocide here in Hawaii!WE can't do it without YOU!PLEASE HELP US STOP THE THIRTY METER TELESCOPE (TMT) PROJECT!Mauna Kea is the most sacred place to Hawaiians and one of the most sacred places to the people of Polynesia. Mauna Kea is the first born child of our gods Wkea and Papahnaumoku. Wkea means vast expanse of the heavens, and is our sky father. Papahnaumoku is our earth mother, her name means the foundation (papa) who gave birth (hnau) to our islands (moku) because our islands were created from her body, the earth. The summit of Mauna Kea, the highest point in all of the Pacific, is where Papa and Wkea came together to create our world.The piko, the umbilical cord or center of ones being has tied us as Knaka Maoli to the summit of Mauna Kea for generations. For generations, we have referred to the summit as ka piko kaulana o ka ina (the famous summit of all the land) to describe its sacredness and wonders.Mauna Kea sits on the main aquifer for the island of Hawaii. There are many toxic chemicals including mercury needed for the use of the telescopes; chemicals from other telescopes in place have already leaked into the soil. TMT construction vehicles and equipment have also spilled oil into the ground. The summit is home to rare, endangered species such as the palila bird and the wekiu bug, found nowhere else on earth. The wekiu bugs habitat has already been damaged from the building of the previous 13 telescopes on the summit, and the TMT will damage a much larger area. It will be 18 stories tall, will dig into the ground the equivalent of over two stories of a building, and will cover an area of 8 acres. Current building laws on the island do not even allow a building that tall to be built.There are over 100 sites of worship documented by archaeologists spread across the summit, many of these will be destroyed if construction proceeds. There is our sacred Lake Waiau near the summit, which is associated with the Hawaiian snow goddess Poliahu and a goddess of the mist named Lilinoe. Lake Waiau has been drying up, because previous construction has cracked the soil, causing the sacred waters made of melted snow to slowly leak away. TMT construction will further damage the area, and cause the lake to dry up faster and completely disappear.Visit our knowledge-well at sacredmaunakea.wordpress.com to learn more.We humbly ask the aloha ina everywhere who hold the Mauna sacred:Please come to the summit of the Mauna and support the brave warriors, who are protesting at 9000 feet above sea level, indefinitely.Or... if you can't be physically on the summit of Mauna Kea, please support from where you are!Donations for flights to and from Hawaii between our other Hawaiian islands, as well as accommodation, food, transportation, etc. are needed. Although many selflessly support our hard-working advocates in all ways possible, the cost of fighting a 1.4 billion dollar international conglomerate is a challenge that we gladly meet.As we exhaust our resources, we turn to you, the people of Hawaii and the world, who wish you could help in some way, but as much as you would like to, you can't be on Mauna Kea. This is one way your participation can be profound and meaningful from right where you are!We offer our aloha and this simple video of a song composed for our sacred Goddess, Poliahu, in hopes it will inspire your needed charity.Mahalo.Note on this mele, Hawaiian music composition: ""Poliahu i ke kapu o ke kuahiwi Paa ia puni a ke hauHaulani na ka Wahine Aahu Ua Kea ka mamaneKA PIKO KAULANA O KA AINA!""Poliahu on the sacred mountainSecured by snow all aroundHeavenly snow of the GoddessThe white mist covers the MamaneThe famous summit of all the land...

BATON ROUGE, LA                                




Central Community School System is located in East Baton Rouge Parish and serves 4,500 students. It is home to 5 schools: Central High School, Central Middle School, Central Intermediate School, Tanglewood Elementary School, and Bellingrath Hills Elementary School.In the early morning hours of Friday, August 12, 2016, heavy rains began to fall in the area. Students and employees were told not to report to school. Area homes, schools, churches, and businesses started flooding before mid-morning. As the day turned into evening, the waters continued to rise as more properties saw water rush inside. Schools and churches that were initially set up as temporary shelters on Friday began to take in water, and displaced residents were moved to other schools and shelters in the area. A total of 1,200 displaced citizens were housed at Central Intermediate School and Central Middle School as a result. Many of the young, displaced residents had excitedly entered these halls on the previous Thursday (August 11th) for the First Day of School.As the high waters have started to recede, the tremendous devastation to Central is evident. A large percentage of the student and employee population had flood waters ravage their homes. Tanglewood Elementary School received 2 feet of water during the height of flooding. Less than a week ago, this school saw smiling faces enter wearing new uniforms and carrying backpacks full of school supplies. The Central Office also had water in the building.The money collected through this campaign will allow us to help students and employees get back on their feet as quickly as possible. We would like to help ease the burden of classroom supplies and uniforms for our students and help meet the needs of our affected teachers. It is our greatest desire to aid both CCSS students and employees in these recovery efforts. Any assistance is appreciated.Thank you in advance.

As proud parents and committee members, we are thrilled to announce that the Levey Middle School Marching Jaguars of Southfield, Michigan have been invited to perform in 2016 at the 75th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. We are 1 of 46 groups that were selected and the only Middle School. In order to attend, we need the help from the community. Our overall goal is to raise approximately $250,000 to cover the cost of Hotel, Air Fare, Food and Transportation while in Hawaii. Although we recognize that these are hard economic times for families and businesses across Michigan, we need your help and support. What a sense of pride it would be for our students to be able to participate in a Once in a Lifetime Trip to honor those who fought and/or died while striving to protect American shores.

                        Hi,My name is Jorge Cabrera and I am a teacher at High Tech High International. I am creating this gofundme account in order to raise money for college day.College day is a really important day not only for our schools, but also for our students. Many of our students are low income and never actually get to visit a college before they apply. In fact, most students will not apply to a college because they never got the chance to visit. Every year my goal is to take students outside of San Diego because we can and will visit schools in the area at any time. Most of our students never even get the chance to leave San Diego on a vacation, much less to visit colleges.This year most of our seniors in my advisory would like to attend Oregon University. The cost for us to go will be $500 a person. As I mentioned before, this is a large amount to ask from families. I would love take my advisory and my seniors here on a lifetime experience and give them the opportunity to visit the college of their dreams as well to get the opportunity to travel with the advisory. My advisory would be forever greatful for any donations made. Please help us make this trip a reality. Our low income families do not have the opportunity to take thier children to visit a variety of collegues. The more we spread awareness about college importance, the more likely the student will apply and go. Thank you,Jorge Cabrera

#GFMScholarshipMy name is Dulce and I am an undocumented DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) student. DACA is an immigration policy for certain undocumented young people who came to the US as children. You receive a renewable work permit that comes along with a social security number and exempts you from deportation. Unfortunately, it does not provide lawful statusI recently graduated high school, top 10 in my class with a GPA of 4.3096. I am currently enrolled full-time at Alamance community college, work part-time at Kohl's, sell my drawings on the side, and still find time to volunteer in my community.My goal after high school was to attend The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) for business administration. I received my acceptance letter, but I had to sadly decline the offer because I do not have sufficient money to pay their out-of-state tuition. I have been living in North Carolina since I was 2 years old. The reason I have to pay out-of-state tuition is due to my unlawful status. I am currently paying out-of-state tuition at the community college which is about 3 times as much as in-state tuition. The worst part of my unlawful status is that I am not eligible for federal financial aid either, which is makes everything more difficult for me.I am aware that there are millions of scholarship opportunities, but most require a citizenship status. I did a lot of research during my senior year in high school, and received $3,000 in scholarships for college. Unfortunately, it only covers part of my first semester at my community college. I am paying $3, 500 per semester while an instate student is paying about $1,100. I am struggling to pay my community college tuition now but I am working hard to get through it. I am one 1 out of my family of 6, living in a 2 bedroom apartment where my parents do not have the money to help me pay for college. That is why myparents suggest to only study for an associate's degree at the community college but I want to do so much more for my education and make them proud. I am willing to work hard, and after all the obstacles I am facing, I am still determined for a higher education. I am NOT going to give up so easily!!! That is why I need your help to reach my goal to attend UNCG once I finish the transfer program at Alamance community college. Anything will help, if you're unable to donate please share. Also, check out my Instagram @_dulcesalas_ if you are interested in helping me, by buying my artwork.

""Knowledge is useless if you take it with you instead of sharing it with future generations before you die.""The video these funds will help produce will begoing beyond what is taught in ordinary stockmanship videos. Thesetchniques include ones which allow you to control cattle using indirect pressure, lateral movement, and how to control speed by the angle of your horse to the cow while still travelling paralell to the cow.All techniques will be decribed, then demonstrated while being filmed by an overhead vantage point which will allow you to see how cattle react in relationship to what is being done.The drone will then follow me through the process of rebooting herd instinct in cattle so that holistic planned grazers may follow their grazing plans with far fewer fences and water points.This can actually revolutionize regenerative grazing, especially for those grazing on federal lands, which may soon be a requirement on federal grazing leases.H.R. 5316: Healthy Soils and Rangelands Solutions Actis the first step in eventually requiring all grazing on federal leases to utilize some form of regenerative grazing. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr5316/summaryThe number of cattlemen who have already been through my school programs who have also donated to the production of this video has been humbling, but also show that these methods actually work.In appreciation, anyone donating $30 or more will receive a copy of the video once it is finished. Nonprofits or businesses wanting to sponsor and have their names included in the credits will need to contact me directly.The finished versions will be available in segments for free on YouTube as well as complete versions on Amazon.Thank you very much for allowing me to pass on my knowledge!Bob Kinford2lazy4U Livestock & Literary Co.Van Horn, Texas

HARRISBURG, PA                                





                        Hello,I am Roshan Khadka, a former refugee who spent eighteen years of life in the Bhutanese Refugee Camp in Nepal, after forcefully expelled by Bhutan government in 1990. I am very much thankful to this great nation, the United States forresettling and opening the door of education for me. Currently I am a senior in Penn State University-Harrisburg campus, majoring in Psychology and looking to go for Masters of Social Work (MSW) after my graduation. It is very important for me to get the scholarship offered by #GFMScholsrship to be able to fulfill my dream to help people who have psychological needs.I decided to pursue my career in psychology because there has been much higher sucidal rate among theBhutanese Refugees. I believe that psychological disorders such as depression, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety are the main leading causes of sucide in my community (About 80,000 refugees). After I become a social worker,I intend to help people to overcome psychological problems in their lives and train refugees to cope with various mental illness.In order to fulfill my dream, I need help paying tuition for my Grad school. Therefore I am creating this campaign to be eligible for $10,000 scholarship offered by Gofundme. As per the requirments of the campaign, I need generious donors to donate me. Even a donation of $1 would counts toward the possibility of wining this scholarship.As a former refugee, I had overcome so manyobstacles in my life such as lack of proper foods, cloths and shelters.I went school where there was no electricity, computers or proper library. I know how greatful I am to get an education in this great nation. As a senior, full time student in Penn State University, I am also keeping my part-time job on side to pay my bills. As a result of a hard work and my excellent performance in acadetemia, I was also invited to be the member of National Society of Leardership and Sucess. I value the education I am getting and I am so curious to see how it will change my life and lives of others.If I am selected for the scholarship, I will disperse the fund to pay off my undergraduate loan and tuition fees for my Masters of Social Work. To fulfill my dream to help the Bhutanese refugees who are struggling from various psychological problems, I need your help to make me eligible for the scholarship by donating me a dollar. #GFMScholarship

                        Hi! My name is Chris and I volunteer at Colegio Metropolitano del Sur, a High School in Colombia. The school is made up of bright and motivated students, but lacks some of the most basic resources we take for granted. Every year the school holds English Day; a day of English themed activities that the kids really look forward to. Unfortunately, this year the school does not have the money to support our English Day. The teachers and students have taken it upon themselves to raise funds, but we still need much more to reach our goal. The school also desperately needs projectors as well as other supplies. That is why I am asking you for your help. Your donations, big or small, will be a huge benefit to our students and our school. So please help me give these kids the English Day they deserve and the resources that will give them the opportunity for a better future. Thank you!

                        ""Kanoon goes to Washington"" has been a tradition for the past 3 years at Kanoon. I, the 8th grade teacher, have had the honor of forming part of this experience. Kanoon Elementary is a school situated in the heart of Chicago's Little Village neighborhood with over 95 % of our students coming from low income families. Our parents do not have extra money to provide our students for this experience. Most of our students haven't had the chance to explore outside their surroundings. This is a great opportunity for them to do so. On this trip they will gain inside knowledge of our country's history. Our mission is to provide our students with the opportunity that many seek, but can't accomplish due to funds. I believe this trip will motivate students to want to do great inside and out of school.

                        Dia de los Muertos is one of the many cultural celebrations that your student will celebrate in class this year. In the past, I have successfully been able to fund the ever growing event by securing a grant for Arts in the Classroom thru Silicon Valley Educational Foundation. This year, they are not re-granting to previous grantees; nor have I been able to find a grant that will fund such a celebration.During our Dia de los Muertos week, students will participate in song, dance, reading and writing cultural calavera poems. Our cultural unit culminates with a traditional meal prepared by me and students create their own sugar skull calavera to take home; dietary restrictions are taken into consideration and there is something for everyone.Last year our buffet included Jamaica juice, Horchata, yucca, gallo pinto, atole, tacos filled with chicken, beef or potato along with rice and beans. Dead bread and other assorted Dia de los Muertos chocolates finished the meal. It is my hope to continue this tradition as many students have asked when they are going to make their sugar skulls. If you feel that you and your family would like to make a personal donation to help me make this event possible for all students, please consider making a donation. The cost per student is $10.00.

PHILADELPHIA, PA                                





                        Hello, my name is Amir Fluellen and this is my story:I was born in inner-city philadelphia to a single parent home consisting of my mother and 3 brothers. My father was incarcerated before I could walk, so the only way I've known him is inside of a brown jumpsuit, behind wired gates and thick concrete walls. When I turned 5 years old I was sitting on my father's lap with my mother and brothers inside of a prison visiting room and I made him a promise. I promised to be successful and make him proud by going to school and getting a college degree. From then on it's been my goal to be the young man my parents have always wished I could be. In 2004 my mom suffered a work related injury that ended her work career and rendered her disabled, my dream was now geared towards making my dreams come true for the sake of my parents' dreams being deferred. A few years later I had attended a charter school (mastery charter). This school provided great opportunities for me but not enough to achieve the success that I thought would be possible to reach the goals I had for myself. During the summer of my sophomore year I thought that I would apply to a private school(Shipley) to try to garner better relationships and set myself up for success in the future. After two years at Shipley I was able to get into a really good school with a great buisness program that would help me with my major (finance) and help to provide a career for me after school. This summer before attending college my mother was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma or kidney cancer. This was a very hard time for my family, it put me under a lot of stress mentally and financially and made it hard to get ready to be a college student let alone an athlete. In August a few days before I was scheduled to attend college my mother had another appointment with a specialist where we found that her cancer had somehow gone away. It was like having the weight of the world lifted off of your shoulders but little did I know that weight would only resume it's place. The weight wasn't in the form of cancer but had now become monetary. Without any family financial support and little from the university I still need a lot more to ensure that my dreams become reality. Help of any kind is greatly appreciated by me (and my family) and is surely going to a great cause. I would like to finish with a bachelor's degree and this go fund me project is the only way that can be possible. your donations are a direct result of any success I have in the future and are greatly appreciated. I am the first of my mother's 4 children to pursue a degree at a university. My entire life I have sought to be better than the community I was raised in. Drugs, crime and death are all apart of my story, but they are not who I am, I would like to be a difference in my community and my family instead of a negative statistic. #GFMscholarship

The 2016 SAGE score results are in, and George Washington Academy (GWA) had the highest proficiency ratings in Washington County in both math and science, and we ranked second in language arts. Overall, GWA was ranked one of the top 10 schools in Utah in both math and science! These results are even more impressive considering that most of the states students are still below proficiency levels. Our children work hard in the classroom to achieve these academic results, and they deserve an inspiring space outside of the classroom where they can also play hard, gather with friends and receive the exercise they need to maintain the focus and academic rigor that GWA demands.The outdoor space at GWA is desperately in need of improvement. Our facilities were significantly impacted by the improvements made to the carpool lanes, and now we need to redesign and build an outdoor space to complement the facilities and education we provide our students. We would like to see the old field transformed into a beautiful, multipurpose space that will directly advance our Mission Statement by establishing a learning environment where each child may develop the skills necessary to help them succeed. . . Our grounds will include a state-of-the-art obstacle course, an outdoor classroom, an outdoor science laboratory, a walking path for exercise, and free-space with trees that will provide much needed shade for our students to sit and relax. This year, the middle school engineering class will participate in the design and construction of the classroom, laboratory, and gardena cost-savings for the project while contributing to these kids education.You can help build a better environment for our childrens education. While the school has allocated a portion of its budget to this project, much more is needed. To build the aforementioned facilities we need will cost approximately $100,000far too great a burden for our school whose budget is, appropriately, directed towards our childrens education. Your support is crucial, if we want to provide this opportunity for our children as well as the next generation of GWA students. Your tax-deductible contribution will be used in its entirety to help complete this project. Every contribution, no matter how small or how big, is needed and much appreciated. For those who are able to give larger amounts, we have created several different levels and forms of recognition to say thank you:$250      Name on a plaque to be displayed at school$500      Tree planted in your honor$1,000    Bench with your name on it$5,000    Sponsor one of the nine new play-stations$10,000  Amphitheater named in your honorThank you, sincerely, for your dedication to our wonderful school.

NEW YORK, NY                                





                        My name is Immaculee Ilibagiza, and I am survivor of the Rwandan genocide, in which nearly 1 million of my family and fellow countrymen were lost. At first I didn't understand why I survived, but it later became clear that I was to use my life to share with people things that I had learned in my childhood, especially the knowledge I had about the apparitions of Our Lady.  Many people don't realize that Mary appeared to three high school girls at a school called Mere Du Verbe in Kibeho. The apparitions were so compelling because Sheactually warned us about the genocide 12 years before it ever happened, and one of the main reasons why the Vatican approved it so quickly in the year 2000. The site where our lady appeared is truly a holy site where many pilgrims come from all over the world to pay homage to Our Lady of Sorrows, but sadly, the school on the grounds serves some of Rwanda's poorest children, and they are studying in the most abject poverty.The school lacks the funds for adequate nutrition, clean water, basic healthcare, textbooks, even pillows. The Sisters of Benebikira who run this school are struggling to keep Mere Du Verbe open. With your help, we can easily help the Sisters rebuild this school.They arejust the best, most loving and smart human beings. However I cried when I saw the conditions in which they live in. They have very little. It was always one of the poorest school in the country, but you know Our Lady always chooses the most humble, in a way, to raise them up I think. The kids are disciplined, clean, smart, but they barely have enough to eat. It is a high school, they are about 640 kids who all live there (12-17 years old). Outside, the school looks beautiful, but inside they are a lot of needs. For example, they need a new kitchen, they have water outside the school but they don't have the capacity to bring it inside the school. They need to extend sleeping area, they need to redo the bathrooms, kids have to come outside to go to the bathroom at night. They need more books, pens, shoes, soaps, toothbrush, medicine etc... The kids are some of the smartest kids ever, but many are very poor, so the nuns accept them anyway. Everything is out-dated or simply doesn't function anymore. When I visited the school last time with friends, we asked the leaders of the school if they have an account for the poor, so we can donate. They said yes, and we found out they had about $18 in the account. We were in tears. I never wanted to buy tea again.Your generosity will go to:UniformsSchool Fees/BooksFood for yearKitchen Utensils/DishesMedical Supplies/Bed/safety cabinetRunning Water into Kitchen/BathroomsAnother DormitoryDining hall/Kitchen RemodelA school carBathroom/shower reconstructionAt least35 computersIf you heart tells you to help, kindly consider, it will come back to you. Any amount will help.100%will be sent. Your donation istax-deductible. We will surely follow up with video and progress photos so you can see where the money is going.I have spent my life speaking about my homeland, and in the past 10 years, I began bringing people back there because so many wereasking me to bring you back.  Those trips have been complete blessings to Rwanda, as your money goes a long way there, and you have already done so many great things there already. This is my first time having a Go Fund Me Account, but it is because this project is so near and dear to my heart. This is OUR LADY's school! She chose it! These children deserve better, and I know the generousity of my friends can help make this a better place for this precious chirldren. God Bless You for any little thing you can do!For those who don't know me, I am including my bio:About me: Immacule Ilibagiza is a living example of faith put into action. Immacule's life was transformed dramatically during the 1994 Rwandan genocide where she and seven other women spent 91 days huddled silently together in the cramped bathroom of a local pastor's house. Immacule entered the bathroom a vibrant, 115-pound university student with a loving family - she emerged weighing just 65 pounds to find her most of her family had been brutally murdered.Immacule credits her salvage mostly to prayer and to a set of rosary beads given to her by her devout Catholic father prior to going into hiding. Anger and resentment about her situation were literally eating her alive and destroying her faith, but rather than succumbing to the rage that she felt, Immacule instead turned to prayer. She began to pray the rosary as a way of drowning out the negativity that was building up inside her. Immacule found solace and peace in prayer and began to pray from the time she opened her eyes in the morning to the time she closed her eyes at night. Through prayer, she eventually found it possible, and in fact imperative, to forgive her tormentors and her family's murderers.Immacule's strength in her faith empowered her to stare down a man armed with a machete threatening to kill her during her escape. She also later came face to face with the killer of her mother and her brother and said the unthinkable, ""I forgive you."" Immacule knew, while in hiding, that she would have to overcome immeasurable odds without her family and with her country destroyed. Fortunately, Immacule utilized her time in that tiny bathroom to teach herself English with only The Bible and a dictionary; once freed she was able to secure a job with the United Nations. In 1998, Immacule immigrated to the United States where she continued her work with the UN. During this time she shared her story with co-workers and friends, who were so impacted they insisted she write it down in book form. Three days after finishing her manuscript she met best selling author, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, who, within minutes of meeting her, offered to publish her book. Dyer is quoted as saying, ""There is something much more than charisma at work here - Immacule not only writes and speaks about unconditional love and forgiveness, but she radiates it wherever she goes.""Immacule's first book, Left to Tell; Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust (Hay House) was released in March of 2006. Left to Tell quickly became a New York Times Best Seller. To date it has been translated into fifteen languages worldwide. Immacule's story has also been made into a documentary titled ""The Diary of Immacule."" She has appeared in numerous media including 60 Minutes, CNN, EWTN, The Aljazeera Network, The New York Times, USA Today, Newsday, and many other domestic and international outlets. She was recently featured in Michael Collopy's ""Architects of Peace"" project, which has honored legendary people like Mother Teresa, Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama.Immacule has received honorary doctoral degrees from The University of Notre Dame, Saint John's University, and Walsh University. She has been recognized and honored with numerous humanitarian awards including: The Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Reconciliation and Peace 2007; a finalist as one of Belifnet.com's ""Most Inspiring People of the Year 2006,"" and a recipient of the American Legacy's Women of Strength & Courage Award. Left to Tell has received a Christopher Award ""affirming the highest values of human spirit,"" and been chosen as Outreach Magazine's selection for ""Best Outreach Testimony/Biography Resource of 2007."" Left to Tell has been adopted into the curriculum of dozens of high schools and universities, including Villanova University, which selected it for the 2007-2008 ""One Book Program,"" making Left to Tell mandatory reading for 6,000 students. Immacule recently hosted a documentary titled ""Ready to Forgive, An African Story of Grace,"" a project sponsored by The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. The film focuses on the Acholi people of Northern Uganda and their desire to forgive their tormentors. ""Ready to Forgive"" has been broadcasted on NBC and the Hallmark Channel.Immacule recently signed a contract with MPower Pictures to produce a major motion picture about her story.Today Immacule is regarded as one of world's leading speakers on peace, faith, and forgiveness. She has shared her universal message with world dignitaries, school children, multinational corporations, churches, and at many conferences. Immacule works hard to spread her message and to raise money for her Left to Tell Charitable Fund which directly benefits the children orphaned by the genocide.Please visit my website at  www.immaculee.comto learn more

                        On February 6, 2016 Natarvis ""Beeper""Chang was called to glory unexpectedly leaving a great legacy behind for his friends and family. Beeper was a very successful football coach and a great father to Natali ""Chip"" Thomas. Upon Chip's birth, Tiffani and Natarvis instilled the importance of education and started a college fund that will one day be used towards educational expenses. In honor of Beep's life, I am asking close friends and family to support this initiative by making a financial contribution towards Chip's fund. By no means will this make up for the tragedy in losing a great friend, but it is a simple gesture that you are supporting the legacy that Beeper has left behind.

                        Nearly a decade ago I left a conventional lifestyle to pursue the study and practice of holistic plant medicine. This has taken me outdoors, working full time on organic farms, growing and crafting whole food for communities. It has led me to the fields and woods, wild harvesting medicinal plants and learning from the plants themselves through the seasons. It has led me to connecting with amazing people, incredible teachers both near and far, and starting and operating my own apothecary where I help those in my local community through the power and beauty of wildcrafted medicine.It's been an amazing few years and I am ready for the next transition which will take me to a higher purpose in my holistic education.Two years ago I created an idea that I kept quiet for several months while I turned it around in my head and looked at if from every angle, adding and reorganizing the details. I then began to share it with family and friends and know that now is the time to act on it.The money for this fundraiser will go towards the purchase of the schoolbus featured in the video and it's conversion to a bio fueled, solar powered house and apothecary on wheels. This bus will be my very first home that I own and it will serve as a place to continue my apothecary and to embark on a two year, pre-mapped journey across the country to continue my herbal education by traveling to specific healers and teachers to work one on one with them for scheduled stints of time. If you follow my instagram you will know I enjoy writing down my medicine stories and this journey will be no exception. I hope to write my experiences to publish a travelogue and herbal medicine book in the future.This bus will not ony serve as my only home but it will enable me to create this two year herbal intensive that I feel is vital to give me the experience and knowledge neccessary for my future as an educator and a healer.Areas of study I will be further pursuing:Wild plant identification + cultivated plants and ways they heal the bodyHolistic medicine support for womenMidwifery and/or Doula supportAncient wisdom for land protection/stewardshipSacred and holistic beekeeping practicesThe breakdown: The bus has a diesel engine I wish to convert to biofuel meaning it will run primarily on recycled vegetable oil. The interior will be treated as seriously as anyone would when renovating a home, adding wooden floors, a small wood burning stove, kitchen, sleeping space, and compostable toliet. It is important to me that this home is as energy efficient as possible therefore it will be off grid with my water source obtained through a filtered raincatch system and electricity will be entirely solar powered. I will be looking to obtain my materials used or recycled as much as possible. Additions I would love to build on are a small coop for my chickens and a top deck with a small rooftop garden. I will be a part of the whole renovation process, learning a lot along the way and receiving help from talented and skilled people I know.Anyone who has known me from a small child or even a few weeks knows that I am always around animals. The past three years of my life have been working with farmer's and homesteader's herds using natural rearing methods. Ive been working with animals since a kid and it is my nature so it is therefore only natural to me that some of my animals will take this journey with me such as my Corgi, Yuri, featured in this video.One of the largest challenges of this project is asking for help but it is impossible without it. If I am fortunate enough to be funded, my donars will have the option to be added onto a newsletter to receive regular updates on the bus renovation as it takes place. My goal would be to have it renovated and ready by late spring of 2017. If I am blessed enough to receive more than my asked amount, it will all go into a fund to support me while I am on the road helping with food provisions and emergency repairs if needed.This journey will be life altering, I am sure of it, but it is with great sincerity that I am one more person working towards the health of this planet and its people.Please help my cause by posting this video on your social media and asking others to do the same.You can follow me on Instagram @roamingsoulapothecary or on Facebook at Roaming Soul ApothecaryPlant Blessings,Dani

Now we want to try and refurbish it as much as we can... it is a tall order as we need to raise $40,000 but we will do as much as we can.The aim of this is two fold1. Refurnish the school2. Send the kids on an animal education course to teach them about living with animals and trying to deter them from poaching etc, We firmly believe education is the way to go.I remember the looks on the kids' faces when we were handing out soccer balls and tennis balls when we were last there (see attached slide show), you can never appreciate what these kids don't have until you see it in person... we can truly make a difference.Our friends Roger and Jessica at Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust are helping us and all donations will go through their non profit organization, and I promise 100% of the money we raise will go to thes causes.You can specify exactly where you would like your donation to go if you have a preference, All details are on the slide show, or you can email me directly if you have specific questions.We will be running this campaign for several months culminating with a fundraiser in San Diego at the end of the year. I know there are a lot of great causes out there, but every penny helps so we hope you can support us ...Thank you in advance for your support

HAMMOND, IN                                





                        Hi, my name is Camila, I`m 25 years old, and an international student from Brazil and a legal resident of the U.S., majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University Northwest  Calumet Campus. I finally made it to my senior year, and after all I`ve been through to get where I`m now, I have no words to describe how grateful I am for the opportunities Ive been given in this great and free country. My battle is still not over, though, in fact this is the hardest one I`ve been fighting in order to graduate, and that`s why I`m here. I needhelp to pursue my dream of finishing my collegeeducation. Right now I have a past due balance of about $6,000 and about $6,000 for this semester,which if I don`t pay I`ll be kicked out of my classes and have to go back home and give up on graduating. Purdue allowed me to enroll in classes this fall because they heard my story and wanted to give me the opportunity to finish my education by allowing me additional time to raise the funds. Unfortunately, time is running out, and my options have narrowed. So any help I can get would be amazing. I'm a very passionate person and I have been working as hard as I can for 5 years to achieve my dreams and make a difference. I strongly believe that how much you're willing to work for your dreams is what will make it come true! So,I won`t give on fighting to getthere!  I would love for you all to get to know me, so I am adding my journey below. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I truly appreciate your support. God bless you. Sincerely, Camila Pillo #GFMScholarshipWho I AmI grew up in the country side in the southeast part of Brazil, in a small town called Porciuncula (an Indian word meaning small portion). Porciuncula is right in the middle of a valley with gorgeous waterfalls, and the view from the top of the mountains is breathtaking. Our population is about 18,000 people, and our town economy is based on coffee farms and cattle. I grew up next door to my grandparents in a small house with my mother and two sisters, one older and one younger.Unfortunately, Porciuncula is not a place with lots of opportunity, and my town  like many others throughout Brazil  is in an ongoing battle against poverty and government corruption. In Brazil, more than 40 million people (out of a population of just over 200 million) live on less than $4.00 per day, and the average yearly income for a person in Brazil was $9,850 in 2015.[1] Income inequality is severein Brazil, the bottom 40% of earners hold barely 10% of the countrys total wealth.[2] Sadly, rural areas like my hometown are most affected by this inequality, and I saw those I loved and cared for struggle to provide for themselves and their families for most of my life. This affected me deeply and instilled in me a passion to make a difference (although at the time, I had no idea how).Growing up, I was a very energetic and creative kid. I was fascinated about learning how things work, and I`ve always been a dreamer. I used to believe I could figure out how to fix anything, which resulted me taking a lot of things apart (and unfortunately for my mom, my ambitions as a small child exceeded my abilities). With time and patience, however, I actually got better, and began learning how to really fix things, which only further inspired my passion and helped me choosing engineering as a life career.With my family on Father`s Day, 2014.Starting my College JourneyWhen I finally graduated High School in December of 2009 I was so excited to start college. I had worked hard and been accepted in 3 top universities back home. I remember how proud and happy I was from accomplishing this. However, I had to put my feet on the ground and face that my family wouldn`t be able to afford sending me away for college. My house income at that point was 30% less of how much would cost for me to go to college. So, I didn`t start college at that time, and that was the first battle I had to face to get to my dream of becoming an engineer.With that I took one year off working at my grandparents' butcher shop and studying computer assembly and maintenance at night in a Technical School. My mom was frustrated and heartbroken not seeing me fulfill my potential, so she encouraged me to apply to a community college near home. By February 2011, I was enrolled in classes and back on track towards obtaining my engineering degree.I remember by that time I hadnt stopped believing in myself, or in my dream of getting the best education I could, but all this made me realize that willpower only would not take me where I wanted to go. I would have to fight for it. During that period my grandmother told me this: Camila, don`t worry. I know if you keep working hard towards your dream, eventually your opportunity will come. I hold on to that till this day, and it turns out she was right; in 2014, I became aware of a scholarship program that was sending students abroad to specialize themselves in scientific areas.First Physics Project about Resonance back on my Community College, 2011.A Great OpportunityI knew this might be my only chance, so the decision for me was not difficult. I didn`t think twice and applied to the programbut I had another big challenge ahead of me. In order to be approved for that scholarship I would have to pass the TOEFL Exam (An English Language Proficiency Exam used to place international students in Universities all over the U.S.). I always wanted to learn English but my mom couldn`t afford to pay for an English School, so I had to find another alternative.Thats when I decided I would study on my own. I used TV shows with Portuguese subtitles as my main source of learning English. My next step was to find every book and tests examples I could online and study hard for the exam. As the test is expensive, the program pays for each student to take it once, so students that can`t afford it  like myself  still have a chance to be part of the program.Having only have one try was very stressful. When I sat in the classroom I felt the weight of what it meant and I started feeling nervous. But I took a deep breath and reminded myself of what my grandma had told me. I worked as hard I could, so if it was meant to be, it would be. The day I got my score was one the happiest ones in my life. I had passed.Working as a Campus AmbassadorThe Greatest OpportunityThat`s how I came to the U.S in August of 2014, on a 16 months long exchange program. My first semester I took only English classes, and then I was able to spend two semesters in the academic program. I can say with no doubt that it was the best 16 months of my life. I finally felt I was in a place that would value my potential and where I could explore my creativity.I`m a Campus Ambassador at Purdue, and one day I was giving a tour at our Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation (CIVS) and the director called me aside to ask me who I was and what my major was because she noticed me during my tours and that I seemed pretty knowledgeable about engineering. After talking to her for a while she invited me to an interview and offered me a position with them. Ive chosen engineering because it is something I believe I can use to make a difference in the world, so this meant the world to me.Coming from a small place where I would never be recognized like that for a lack of opportunities, opened my eyes to how much I had conquered so far. This happened in November of 2015, two months before I was going back home for good and to my scholarship to end. The program I came here with would not be extended no matter how good of opportunity I had. If I decided to continue pursuing my dream, I would be on my own.It was definitely the hardest decision I had to make. While I was listing my pros and cons, and my possibilities, something came across my mind.Finding Inspiration to Move ForwardMy mother is my biggest inspiration from raising three kids on her own. She always worked hard so we could have the best she could afford to give us. She even had two jobs at some point to provide for us. So, I found inspiration and courage to pursue it in my mother, and I made a compromise with myself to work as hard as she always did to raise us. She never gave up of giving us the best she could and neither would I to pursue on being the best I can.As I became responsible for my expenses at the minute I decided to transfer here on my own, I currently work two jobs on campus, and I`m not allowed to work outside campus as an international student. I make just enough to pay for my rent and food, and as of now I can`t afford to pay my tuition. Since January I`ve been working as hard I as can to figure out how I`m going to pay for it. Unfortunately I haven`t come with a solution yet, but I also haven`t given up on finding one.I`m sure I`m not the only one struggling to achieve something that seems impossible, and I`m also sure Im not the last one. Knowing that there are people out there still trying, even in worse situations than mine, gives me hope and energy to keep fighting. I strongly believe that how much you want and how much you`re willing to work for your dreams, is what can make them true.Thank you very much for your time spent reading my story. I`m eternally grateful for that, even if what you can help me with is a word of encouragement.Thank you![1] World Bank Group, Poverty Database,  http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/BRA[2] World Bank Group, Poverty Database,  http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/BRA

                                                            on behalf of Dan Dickinson

WINNETKA, IL                                




Help My Brother Go To CollegeMy names is James C.Nortey, a recent graduate from Marquette University. I am trying to raise funds to help my brother, Ebenezer (Eben), start university in Ghana. Eben was recentlyaccepted to University of Professional Studies Accra: a dream hes been working towards all his life. I am incredibly proud of how hard he has worked for this andam doing my best to ensure he is able to obtain a college education.Eben's StoryEben is the third born in my family. He lives at La Kojo Sardine, one of the most socially and economically deprived communities in Accra, where young people are effectively encouraged to stop going to school as soon as they can, in order to work and earn money for their families.With many of Ebens friends already out of school by the age of 14, you can imagine how it would have been easy for him to do the same. Yet, Eben stayed in school becasue he saw the value of education. He says he was inspired by how education has helped me. He realized by staying in school and working hard, he could receive new opportunities and impact our family and his local community in a positive way. Eben worked very hard to keep himself in school and accomplish his life-long dream of attending college.  At age 13, he got his first job at a local grinding factory, grinding fruit and vegetables. He worked in the factory for over two years, while he was in Junior Secondary School (JSS). When he was accepted to a Senior Secondary School (SSS),he had to stop because the job conflicted with his school schedule.Eben thenfound another job with an event planning group to fit around his SSS studies.As his school and work schedule became more settled,Eben chose to dedicate the remainder of his free time to his local community by volunteering as a math teacher at a football academy in Accra. There, he teaches basic math to the younger students.Until his graduation from SSS, he continued to juggle school, work and volunteering. At age 19, my brother graduated from Senior Secondary School, and I encouraged him to fufil his dream and apply to universities in Ghana. A month after he applied, he received acceptance to one of Ghanas best business schools,UPSA ( http://upsa.edu.gh)Needless to say, I could not be more proud of the tenacity, determination and dedication Eben has shown. He has worked tirelessly to put himself in the position of achieving a college degree.He is very close to the next step of his dream but I would hate to see all of his hard work and self-discipline go to waste because of financial challenges. This is why I need your help. The school tuition fees of $1,500/year may seem small compared to tuition fees in the US, however when the average salary in La Kojo Sardine is less than $2/day, you can see how its a big challenge for someone like my brother to pay his way through university. I would love to be in a position to fund his tuition and not have to reach out and ask for help, but unfortunatly I am not.My first goal is to raise at least enough funds for him to start his first year at university. It works out that if everyone on my Facebook donated $1, we could raise the tuition fees quickly. My second goal would be to raise enough money to secure the full 4 years of his tuition ($6000). If everyone on my Facebook gave $4 we could cover the fees for the duration of his education. If you aren't able to give, that's not a problem. Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you are in a position to help, a big thank you from me, but also from Eben. I know what your contribution means to him in helping him to pursue his educational dream, but also allowing him to continue to giveback and inspire his local community through being a role model, volunteer and a student.Thank you very much for your help.University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA

"Build a School for Besakoa Ambany,,,Education," September 22, 2016",6,3,614 Madagadcar,,99000,,1,"






                            Barry Ferguson
                            
                            
                                                           
614 Madagadcar                                





                        The children of Besakoa Ambany, in the far south of Madagascar have been through a lot in recent years, with violent cattle rustlers coming from the north to raid their zebu cattle, many children had to live in the forest for months on end. Since the cattle raids stopped in 2015 the people of the village have come together and want to make a better future for their children. They have clubbed together to hire a teacher, and one family is letting a room of their house be used as a temporary classroom.This campaign is to raise funds to build, furnish and provide supplies for the villages first school for 70+ children who want to study.I have undertaken research with the people of Besakoa on and off since 2007, on visiting earlier this year I was able to see how both parents and children are motivated to get education going in the village.100% of the funds raised will be used to build the school with costs including transport of materials from Fort Dauphin to the village, the services of a mason, carpenter and foreman as well as local labour.  The mason and carpenter will be Randria, a Tandroy man who I have worked with on previous school building projects in Zanavo, Mariarano and Ankilimitombo. The foreman for the project is still to be recruited but will probably come from my former Malagasy student supervisees from the Libanona Ecology Centre. This project is important to me in several ways: 1. The region where the school will be built has been very neglected and subject to insecurity due to cattle rustling. The people have already shown their own determination to get education started - its a big deal for a community to collectively contribute money to hire and pay a teacher. This school will definitely be used to great effect.2. This was a village where I got sick with Malaria in 2008 while I was doing fieldwork, not long before my 8 year old daughter was born. The family who looked after me also had a daughter that year, and seeing her and my daughter playing together under the tamarind tree it struck me just how much education gives kids a chance. 3. The forest which the people of Besakoa Ambany live from is very characteristic of the Madagascar's southern spiny thickets, home to many rare and endemic plants and animals. Education has the potential to support some people to get into careers outside the village and hopefully to lead to sustainable use of the forest which Missouri Botanical Gardens has set up as a protected area.4. The village has hosted several groups of students over the years: from the University of East Anglia (20007-8), School for International Training (2009) and the Libanona Ecology Centre (2015) hopefully the networks of the students who had the privelage to study the unique culture and biodiversity there will be able to help get the word out and to make some contributions.About the village: Besakoa Ambany is a small village in the Commune of Mahaly, District of Amboasary-Sud in the far south of Madagascar, about 200km as the crow flies from the main city in the region, Fort Dauphin. The people of the village are Antandroy, an ethnic group known for their farming, cattle raising and strong traditions. The region is a dryland, so conditions are tough. The village is located right on the north eastern rim of the ancien Androy Volcano, where the Mandrare rivers flows during the rainy season.We want to start construction of the school as soon as the Christmas and New Year holidays are over in January 2017, and to complete construction and furniture by the end of April 2017.Barry Ferguson, 39, a native of Newtownards, County Down in Northern Ireland. I am a university level teacher working for SIT-Study Abroad and am involved in environmental justice research and action across the island. I have been workingon conservation and development issues insouthern Madagascar, where I currently live and work, for the last 18 years.

Having no computer laboratories, one library with computer access, and only two COW (Computers on Wheels) carts, technology is limited for student access at the school I am teaching. What is my proposal to ensure my students technology needs are met? Tablets. Tablets are wireless, portable personal computers with a touch screen interface that are often smaller than a laptop but larger than a smartphone. They have much of the same capabilities as computers.I have firsthand experience with seeing student response to technology implementation into daily lessons; very seldom are students bored or not engaged. By supplying each of the thirteen tables of my classroom (three students per table) with a tablet, students are able to build skills necessary to be successful in a technologically diverse society. I include educational apps and websites, assessment tools, research assignments, video streaming, and typing in my lesson plans. By having a device for students to actively follow along with and use, I can ensure their involvement in student learning. Also, by integrating the use of tablets in my classroom, I can secure pupil development of fundamental computer etiquette, which will help to alleviate misuse of this great tool.

                                                During my 22 years as an educator, Ive made it a goal to advocate and to teach for public education. Ive been lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to the community in which I grew up in, and to be apart of an urban setting where I am desperately needed. Organizations have a mission statement, yet people should have a cause statement. My cause statement is to help, to serve, and to improve unconditionally and positively without regard. Throughout the years Ive received many accolades for my participation in affecting the lives of many former students who have now become professionals around the world. My contributions have not only been for my students, but also for the professional education associations in which I am apart of. My work at the national level has included advocacy for public education, and many social justice issues for women, and people of color. I want to continue this work in my capacity as NEA Board of Director to help create a better understanding of the educational issues that plague our great state and nation. This campaign is my third run for this seat! Previous opportunities landed just shy of becoming elected. The funds will be used for campaign literature, flyers, travel expenses to different regions to do presentations, and other expenses related to organizing a successful campaign. Major monetary amounts are not totally necessary, yet small increments like $5, $10, or $15 will help greatly! If you would like to donate more, that just makes the chances more attainable. Thank you so much for your contribution and I look forward to serving our students, our profession, and our State in Washington, D.C.!

All three were well known in the community for their loving demeanor and generosity. They served as role models to the youth of the local community. The lives of these three beautiful souls were taken viciously in an act of execution-style hate crime.In these dark times when we are searching for answers and wrestling with what to do, it is important to celebrate the lives of these fallen heroes and build upon their legacy of personal excellence and public service.In their honor, The Deah Yusor Razan Endowment Fund has been created by the Islamic Scholarship Fund to provide annual scholarships for three students who uphold the same values of achievement and service and pursuit of theISF goals.

Hi everyone!

My name is Joseph Kahrs and I could really use your help. I am a father of 3 wonderful children and a 14 year veteran of the armed forces with disasterrelief and combat operations experience. I have earned a huge scholarship to Tulane University based on academic achievement while working full-time to support my family of 5 on a single income. My goal is to earn a law degree and become a member of the United States Congress. I want nothing more than to serve the people as an honorable, reasonable, and responsible public servantso I maycontribute to a brighter future for our children. My pathway leads through one of the bestuniversities in the nation,and that is where I need your help making ends meet. With your $5 donation I can attend Tulane in the Spring and overcome this financial difficulty. If you want to know more about my story, character, situation, or goals, please continue to read on!The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 occurred a few months prior tomy 17th birthday and cemented my prior plans to join the military. I joined the Louisiana National Guard andspentthe summer between my Junior and Senior years of high school at Fort Knox completing my Basic Training. I then graduated high school and began working my way through college at Southeastern Louisiana University. Shortly thereafter, Hurricane Katrina hit our area and my course in life was altered significantly.

After my unit activation for the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort, I returned to my parents' home in Slidell to help them rebuild. I soon met my wife, fell in love, got married, and had the first of our three children.

Over the past 10 years, I have been a full-time employee with my National Guardunit. I have been deployed for combat operations overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and I have served in humanitarian roleshere at home and abroad. These recovery efforts have included hurricanes such as Katrina and Isaac; Texas wildfires; school construction in Belize; the BP Oil Spill; theearthquake in Haiti; and the catastrophic flooding of recent memory.

While working full time and then some, I have been able to support a family of 5 on my single income and put my wife through college. My experiences from the deployments and disasters have shown me the effects that good and poor government can have on people. In my travels, I have seen the best and worst of people and political structures. These experiences motivated me to restartmy college education. I decided to transform my lifelong dream of earning my law degree and seeking political office into a realistic goal.

In 2012 I re-enrolled at Southeastern Louisiana University.Since that time, we have remained a single income family and I have completed over 80 credit hours whileoften working more than50+ hours per week. Despite this challenge, my GPA at SELU was 3.97 and Iwas honored on the President's List every semester. Not long ago, my world and plans were shaken when several of my friends and coworkers passed away unexpectedly in a military helicopter training accident. One of them I had known for my entire military career, and another was the brightest soul I have ever known. Losing them caused me to seriously evaluate my life and priorities. I came out of that grieving stage with two concepts firmly entrenched in my mind: love and appreciate every second of life with your family and friends, and never limit yourself or settle for second best because this is the only chance we ever have at pursuing our dreams.This realization motivated me to aim higher, so I submitted my transferapplication to Tulane University.Not only was I admitted to Tulane, but I was also awarded a full scholarship due to my outstanding academic performance at SELU. Being awarded this scholarship to one of the best universities in the country is an amazing opportunity that means the world to me, the experiences and knowledge gained there are unparalleled in this region. However, in order to attend Tulane I must leave my current job because the two schedules are incompatible.I will needto start working in a night/weekend job to support my family while attending school during the day.I am preparedto work full-time while attending school just like I have been for the past 3 years. However, starting entry at a new job will require a 50% pay cut and my wife has needed to start working to make up the lost wages. Although she has been trying diligently, she has been unable to secure a job that makes enough money to cover the difference. Concerned about my children's well-being, I decided it was best to pass on this Fallsemester while we attempt to work out the financial aspects of this major life transition. I can't bring myself to jump from this cliff and bring my children with me without knowing whether or not we will be able to make ends meet for them.



With your helping hands, I will be able to climb this mountain in enough time to avoid missing out on this amazing scholarship. I will be able to attend Tulane and excel in the future just like I have in the past. I have never asked for help when I could do something myself, and I maintain that fighting spirit today, but I recognize that this is beyond my control and I am relying on your generosity to help overcome this final hurdle. If I pass on the scholarship again, I may not be offered it the next Fall. Most people will never get an opportunity like this, and I don't know if I will ever get another. I already have accumulated over $35,000 in student loans up to this point, which makes this scholarship award even more critical.What I humbly request is this: If you believe my past, present, and future service is worth something; and if you believe in my potential and work ethic; please donate to my cause so that I may achieve this goal. The money will be used only as a financial parachute, to help cover living expenses arising the first year.

If you're willing to make a small contribution,together we can raise $30,000 or moreand I willattend Tulane next semester while we work in lower-income jobs to get our feet underneath us. The donations will be put into a savings account and will only be touched to help cover monthly expenses such as food, electricity, gas, and housing. If we can raise more than $30,000, then any additional funds wouldallow me to take less work hours, greatly increasing my ability to perform well in school and allowing me to spend precious time with my children during these next few years.

When our goal is met, I will know my kids will be able to eat every night in a stablehome while I begin a new path toward improvingmyself for the benefit of my family, state, and country. I hope that one day I can look back and say that I didn't let my pride stand in the way of my dreams, and that I was able to put myself on a limb by allowing others to help me open the door to a better future for all.

Thank you for reading my short story. I hope you will find my cause worthy of your donations, and I appreciate every cent offered more than you'll ever understand. Please, share this post with your friends and leave a comment with your thoughts so that we have a chance to reach others and meet our fundraising goal.

Sincerely, Joseph Kahrs

                                                            on behalf of Anthony Cannavina

MORRIS PLAINS, NJ                                




""Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.""Although he has been losing vision since birth, Brian Cannavina has always been someone who sees the possibilities. Despite having a rare, degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Brian remains an avid runner, has earned his college degree, and is currently working full time at a special education high school as a classroom aide.Brian's symptoms began at an early age and presently, he is legally blind even with his glasses. While his prescription glasses afford him a minimal amount of vision, he has lost his peripheralvision and has no sight at all when it is dark (think nighttime, movie theaters, and even dimly lit restaurants). His vision loss will continue to progress. There is not yet a cure for RP - but there IS the possibility togive Brian sight.eSight is a device that looks like a fancy pair of sunglasses, but actually contains a small, high-speed camera and computer that instantly sends back an enhanced video to the headset.Brian recently had the opportunity to participate in an eSight demonstration and it was determined that the device could give him unprecedented visual clarity (taking him from 20/200 with his glasses, to 20/40!).It is my most heartfelt dream to give Brian sight. It has always been a privilege to assist my determined, resilient - and of course, extremelysarcastic - older brother. However, giving 26-year-old Brian his vision would provide him with the gift of autonomy. It would give him the ability to navigate the worldsafely, discern between the paper bills in his wallet, text friends and loved ones on a cell phone, better assist his students, and moreover, be able to interact more fully with the world by not being limited by blindness.More information on eSight can be found at http://www.esighteyewear.com/.  There are many articles about how it has worked for others - here's just one!  http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/01/23/dnt-legallly-blind-mom-sees-newborn.cbcThank you from our entire family,Brian, Megan, Kevin, Carly, Kathy, and Anthony Cannavina

WHO AM I?My name is Khadija. A 25 years old, born in Belgium with Moroccan roots. I am a female social entrepreneur, busy challenging the status quo of quality education in Middle Eastern and North African countries for the well being of the youth of that region (crazy idea, right ? But so needed). This is my life's purpose and I am dedicated to it full-time, without any other source of revenue.I have had luck in being one the only finalist selected to attend the Parisoma Accelerator Programme this September 2016 for three months to complete another part of my business planning phase as well as build a prototype in San Francisco, the city of success.Acceptance Letter at Parisoma/The Tarmac:  http://issuu.com/khadijahamouchi/docs/tarmac_sf_-_support_letter_for_khad/1Leading a happy hopeful modest lifestyle in Berlin, I have no financial means to afford the surrounding cost of the programme (airfare, rent and food/travel expenses). The Programme has advised me to budget for 12k$ for the three months. I am looking for generous hearts and minds who would want to support me, an Arab woman, to get SEJAALs purpose to the most powerful entrepreneurial place in the world to bring the best to Arab Youth.PROJECT SUMMARY:A large majority of young people aged 18 to 30 of Middle Eastern and North African Countries have suffered an unequal education system that has failed to educate, nurture, and upskill them in an attractive manner. SEJAAL believes young Arabs have the non-negotiable right to enjoy learning and professional development in a manner they frantically engage with: scrolling left and right, up and down through a screen on social media apps. SEJAAL is a free web-based mobile app that provides up-to-date learning content in Arabic, French, and English related to the five growing industries in the region to prepare the current generation to sustain the new economies (Oil, Gas and Petrochemicals, Banking and Finance, IT, Electronics and Communications, Government/ Civil services/ Utilities, Education/ Academia). SEJAAL plans to function like a social media with a common wall of quality learning content provided by many existing platforms, which is internally channelled, aggregated, and distributed through a thematic board menu. Sounds, exciting right ?Follow the project on Facebook and Twitter, so that I can keep you informed : https://www.facebook.com/SejaalOfficial/@SEJAALOfficialWHAT I HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR:I am currently incubating the idea in Berlin at the Do School Innovation Lab (I received a scholarship :-) ):  http://thedoschool.org/blog/future-of-work/sejaal-an-education-awakening-in-the-mena-region/I won the African Entrepreneurship Award (25k$) - Most intra-preneurial business idea - to be used for the construction of the platform only.And.....I managed to get selected onto a highly selective Entrepreneurial hub in the world, San Francisco to build SEJAAL's first prototype and solidify its buisness model based on big data.TIMELINE:MAY 2016  August 2016: Incubation period in BerlinSeptember 2016 - December 2016:Building a prototype in San FranciscoJanuary 2017  May 2017:Further FundraisingFrom June 2017:Implementation PhaseHOW WILL I KEEP YOU INFORMED? :Tweet me @khadijahamouchiMore info on me at:  https://uk.linkedin.com/in/khadijahamouchi

"DeSean's big hug :-),"$10,995","$5,000",Education," May 8, 2016",184,4,IOWA CITY,IA,887000,1,1,"






                            Diana Langfield-Speer
                            
                            
                                                           
IOWA CITY, IA                                





                        My name is Diana. I work in the Iowa City school district, and have for many years.Eight years ago, a cheerful &vibrant student named DeSean Martin came into my life. Over time, I began to know DeSean on a deeper level than simply classroom interaction, and started to communicate on a regular basis with mom, Carrie.Carrie struggled with a variety of health concerns, and her other son, Neiman, is profoundly handicapped. He is nonverbal and a quadraplegic. The intense level of care needed for Neiman, and occasionally Carrie herself, led DeSean to take on the role of caretaker. At eleven years old, he sometimes missed school to assist with getting his mom and brother to various medical appointments, and he was proficient at getting Neiman onto and off of the bus for school each day. DeSean gave up many childhood activities to help at home, and he always had a cheerful attititude.DeSean first came into my family when he was eleven years old as well. His brother was having surgery in Des Moines, and we were traveling there for a baseball game my son was in, so I offered to take DeSean to visit his brother and mom.  A month later, Carrie was taken to the hospital one day, and the home health nurse called to see if there was anyone who could stay with DeSean, as he had come home from school to find her gone. He stayed at my home for the first time, and immediately had a fan club in my children and husband. If you know DeSean, you'll understand. His sweet dispostion and infectious laugh make him tough to resist.By the time DeSean was in the 7th grade, his brother Neiman had to be placed in a care facility. This was a difficult transition for DeSean; who felt a paternal, in additon to brotherly, connection to Neiman. It also shrunk the family to the two of them; DeSean and Carrie.In the years since, DeSean has often been a part of my family; for a day, a week, or just a quick visit. We love him and he knows he is always welcome. However, the bond DeSean has with his mother was something special. He saw every success and every aspiration as an opportunity to make her proud. I cannot think of a time when he had reached a goal, without saying he did so for his mom. His success in school was the primary focus of her concerns, as academics have not come easily to DeSean. However, I've not seen a student work harder to push through difficult situations, and overcome barriers, than he has. At every milestone, he credited Carrie for pushing him to keep going. And she did. As he has told me, waking up for school might be difficult, but not half as bad as the hollering he would endure if he wasn't upin time for the bus! This made sleeping in or playing hooky a less attractive option, to say the least, and kept DeSean moving in the right direction.This school year, DeSean has had to work particularly hard. As a senior at City high, it was important for DeSean to graduate with his class. However, the two of them were now living in North Liberty. In order to get to school each day, DeSean now had to catch a 6:58am bus, go downtown, switch busses, and get to school. In the afternoon, he had to wait two hours downtown, to catch the only outgoing bus back to North Liberty. For a while, DeSean simply stayed with a good friend in Iowa City, to simplify getting to and from school, and in order to have part-time work after school. This was so difficult for Carrie; she missed him terribly while he was away. But she understood the importance of it and did not want to stand in his way. After some time, DeSean decided to leave work, and the easier schedule, to be back with his mom. He had missed her fiercely as well, though he hadn't wanted her to worry about him.Carrie and DeSean will always be a package deal to me. Together in their small home, teasing one another, butting heads, and being connected in a way that small families so often do. In many ways, they had only each other, and they looked out for one another above all.Last Tuesday, Carrie passed away unexpectedly in her sleep. DeSean came home to find her on Wednesday afternoon. His world will never be the same.He is with me now, and we are his family. I'm not foolish enough to think that we can ever replace the love and bond he had with his mother, and I know that his life will be different without her in it. He will walk on to the stage and graduate on May 21st, and I will wish with every fiber in my being that she was there to see him. I believe she is with him, and will be so on the day he graduates, still, we humans long for that physical presence to assure us.DeSean has reached an incredible milestone, and one that he has worked hard for. Please help him acquire the financial ability to be able to take this success and move forward. In the coming months, DeSean will need to find transportation, a place to live, and help in paying monthly bills. He plans to attend Kirkwood college in Iowa City and work part-time if possible.I intend to set up a trust for DeSean with any collected funds, which can be used to offset all of the expenses I've mentioned, plus many I'm certain I haven't anticipated. I would also be requesting assistance to help cover funeral arrangements, but the good people at Gay & Ciha have astounded us with their generosity of spirit and true kindness. I can't thank them enough.DeSean is embarking on an exciting new journey; I am heartbroken that this journey will be without Carrie, but in the same way that I know she is with him, I believe that we can join together and show DeSean in a very real way, that though his mother is gone, he is far from alone. In fact, we might collectively be the biggest family DeSean could ever imagine!Please donate any amount if you feel led to do so. This financial help will get DeSean where he needs to go in the months and years to come. As always has been the case, he will make his mother proud.

BERKELEY, CA                                




Welcome to our new We Bern Green campaign.

We The Media plan to hit the streets for Jill Stein to share knowledge and resources for the movement through the POWER of banners and attractive LED signs at key high-traffic locations around the San Francisco, Berkeley, and San Jose Bay Area, resulting in tens of thousands of views, per hour!

Everyone wants to help and to be a part of something YUGE. Yet, not everyone has the time to hold banners or to host events! Contributing a few dollars to help us spread the message is one easy way YOU can still be a direct part of this movement. Let US do all the work.

We are a positive group of proactive Bernie Sanders supporters and delegates that have donated our time and money promoted Bernie over the past few months, with great success. Now, it's time to switch gears!

Our We Bern Green campaign is excited to help promote Jill Stein for President and to promote voter registration deadlines, as well as Berniecrats for a new congress and other key information.

TIME IS RUNNING OUT! We only have two-months remaining, before we vote this November. We cannot wait til the last minute.

WE are the media! We must act FAST. 

We generate over tens of thousands of views everyday! That's 10,000 to 100,000+ views per day! And, we are ready to hit the streets as soon as TOMORROW!

We need your help to cushion the cost for new materials to create multiple new banners and to build a few new 3-D multi-colored LED light signs.

NOTE: See the main photo on this campaign. This is one of our [B.E.R.N.I.E] 3-D multi-colored LED lighted signs. So, imagine this Bernie sign but, now for JILL 2016 .COM. We will post photos and video so you can see exactly how our signs, for Bernie, turned out. And, now, we want to do this for Jill Stein!

We have had great success promoting Bernie all around the Bay Area, over major freeways, at farmers markets, colleges, public and private events, beach parties, and major intersections.

MATERIALS NEEDED:

Canvass 8-foot long and 16-foot long.

Paint: Black, Red, Blue.

Paint Brushes.

Quick-release clamps.

LED Lights 10 to 20 strings of holiday lights.

Foam Board and Glue Gun.

----------

Each sign will cost between $80 and $150.

We plan to make about 8 to 10 signs.We will upload photos and video of our events and our signs.

A portion of any additional funding will be used to print attractive bumper stickers. Once we reach our goal, we will offer a bumper sticker to anyone that has contributed to this movement with your generous donations.

Any remaining funds will be donated to the official Jill Stein campaign.

All donations are greatly appreciated. Every dollar helps: $2, $5, $10, $29, $50, $100. If possible, think: $29 for STEIN! Since, these Fund-Me pages charge a small transaction fee, I recommend the smallest amount to be $2.

THANKS to everyone for being a part of this revolution!

We recognize that our country is far from providing this for all, so every week we arrive on our own accord to demand the education we deserve.At 9:00 a.m. every Saturday morning, we arrive at Miami Northwestern Senior High, where our classroom is packed with students and volunteers who stand in solidarity as we pursue our common goal. Volunteers come from many places and backgrounds: FIU National Society of Women Engineers, FIU National Society of Black Engineers, FIU College of Education, and community volunteers.We begin each Saturday with ninety-minutes of algebra practice. Working in small groups, we discover together the answers to challenging math problems. We are empowered, and go on to share what we learn with others.The second ninety-minutes of the workshop varies. Activities range from civics, engineering projects, student self-expression through writing or other forms, personal empowerment, watching and discussing documentaries, or even general conversation in which we express our viewpoints and concerns on an array of subjects.We come to you as students, educators, parents, and volunteers seeking support so we can sustain our efforts to ensure quality and equitable education. With your contribution, our Saturday Algebra Project Workshop will have the ability to grow and continue to impact our lives and our community.We are humbly seeking funding to cover costs of the following:-Supplies for engineering projects-Breakfast and lunch to keep us fed and focused-Transportation for service-learning field trips to visit surrounding schools to teach mathWe thank you for anything that you are able to contribute.

                        Hi! My name is Maida Cervania and I amabout 7 months away from earning my BA in Art & Graphic Design at Notre Dame de Namur University.I started this campaign to help raise money towards my college tuition and, more importantly, to qualify for the #gfmscholarship.I am not so interested in people ""donating to my campaign"" as I am in being allowed the opportunity to participate in thescholarship competition. All I ask is for10 different people to donate theminimum amount so that I can qualify.$10,000 would make such a difference in my life. It won't reduce my student loan debt, but it will allow me to dedicate more time tosecuring a career in my field and planning a successful future for myself and my family.I don't want to say, ""I deserve $10,000."" Instead, I'd like to say that I deserve a better chance at obtaining my degree. I work hard in all of my classes. I ama good person towards others. And I'm learning how to socialize and present myself better in professional settings. Without that degree, I'll have a much harder time working in the design industry, no matter how much my skills have improved over these last few years.The way things are right now, every month is a question: Am I gonna make it? $10,000 would take away that guessing game, and I would be at ease knowing that my hard work won't befor nothing.Thanks for your time! And doubly thanks if you choose to make a donation.

MILLIONS MAY BE RECOVERED, DISTRIBUTED& AWARDED TO TEACHERS. NOT HELPING US MEANS YOU ARE HELPING THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN WHAT IS OWED TO US.  DONATE TODAY.My name is Thais Alvarez, and I am Florida Bar licensed attorney. I, however, currentlyteach at Miami-Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS). But, I do not work alone. We are actually agroup ofteachers who have come together to address the inequities relating to teachers' salaries.This is our story. Over the course of the past decade, the teachers' union, the United Teachers of Dade (UTD),and the MDCPS Board havenegotiated employment contracts which have resulted in the decimation of teachers' salaries.  This past fall, Septemberof 2015,theUTD and the MDCPS Boardnegotiated an employment contract which violates Florida Statute 1012.22. Consequently,veteran teachers who are to be ""grandfathered in"" and novice teachers who are to be compensated ""performance pay"" are being deniedremuneration which they are legally entitled to earn. That is, both the union and board are not adhering to Florida law when it comes to compensating teachers.  This issue continues to persistas witnessed in themore recent employment contract which was ratifiedinJune 2016. Watch this YouTube video to see how MDCPS's chief negotiator, James Haj, ADMITS that the MDCPS is NOT complying with the law. Fast forward to counter 8:55. Click on this link: James Haj, MDCPS Cheif Negotiator Admits MDCPS failed to adhere to Florida Statute 1012.22Superintendent Carvalho states that the ""Grandfathered Steps"" are ""magical!"" In an attempt to seek recourse,a few complaints were filedwith the Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC), andafter reviewing the complaint,PERCwill schedule a hearing with the UTD and itsattorney(s) to determine the factual merits of this case.We have to face UTD and their attorneys, butwe do not want to go alone.We need an attorney to helpall of us not justthis small group of teachers-ALL the thousands of teachers who are represented through the complaintthatwasfiled.  Although I, Thais Alvarez,am a licensed attorney in the State of Florida, I am not acting as an attorney in this case since I am aninjured party - along with thousands of other MDCPS teachers.But moreimportantly, even as an attorney, I do not haveany labor law experience, andI strongly feel that thishearing, as well as any additional legal attention that this complaint may require, should be handled by a seasoned labor law attorney. This is the only wayof maximizinga positive legal outcome for the thousands of teachersof the MDCPS. I have taken it this far, but at this juncture, we must act prudently and seek professional and experienced assistance.  For this, weneed money. This is not a personal fight; it is ourfight. This is whywe am reaching out to YOU. This is a fight of many. Teachers must stand in solidarity because our livelihoods are being threatened, and it may be that we will no longer be able to afford to teach. The community must also come together to help because education is the cornerstone of a free and prosperous society. Where will we be without teachers? And, there is a teacher shortage already - not surprisingly.On June8, 2016, we hiredattorney Kevin Brown of the law firm Brown and Vergara LLC to represent our interests. Brown and Vergara Firm Resume The reason this means so much tous is simple:We see how teachers are being denied a living wage.We see how the government (on all levels)has money forwasteful spending on budgetitems that do not impact education in ameaningfulway (i.e., testing and replacement of ""new"" books with ""new"" books among other waste) , yet there is never anEQUITABLE apportionment of money for teachers salaries since ""raises""often do not even keep up with inflation. Teachers are being driven into poverty.  This is a fight to demand that the union and board respect the laws of the State of Florida and invest in the most important asset in a classroom: TEACHERS.  Any amount of money donated is pennies on the dollar in light of the thousands in income and retirement benefits teachers are being denied. Please keep this in mind when you consider the amount of your donation.Your donation is an INVESTMENT.  Please share this with your friends and family and ask them to help with this cause which isone of the many ongoing battles to save education in America.

                        Hi! My name is Mat Goldberg, I am a Fulbright English Teacher in South Korea working at Naju Technical High School. I have been lucky to work at Naju Technical HS for the past two years and just renewed my contract to continue teaching there until July 2017. Living and working in South Korea has been an incredible experience. My school and students are continuously challenging me with their questions and curiosity and inspiring me to be a better teacher. I am reaching out to my family, friends and the larger community to help raise money for my students to travel to theUSA for their 2016 winter vacation.Initially, we set a goal of $2,000 to help lower the students' travel expenses. In less than a month we successfully surpassed that goal because of the incredible generousity and kindness of my family and friends. Because of this momentum and excitement we decided to set a new stretch goal of $3,000. With this money we can fully fund the students airfare and make the US trip a reality.Now that we have passed our initial goal my students and I will begin developing an educational and fun curriculum that explores famous US sites and provides immersive conversation practice. This unique opportunity will not only be an unforgettable memory for the students, but it will also help them gain more confidence in their English abilities and a deeper understanding of American culture and diversity. The students will prepare for their own trip by working with me after-school to practice conversational English and participate in a special 8-week English class on the weekends. Additionally, topay forwardthe generosity and kindness of others, thestudents will volunteer to help lead English classes for elementary students at the local library. Thank you so much for your support! My students and I can't do this without you!Help spread the word! Any donation is truly appreciated. ** If the gofundme does not reach its goal the money will be used for Naju Technical HS students to attend an immersive summer English camp in South Korea. **

                        Hi there!Go Fund Me is raising a scholarship for college, which will award ten college or postgraduate students $10,000 each to help pay for tuition! The rule is I need ten unique donors before September 28, 2016 and they will put me in a drawing for a $10,000 grant to help me pay for tuition. It would truly mean so much since college is an arm and a leg.  (It's currently 3:18 am right now as I'm induced with coffee, and it's keeping me wide awake. I drank coffee knowingly it will keep me awake and alert so I can keep studying for my NUR 128 physical assessment test tomorrow. Here is my story.) Hello, my name is Rally Nguyen and I'm 23 years old. I graduated from Quincy University with a Bachelors degree in Psychology. The reason I chose Psychology because I was very interested in the human mind, and behavior aspects of people. I loved learning every minute of it. When I graduated college it felt amazing. When I walked across that stage holding my diploma, a ton of emotions poured down upon me, I thought to myself, now what? I thought it was a great major, but I felt something was missing. I reminisced back then when I was a senior in high school, I had clinical for my health occupation class. We were training to become a certified nurse assistant at a nursing home called Good Samaritan home. During the time spent in the nursing home there were a lot of patients who had hip fractures. I knew osteoporosis was a culprit. We had to lift the patients because they could not walk and were always in the pain, some more than others. Truthfully, I did not like how the patients could not walk, and had to stay in their bed for most of the time. I felt sorry for the patients. They were confined in their room. There was an elderly person who had the kindest heart. She would tell me stories about back then. Nursing homes had moments of pleasant times. One day I walked in when my teacher Ms. Tranton was crying when a patient on hospice of hers died. Not after I cried because I knew who it was. It was same old elderly with the kindest heart. Nursing homes opened my eyes, and I saw a different place.  I found my true calling. I'm currently back in college to be what I want to be, not what I think is cool. I love to help people! I applied for nursing school and I got accepted. I was super ecstatic since they only let a certain number of people in each year. I have been selected! After my burst of excitement, I thought to myself how am I going to pay for this. I been saving up money in the summer working to pay for school. Even working through the summer, I did not have enough money. Go figure. College is expensive. My parents are low-income they cannot support me so I took the initiative myself and I took out loans.  Currently I'm in my first year of nursing school at a community college. I want be to a cardiology, pedatric , or a surgical nurse. I plan to further my education and get my Bachelors, and potentially my Masters in nursing.  Right now I'm working part-time, and going to nursing school is an obstacle. I understand most people are doing this, and I applaud you for that. It is definitely hindering me, and if geta scholarship it would help me out immensely. Even though I took out loans from this school year, I still have to pay for school. There are book fees, scrubs, steoscope, and other expenses for nursing school still in consideration. I would really appreciate if GoFundMe selects me because it would give me more time to focus on my studies where it's most imperative. Even if you can not donate, simply sharing this on Facebook or any social media would be wonderful. Thank you for this opportunity GoFundMe! #GFMScholarship Caffeinated student, Rally Nguyen

                        Welcome to the Go Fund Me page dedicated to raising funds to replace the playground equipment at Doudna Elementary School. Doudna is located in Richland Center, Wisconsin. Our Playground Committeeis trying to raise $75,000.00 to purchase and install new playground equipment for our students. The current equipment is over 25 years old. It is in poor condition after years of heavy use and exposure to the elements, and it and needs to be replaced soon.  We have 400 students enrolled at our school annually, and they use this equipment each day. Furthermore, there is no other playground or park on the south side of our community. Children and families in the area use our playground on a daily basis for play, picnics, and gatherings. New equipment will cost $73,000 installed. We are anticipating a 3-5% increase in costs after January 1, 2016. We are hoping to raise enough money to purchase and install 1/3 of our equipment during the summer of 2016. This first installation will cost $30,000.  We're almost at that amount now, but we would appreciate any help that you can give!   Your donation will help us provide a safe environment for our students to play and grow, and it will be enjoyed for many years to come

                        My students can not afford books, and they do not have libraries at home. I want my students to have equal access to books and a fair opportunity to develop their literacy skills. I will be purchasing HOME libraries for my students.I have students that are learning English and are refugees. My students come from nothing and have no English language skills when they arrive.My dream is for my students to be reading at home just like I did when I was a child...I hope for my students to have exciting new books that they chose themselves!My primary goal is to create awareness and educate people in the community of Buffalo about the needs of students in our inner city public schools. My number one concern is to spread this awareness so that people are properly informed about the disparities between urban and suburban schools and how that ties to school performance.If you can not donate, I am asking you to spread my word. It is equally, if not more important to tell the world about these children and the realities that they face.If you would pass this on, my students and I would be forever grateful. I want you to hear my voice as a public school teacher and I most importantly want you to hear the voices of my students that can't speak for themselves.Every day I fight to do whatever I can to give my students the best education and the best lives possible given my resources. I hope you can join me in this fight.*If I raise the intended goal, I will have enough for each student in my class to spend $200 on a Scholastic book order. I have 29 students, which means I will have $200 leftover. I will either use the remaining to purchase books for the classroom, or a bookshelf for a student as an extra prize for hard work.*Update: I now have 31 students.

This is also an attempt to earn a scholarship through GoFundMe, #GMFScholarshipMatt has sacrificed a lot for our family and I feel the least I could do is finally get him through school. My husband has helped lots of people in his life and even served a tour in Iraq while in the Marine Corps. We had planned to alternate years going to school, but after getting laid off back in June and starting to lose his spirit, I decided that he needed to go ahead and finish school while I supported our family.While we lucked out since our daughter has already started school, which enables me to work full-time, we find ourselves struggling to pay for his schooling. We've cut back everywhere we could but as everyone knows, college is expensive.Any money raised by this campaign, would go directly towards his Engineering degree and helping him get all his supplies so that everything I earn can go towards supporting our family. I don't have a set date for this campaign to end as he is currently going to school and has a few more years to go, and every little bit counts at every given time.This means the world to me as I would do love to be able to let my husband relax and focus on finally finishing his degree, he spends too much of his time and energy worried about wasting our money going to school instead of paying rent/bills. He desperately wants to completely his schooling, especially since he keeps getting pulled out for various reasons (military duty being the most common), but his money worries have started interfering with his studies.Any help would be greatly appreciated by the entire Roach family!

                        My name is Emily Lucot and I am currently a Junior at Saint Mary's College of California, studying Politics and Womens & Gender Studies. This January I have been given the most incredible opportunity to participate in a travel course titled Empowered Writing: Writing with Kenyan Women and Nonprofits. As someone who is extremely passionate about education, especially when it comes to helping young women thrive, I knew this was the class for me. Below is a description of the course and what the class will be doing for three weeks in Africa:In 2007, co-founders Jenni and Jason Doherty started a school: Daraja Academy in Laikipia County, Kenya. Daraja means bridge; girls of Daraja Academy are committed to building bridges of knowledge in their communities.Hundreds apply for a few select spots to receive a free secondary education in Kenya. Students in 8th grade score at the top of their classes across the country but would be prevented from pursuing further education by community norms for women and extreme poverty but for the intercession of Daraja Academy In addition to building their own futures and planning to be community leaders, students are also engaging in intertribal dialogue that offers the possibility of upsetting generations of prejudice and fear and intertribal conflict. In this Jan Term course, we will learn to engage in pre-travel studies to establish an understanding of the community context and also build our writing skill sets. We will then have three-week immersion experience, learning about the life and culture of Kenya from texts and directly from the women of Kenya. We will support local nonprofit organizations, particularly those focused on women and children, through writing.""As one can see, this trip is filled with several opportunities to be fully immersed in the culture of Kenya, all while helping these young women and local nonprofits build a stronger community in the hopes of spreading the message of female empowerment through education.If there is any more questions about Daraja Academy or if one would like to see/ hear more about Daraja Academy, I have attached the link to their home page and a beautifully made video about the Academy.  http://www.daraja-academy.org/ 

Although, I personally feel you cannot put a price on an experience such as this, the cost of this opportunity is $3,800. Unfortunately, I do not have this type of funding available to me after paying for another year of school, which is why I am asking anyone who is willing to contribute whatever they feel comfortable and are able to give. My current goal is to raise, hopefully, $3,000, which will cover around 80% of the cost to go. Hopefully with some help, I will be able to leave the United States for the first time, become exposed to a new culture, help young women in any way possible, and continue to ignite my passion for such work. Thank you in advance for your consideration of acontribution whether it be a dollar amount or simply a wish of good luck, as it is much appreciated!

                        My name is Sandra Adeyemi and I need your help to start off my senior/final year at The University of Maryland, Baltimore County.Ever since my parents divorced in 2006, majority of the financial responsibilities for my siblings and I (4) have been on my mother. Three of us are now in college and although we do receive some financial aid from the government it is still not enough to cover all of our educational expenses, hence why we still need to pay out of pocket.In August 2014, I took a semester off my university to attend a community college (2 year college) with the hopes of being able to pay my debt off but was unable to. I was able to return to my University In January after begging the school authorites to let me in. Right now I have exhausted all means of physical help on my part.My proposed graduation date with a B.A Degree in Psychology and a Concentration in Biopsychology is May 2016. However, if I do not pay at least $5,000 by next wednesday [September 9] which is the last day for registeration I cannot enroll for classes this semester pushing my graduation to December 2016/ May 2017. The total balance due is actually $11, 828 but im hoping with $5,000 I can beg my way in and pay off the rest while enrolled.I have been reluctant and hesistant to start this campaign because I do not know how nor am I used to asking people for help, but any help right now would be GREATLY appreciated. No donation is too small and will let my school know that I am serious about my degree and even if you cannot donate, your prayers & sharing this campaign will be appreciated as well !!!Below is a screenshot of all the classes and grades I have already taken. I only need 29 credits left in order to graduate.I pray that God will provide for you to be able to help me fund my first semester of my last year in college ! God bless you all.<33

ASHBURN, VA                                




PLEASE HELP US PRESERVE A PART OF LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA HISTORY!!While the picture above may not look like much today, this building was once an incredibly important place for African American children to obtain an education in Loudoun County, Virginia. In 1870, Loudoun Countys first public schools opened with the stipulation that white and African American students would have separate facilities. This one room frame building, heated only with a wood stove, was one of nine schools established for African American students in Loudoun County. The school operated from around 1892 to the late 1950s (several years after the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education) until Virginia schools were fully integrated. The school, called the Ashburn Colored School, had only one teacher who would try to make the best use possible of the facility to educate students who ranged in age from 6 years old to 17 years old. It was difficult at times with no central heating or plumbing but it was a second home for the students who attended. Yvonne Neal, who is 82 now, attended the school from 1938 until 1945 and described how her father would sometimes have to carry his children on his back in the winter for part of their 2.5 mile walk to school, as buses were not available. Read her story here .HELP RESTORE THIS SCHOOLHOUSE!We are a group of middle and high school students at Loudoun School for the Gifted  (a small private school for grades 6 through 12 in Ashburn, VA). We cant do this alone, and we need our community and those who want to preserve important parts of our history to help us. We want to bring this important building back to life so the public can visit it, and reflect on the past but also see how far education has come since then. Given the schoolhouses current condition, there is a lot of work to be done. We have met with experienced restoration contractors and have decided to begin with stabilizing the exterior before we move to the interior. The cost to stabilize and restore the exterior will be approximately $35,000. The total restoration will cost about $100,000, which is a really ambitious goal for secondary school students, so we need your help. We would greatly appreciate any contribution you can make, even if it is connecting us with others who would make a contribution. And, if you have ideas for the restored schoolhouse, please share those as well.UPDATEThrough various fundraising activies, we have been able to raise the first $19,000 needed to rebuild the foundation - thank you to everyone who contributed!Now we are moving on to phase two which includes restoring the original windows, and repairing and painting the clapboard siding. We have quotes for phase two which total approximately$14,000, so we have adjusted our campaign goal to reflect this.Phase three will be the interior and will begin after we finish stabilizing and weather-proofing the exterior.Framers Projects is a501(c)(3) organization that we formed to support the efforts of our students to save the Ashburn Colored Schooland we will happily send you a receipt for tax purposes!Keep Up-to-Date with Our Project!Find us on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/AshburnOldSchool Also track our progress on our website at: http://www.loudounschool.org/oldschool Read local newspaper articlesabout this project:* Loudoun Now article:Old Ashburn Schoolhouse Restoration Begins* Washington Post article:While building a modern school, Va. students hope to save a historic one * Loudoun Times Mirror article:Students work to save historic Ashburn schoolhouse

                        A little about me: I am the founder of a timebank in St. Louis, MO called Cowry Collective .  I am also the mother of two children who were birthed at home. My firstborn, my daughter, Ani Nubia was born after 72 hours of labor and my son Siddhi Soleil, was birthed in water after 12 hours of labor. Since experiencing the liberating births of both of my children in the peaceful quiet of my own home with the assistance of midwives, doulas and loved ones, I have had a growing passion for improving birth and maternal health outcomes primarily for women of color and Black women in particular. I even started a blog on Black women's maternal health after my daughter was born! This fall, September 8-15, my friend and founder of the Community Birth and Wellness Center in Ferguson, MO is offering a Perinatal Doula course led by the only certified Black midwife in MO, Sherry Payne, founder of Uzazi Village in Kansas City. During this eight day training I will become certified as a birth and post-partum doula, a childbirth educator, a peer breastfeeding counselor and a contraceptive counselor. It is rare that such a comprehensive, culturally-sensitive training is offered in St. Louis so I am seizing this beautiful opportunity!I have recently become more and more interested ina careeras an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and this training is the first step in accomplishing my career goal. I am elated that I will soon be able to offer support to low-income and Black mothers and babies as they navigate the rewards and challenges of establishing a healthy breastfeeding relationship. First foods can shape the life of a human in significant ways!At a time in our country where there continues to be debate over the worth of Black lives, I am honored to be following my heart and talents into a career which asserts the significance of Black lives right from the beginning! $1100 assistance is requested to pay for the $900 Perinatal Doula course + $200 in coursebookswhich I will continue touse to establish a small lending library for other doulasin St. Louis. My fundraising lifeline is September 15, 2016 so that I can make my payment in full to receive my certication(s).  Will you support me in living out a dream of mine to greet babies and newly-mademothers - to assert the value of Black babies and mothers lives today? Your support will immediately touch our newest generation of fellow humans. I am so, so honored to be on this path! With Gratitude,Chinyere

                        Hello! We are Jon and Nikki Pinney In March of 1999, we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl who we named Taylor Nikol.(Steroids really cause weight gain. Even then, she was full of smiles.)Later that year, tragedy struck our small family. On August 16th, 1999, our beautiful baby girl was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). We lost our Taylor on March 19th, 2000, 8 days after her first birthday. (Taylor loved getting her bath in the little tub.)Just a year later, God blessed our family with another little girl, Kasey and in 2008, two more children, Jocyln and DJ, came to our family.(Taylor snuggling with mommy. The treatments leave her feeling pretty yucky.)During her short life, and even through the years since Taylor has impacted the lives of others. Nobody who met her can forget her. Even before Facebook and crowdfunding, people around the world checked our website for updates, prayed with us, and cried with us. (Daddy made a Christmas tree out of hospital supplies and items that were safe to bring into the room.)It has been 17 years since we lost Taylor and it affects our family every day. She would be in the 2017 graduating class of Spruce Creek High School and we would like to remember her by raising a scholarship for a graduating senior who has been significantly affected by cancer. (I have never seen so many pumps. I hope I never do again.)Our goal of $1000 will at least relieve the stress of buying books that first semester. The more money we raise, the more students we can help.Let's see if we can reach our goal by October 1st as September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. What better way to celebrate Taylor, impact the life of a student ready to leave childhood behind and raise awareness of the devastating cancers so many little ones battle.(The happy little girl.)Please, find it in your heart to reach out and make an impact. To see Taylor's life making a difference means so much to our family. Good can come from tragedy. Help give meaning to Taylor's life by helping another.(Our angel!)Thank you for helping us honor Taylor Nikol this way.Please, please pass this on to your friends and family!SaveSave

INDIANAPOLIS, IN                                





                        My name is Karla and I am a senior at Ben Davis High School. I am also currently the 2014 Senior Class President and in the top 5% of the class. I am an extremely involved individual and any chance that I get to help in my community, I do so. This June I will be graduating with my Academic Honors Diploma and I want to further my education and attend Ball State University in Muncie Indiana. I want to double major in telecommunications and international business administration with a minor in Spanish. Here is my story; I came to the United States at the age of 3, undocumented. I was raised in Indianapolis IN and I grew up learning English and Spanish. Indy is all I have ever known, and I'm so blessed to have grown up in this country. Each morning for 13 years at school, I have pledged to the only flag I have really known and called my own, the red, white and blue. Thanks to a new policy just two years ago at the age of 17 I was able to obtain my work permit; I'm what the government calls a DREAMER and currently have deferred action. I have been able to obtain a temporary license and social security along with working in the country legally. It has been such a difficult experience, not being able to do the things my friends can, and there has always been a barrier in anything I do. Here is the biggest one yet; I have been accepted into Ball State University with an out-of-state tuition. This would mean that I will have to pay $33,000 a year instead of $17,000. I have been in Indiana for 15 years and they are giving me out-of-state tuition because of HB 1402 which does not allow a student without residency an in-state tuition in any college/university here in Indiana. This law was implemented in 2011 and on top of that, I can not apply to any federal financial aid because once again I'm not a resident or citizen. The only scholarships that I can obtain are community-based scholarships that are usually worth $500-$1,000. I want to go to college; I want to go to Ball State and get the education I need in order to be successful. Please see this as an investment, invest in my education because I know that one day I'll be able to do great things with people not only in my community but nationwide. I have always been put in tough situations and I have tried not to say ""why me"", instead I say ""try me"". I know I will succeed but I need all the help I can get to accomplish this dream. I have the grades, a 4.2 GPA on a 4.0 scale. I have the leadership; Senior Class President of 4,000 individuals. And now all I need is the financial support. Anything helps, thank you so much for reading this and please help me out in anything you possibly can.

                        Hi. My name is Ella Palacios and I never thought my family would need a gofundme in order to keep us from living on the streets. This fundraiser is an immediate down payment of a fraction of debts to the mortgage. This money is needed by April 21 or else we will be forced out of our own home. We are a family of four, where both our parents are unemployed and have had trouble finding work, my sister is still in high school, and I work a part-time job during the weekend. I'm currently unable to attenduniveristy because we could not afford it. My sister might not be able to graduate because of debts to her school. If anyone can help keep a roof over our heads, we wouldn't be able to express how much that gesture means to us.

                        If you've been wishing for a way to help SandyKugelman'sfamily managethe loss of their wonderful, dynamic, nurturing primary parent, HERE IT IS!! Ezra Hankin is going off to college! He will be Pursuing a degree either in Theatre, at Texas State in San Marcos, or Musical Theatre at Rider University in New Jersey!As many of you know, several family friends stepped up after Sandy left us, to house and care for Ezra. And of course, Sandy's extended family have been invaluable supports, as have her wide network of friends and admirers. But paying for college is a huge challenge for any family, and of course Ezra faces unique challenges in trying to do so given his situation. Although he has some support available from money that his mom left him, and has attained some merit and talent scholarships, he still has a need gap that must be filled. This is particularly true if he chooses to attend the Musical Theater program at Rider. Anyone who has ever heard Ezra ""Voice of an Angel"" Hankin sing, is aware of his show-stopping acting and vocal talents...(including the judges of the Greater Austin High School Musical Theatre Awards, for which he was nominated this year!). Of course, we're not going to be able to pay for 4 years of college for Ezra (although if anyone can, please don't hesitate to say so!), but we wanted to see what we could amass to put in a trust for him to help cover some of his expenses. So please consider donating whatever you feel you can, to help Ezra pursue his college dreams! We will keep this page open for longer, of course, but anything you can give this week, before the deadline for commiting to a school on Friday, would be awesome! Ezra is beyond grateful for any help that his community can provide, and will keep his funders up to date on his progress through college! Thank you!!!!!!(photo credit to Ashley Chamberlain).

                        Jin & Lynn Learn To Swimis a book series about a child who had a dream that he was swimming with a dolphin, which motivated him to want to learn how to swim. In the books Coach Jose (my father's name is Hossein) and Coach Khan (my name is Khannie) introduce Jin, his sister Lynn, and the other kids in their group how to swim in a fun, educational, and safe environment. My books are centered around and based on the skills that my father and I have been teaching swimmers of all ages for more than 70 years combined. The techniques that we use to help people overcome their fear of the water and learn how to swim have been called magical and miraculous.According to a World Health Organization report in November 2014 ""In the United States drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death in children aged 1-14 years.Drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide and there are an estimated 372,000 annual drowning deaths. The highest drowning rates are among children 1-4 years old, followed by children 5-9 years old"". These statistics are heartbreaking. There are widely unknown dangers like pool drain/suction hazards, ""dry drowning"", and ""shallow water blackout"" that both parents and children need to be educated on. Awareness of these dangers and learning water skills will help save lives. Unfortunately, not all families haveaccess to a pool or can afford to send their children to swim lessons, and my books are a great way to help educate them without even stepping on a pool deck.I'm raising awareness and funds to illustrate and publish my first three books: ""Bubbles With My Nose!"", ""Going Under"", and ""I Can Float!"". After launching a campaign on the Kickstarter website and failing to meet my goal, I was presented with a few options. In the end I knew that I wanted to give my readers the tools to make floating easier and that meant getting my first three books done. This would fulfill my initial goal when I started this project of helping someone survive if they find themselves in the water. I'm thrilled to be working with Mascot Books to find an affordable, experienced, and talented illustrator who will be inclusive of different ethnicities when bringing my characters to life. Mascot Books has also offered to help mepublish and print my books at a much better price than I had originallyanticipated. This way I will be able to finish all three books for what I had expected to pay for just one book! They are even offering to help me store and sell my books once they are done! :-)The main reason I began writing these stories was to reach as many people as I could to educate and help them understand what they need to do to make swimming easier, no matter what their age or skill level. I have read hundreds of books to my two children over the last few years and I know that stories are a fantastic way to teach them extremely important life skills. I also knew that if a parent is reading the book to their child, they would have the opportunity to learn, so I could reach all ages with my step-by-step skill building story books. I really want to be able to help those who are having trouble learning or the many people who are hesitant to learn because of fear, overcome the unknown and ultimately enjoy being in the water.If I raise more than is needed to fund this project I will move forward on the illustrations and printing for the next two books in the series: ""I Did Backstroke!"" and ""Swimming Freestyle"". Additional funds will also allow me to be able to donate more books to children, schools, and organizations that cannot afford to purchase them.I truly appreciate you considering making a pledge. Please contact meif you have any questions and I can't thank you enough for your support!Sincerely,KhannieLearntoswimstl.com

This is a great honor as several high schools throughout the nation apply for this opportunity, but only five schools are chosen.In order for Jayden to participate, we will be in serious need of donations. We are required to start paying $500.00 monthly installments this month - then the total balance must be paid off by mid-February. The amount requested covers flight and lodging for one week in Orlando. It also covers the cost of uniforms, admission to Disney World, Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Universal Studios, Cocoa Beach, breakfast for the whole week and transportation to all activities and performances.This is an amazing opportunity for Jayden and we thank you from the bottom of our heart(s) for anything you can give to help make this happen. Jayden is hoping that this experience will give him an edge when applying for music scholarships and college admissions. He'd like to continue to study music in college with his ultimate goal being a degree in teaching special education and incorporating a music therapy component to his career.Jayden is an awesome kid with a heart of gold who is well-deserving of this gift.Donations through gofundme can be used as a tax deduction and they are guaranteed to be applied to the cause as advertised.

I believe in this cause as strongly as I believe in loving and taking care of the children we bring into the world--he had love, but no one taking care of him throughout his life. Read our story below:The Higher the Degree, the Lower the Recidivism Rate  http://prisonstudiesproject.org/why-prison-education-programs/ Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail? 18 September 2013 Last updated at 00:03 BST  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24119398 Smoody, my grandson's father, is 24 years old and will be in prison for the next 13 years unless he is paroled in 6. He was born into abject poverty to a loving but ever-struggling, often homeless mother, lived on the streets and watched violent men come in and out of his life like we middle class people watch episodes of CSI. Yet, he got himself through high school, often homeless, with A's. He even took the ACT and was admitted into UWM. But selling drugs had always been an easy route to making money for himself and everyone around him. He started selling drugs in grade school to support his family, and continued after high school while attending MATC, attempting to get a degree in business administration so he could eventually go straight. He is not a drug user. During that time he paid healthcare costs for his mother and helped put his younger brother through school in LaCrosse, Wi. He also did a lot of other crazy and dangerous stuff, but still had his sights set on an education, understanding this was his only way out. Now all he wants to do is bring positive things into his life and get a degree while he serves his time. Money is what stands in the way. Finding work has been difficult or I'd fund it myself. I have college loan payments and Nina, the mother of my grandson, works more than full-time as a nursing assistant at UW Hospital making just enough to make rent and food. For Smoody to reenter society successfully and contribute to Damien's life productively, an education is of essence. Please help support this cause, as the Wisconsin Corrections System works against these guys who want to rehabilitate, directing them to classes offered at the facility that are below their learning capacity. Presently he works as a tutor, helping men get their GED and HSED and is helping the prison librarian find ways to cut costs to bring positive and meaningful programs to to the guys who don't have the advocacy that he has. He's determined to turn his life around once he reenters society and his son, my grandson, is what keeps his eye on the prize. I am an advocate for the incarcerated, belong to organizations that help reduce recidivism rates, and know that in order for my grandson to have a functioning father by the time he's in middle school, his dad needs to be educated. Please donate whatever you can and know that you are helping to create a safer society in general, and are giving this person a chance to be an upstanding citizen for the first time in his life. Like so many incarcerated individuals, he's smart but up against a brick wall without my help. He's dedicated and plans to pay it all forward. Thank you so much for considering even a small donation. You will hear from him with a personal thank you for your support. PatWhat this amount will cover: 5, $1000 accredited correspondence classes plus books and materials through the University of Wisconsin Platteville. That's one semester. He will have up to one year to complete each class due to the labor intensive method of mailing materials. Thank you for supporting this cause. Prison should not be a throw-away institution.

Our current vision is spreading permaculture to natives and people whose land and lives need it.Our hunt began by seeking education ourselves - both earning Permaculture Design Certificates (taught by Bill & Becky Wilson), Advanced Permaculture Certificates in Designing (taught by the Bullock's brothers), and Teacher Training Certificates (taught by Jude Hobbs, with special teachings by Penny Livingston and Toby Hemenway). Part of this fundraiser is to ensure quality teaching from us, so that we may afford our road trips and entrance fees to this type of schooling, without getting into deep debt. Our last appearance was at the Indigenous Panel at the North American Permaculture Convergance, speaking out about building bridges between native people and others of different cultures.Your funding will help us afford:*Giving out scholarships*Guest speakers/teachers*Transportation stipends for students*Venue costs/Teaching supplies*Our current Permaculture Design Certificate debtWe are on a 7 Generations Journey, but we can't finish it without you.

                        Hello My name is Kymare Hutchinson. For as long as I can remember, I have had a great passionate for social justice. Last year I took a leap of faith and I went back to school to pursue my Masters in Social Work. I truly believe that this is what God has called me to do, so even though it was uncomfortable and scary I left my job and successfully completed my first year in May. But walking in God's will does not mean that there will not bechallenges. On August 31, 2016 I hope to start my final year and continue to walk in the calling on my life. Unfortunately I cannot afford it. In High School I discovered that my immigration status deniedmewell needed resources. As a result a loan or scholarship are not options for me right now.As a social worker, I hope to serve others who face glass ceiling like I have, to be used by God to build bridges that give access to those who have been marginalized.I need to raise $6,853.45, I need 1, 713.25 of that by Wednesday, August 17, 2016. This is a small window but I know that nothing is impossible for God. I also know that God uses ordinary people like you and me to do amazing things and bless others. We are His hands and feet so I am coming to you my community, God's hands and feet, and asking for help. Thank you so much to all who are able to give whether it be financially, by taking the time to share this campaign, or saying a prayer. It is all greatly appreciated.Love always, Kymare Hutchinson

SAN FRANCISCO, CA                                





                        (Video: A clip of a contemporary monologue during my senior year at S.O.T.A.)My name is Isis Castillo.And Im heading to college. I was accepted to my dream school: The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Its not just my dream school, its my dream program as well: learning theater while bringing theater into libraries, refugee camps and prisons. Ill be studying with dozens of other students from all over the world, learning the techniques of theater that push social justice issues, while impacting peoples lives. But it isnt cheap.I was accepted to California State University at Chico as well. Because I come from a low-income family with a single mother, I could have had a free college education at CSUC. But, it isnt me. Its a conventional theater program at a school that stresses a conventional education. Im Isis Castillo and Im an activist. Im an advocate for social justice. And Im an actor.English is my second language. Theater is my third. In 10th grade my mom helped me audition for the theater program at Ruth Asawa School for the Arts. I found my voice in theater. My love of spoken language has only grown as I learned English, then American Sign Language, and now Theater. I started attending the Girl Scouts when I was young, and they gave me the opportunity to work hard for an experience I will never forget: I sold enough Girl Scout cookies to make it on a trip to Europe. In Europe I met girls from several countries and my love of spoken language grew.At Ruth Asawa SOTA I found my voice in theater. I received great support with my reading and writing and was able to express myself in essays. But, I also learned about what I could use my voice to accomplish. I learned about activism. I took the first LGBT Studies class offered in a public high school in the United States. I joined the Asian-Pacific Islander Club, even though I am Black and Latina, because I love learning about the common and differing aspects of people from all cultures. And, with all of these interests and supports, I became and A and B student.Now Im taking my love of the spoken word, my love of theater, my delight in international studies, and my activism, and Im going to the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, Great Britain. The program Ive been accepted into is the BA Drama, Applied Theatre and Education. From the program: Studentslearn to make theatre and acquire a practical knowledge and understanding of how theatre-making can be harnessed to change lives and inspire new possibilities.Focusing on a wide range of practices that take place in numerous and diverse settings  such as schools, hospitals, prisons, pupil referral units, refugees camps, community centres, playgrounds, parks, and nursing homes, in the UK and abroad  the course has a long heritage of innovative and cutting-edge research and practiceGraduates are highly employable and lead the field in applied theatre internationally.I want to bring this work to my home, the San Francisco Bay Area.Graduates of this program work all over the world: Natasha Bergg (2011) co-founded Theater Troupe, which works with young people who have acute and complex mental health needs in South London; Kate Buffy (2013) whose theater company Phosphorous Theater, works withyoung men who are refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia and Albania to tell their stories of life as refugees in the UK using film, comedy, music and movement; and Lauren Sale(MA Applied Theatre  Drama in the Community and Drama Education 2011) is the Education Director at Florida Repertory Theatre in Fort Myers, FL. In this role, Lauren directs the Theatre for Young Audience Series, teaches classes and camps, and has recently instituted a Teen Youth Advisory Board to provide a platform to explore leadership with teens. These are some of the alumni in the community who I am inspired by.I know its going to take all kinds of effort to attend and graduate, but I know it can be done. My Mom tried 10 times to attend college before her 11th try ended with her earning a BA in Psychology. Shes backing me for this venture. In my senior year I worked with staff at my school to apply for scholarships. I was awarded the Joan-Marie Shelley Scholarship from the United Educators of San Francisco (UESF) scholarship for $5,000. Ill be applying for more scholarships as I go through school. My mother and I went through three rounds of revisions with my FAFSA application. I qualified for $59,457 in loans for my first year. Its enough money for me to attend for one year but it will place my mother in a difficult financial situation. Id like to take some of the pressure off her, so Im fundraising on my own, too.

Skerries Educate Together NS and Parents' Association are delighted to announce an exciting fundraiser taking place on Thursday 26th and Friday 27th May. The school will be embarking on a Virtual Cycle around the coast of Ireland and we need you to jump on and help us. The aim is to get the children moving, have fun, and raise funds for vital IT equipment for our school. Our overall goal is to raise 35,000 from a range of sources over the coming year. This will ensure each classroom has the equipment needed to support the children's learning. To kick-start the fundraising process, we aim to raise 15,000 from the Virtual Cycle, which would enable the school to buy two new interactive white board/projector packages.A virtual cycle is a lot easier than it sounds. We will be setting up exercise bikes in the hall on the above dates and each class will have a set distance to complete either on the exercise bikes (for senior school children) or on their own bikes, scooters, or on foot (for the younger children).  The distances set per class will relate to part of a coastal route around Ireland e.g. a total class distance equal to cycling from Skerries to Laytown for a Junior Infants class; for 6th class a class total equal to cycling fom Ardara in Donegal to Ballycastle in Mayo.Any children who do not wish to take part in the activities will be encouraged to research some interesting facts about the places of interest along their route instead. They can then read this out to the class when they are completing their section of the challenge. This way everyone gets involved!Pupils have been issued with yellow sponsorship cards, and there will be a prize for the class that collects the most. There will be a Fun Day in school the on Friday 17th of June for all the children, to thank them for their hard work. It is up to each child's guardian to give permission to their child to fundraise outside their own home. Money raised can be handed into the class teacher on the Fridays leading up to the event.Parents are also invited to help with clocking up the kilometres, by completing a 40 minute cycle. The school will remain open on Thursday 26th May from 5-9pm, and will open early, at 7.30am on Friday 26th May to facilitate parental involvement. As time-slots will be allocated in advance, please speak to a member of the PA committee toregister your interest in participating. Sponsorship cards will be given to all participating adults. However, wewould also appreciate if you could send our GoFundMe.com weblink to friends, colleagues and family members, to encourage widespread support for all participating cyclists, students and adults alike. All donations would be extremely gratefully received, whatever their size. And if you work for a company with a Corporate Social Responsibility programme, perhaps you could present this campaign to them as a good cause for investment.If you do wish to donate online and you have a child/children in the school, please post a comment when completing the payment, mentioning their class teacher's name, to enable us to add your donation to their class' fundraising tally.There will be more information coming soon on the school website,  http://www.skerrieseducatetogether.ie/

We hope you will all get involved!The Virtual Cycle Committee

                        Remember when you werein high schooland had to do that intense research paper? Remember how yougave up your Saturday to catch a bus to the local library? Remember how you used the card catalog and Dewey Decimal System? Remember how it took you the entire day to gather all the information you needed? Remember when the internet made this whole routine a thing of the past? When we were in school, education meant searching for and memorizing information. Today, education means learning how to filter and utilize the information that is so readily available atourfinger tips. The problem arises when the technology that provides said information at the ends ofsaidfingers is not accessible. Cosumnes Oaks High School isaskingfor your help in meeting the technological demands of our 21st century students. Our goal is to have one Chromebook Cart (containing 36 Chromebooks each) per department (i.e. Math, English, Science, etc.). In addition, we would like to add two additional carts that can be checked out of our school library whenthe department'scart is already being used by anotherteacher. Our hope is that these technological assets would be fully in place entering into the 2017-2018 school year. Please partner with us as we make sure we have the technology to ensure thatevery student is learning in every classroom, in every subject, every day.

Hey there, I'm Gustavo (James) Palomares!!!#gfmscholarship $10,000 scholarship I am an aspiring actor/dancer/musical theatre performer currently studying at AMDA (American Musical and Dramatic Academy) in Los Angeles. I am 19 years old, and while originially from CA, I spent the last 8 years of my life in and around Salt Lake City, UT. I am looking to raise money to continue my sophomore year here at AMDA; to continue training, and pushing myself every single day to learn the skills that will make me successful in this, one of the hardest, industries in the world. I am trying to win the Go Fund Me $10,000 scholarship, which would help me so much in my goals at school. All the money will go towards my tuition, as I am an RA on campus and have taken those steps in order to obtain free housing. I also have a job at my school, and will have that money to make most school related purchases, and personal. The cost of this school is expensive, but with the difficulty of the business, the training I have received here, even after just a year, is PRICELESS. I will need the money prior to starting this next year of school (Fall semester starts in October).This means everything. My art, the ability to be able to effect people with my interpretation of stories, is everything to me. I love all aspects of the theatre/music/dance world, and have pushed myself since starting my education here to develop all aspects of my craft, and help create a stronger artist in myself. I have tried different paths in my life, trying to find something else that gave me the same drive, that required all of me and took extreme passion. But no matter where I looked, this is all I truly wanted to do. I love being able to make people smile, laugh, cry, connect with their fellow men, even if just for a two hour show.I thank everyone whose read this, truly, from the bottom of my heart. Even if you're not able to help out, i'm glad you could at least read into a bit of my story, and support it! Any kind of help is extremely appreciated, thank you again! I won't be able to do this without you!

                        Hello everyone, my name is Santiago. We have a grade school program in Ecuador, South America in a small rural town called ""Las Maravillas"". This zone has tropical climate and its main commerce comes from agriculture. Oranges, cacao and passion fruit are the main products from the area. In 1994 politicians decided that the local public school needed to be shut down because there was a shortage of teachers and budget.Because of this my family, who run farms in the area, decided to hire a private teacher for 6 of their employee's kids who were first graders and also lived at the farm. The next year the government still didn't re-open the public school, so we added a new grade and admitted newcommers to our school. This time there were kids from neighboring farms who also enrolled in our school.Because our school was funcitioning properly, even better than public schools, we decided to hire more teachers, build more classrooms and add more infrastructure. In the year 2000, after much insistence, we finally got the government to give us electricity for our school. We built a computer room and audio visual rooms. A couple years later we got high speed internet in the classrooms. All of this was funded without any help form government or private donations. Our family has financed this project with our own resources form day one because of our belief that quality education is the only way to better a community and provide a bright future for the next generation. Today the school is properly legalized within the Ministry of Education as a free private school. We have 82 students from first to seventh grade. They recieve a free breakfast every morning and they also have a school bus with pick up and drop off services every day. Free uniforms and shoes are provided each year as well.The annual cost to keep this school running today is 81,000 US dollars. Unfortunately over the past 3 years we have seen a great decrease in the prices of our company's products and our margin of earnings has decreased exponentially. It has been 22 years of running the school program and now we are faced with the reality that we might have to shut it down. I heard about this page and thought that maybe people would like to help out with this. Any little bit really helps.

In June 2017, Herron is taking several students on a trip to Japan with an opportunity to earn 3 college credits and this year I've decided to join the trip. The total cost of the trip is approximately $4,000 and I'm asking for funds to help supplement what my parents are already contributing. I will need the help of each of you in order to reach this goal. It would be a major help if you all would donate in any way you can. No donation is too great or small. Thank you all in advance for your contributions! Sincerely,Richard O. Gilliam

My name is Christina and I am going to school to be a teacher at Western Washington University.I have only 2 quarters left before I will be heading abroad and any and all donations are much appreciated as I still have been working hard and going to school making it hard to save on top of other bills! I have applied for countless scholarhips hoping to find a better way to pay for school but to no avail, I must be chosing the wrong ones!When I am in Bologna, I will be student teaching with a fourth grade class of about 20-25 students. I will be completing a 10-week internship while there and we decided that I will be staying until the end of the school year, making that about a 14-week stay!In order to get over there, all expenses are out of pocket. Although the tuition is comparable to what I would be paying in the states, I need to take into account the fact that I will be paying rent and everyday living expenses while working a full-time, non-paid job! I also am looking at flights upwards of $1,000! Is it with this in mind that I am seeking donations/assistance/support in any way you can. A little goes a long way and I am extremely grateful for anything and everything.Please share my story and keep following! I am excited to start the journey and adventure that Italy presents to me.

Hi there!


My name is Reggie Mention and I am truly grateful for your time and consideration ... thank YOU!!


I am a certified life coach and there is absolutely no greater inspiration than to faciliate a person's pursuit of their greatest self. It is my intention to serve as many as I can reach to help them realize the power that lies within and to accomplish their worthy ideal (e.g., goals, desires). 


In an effort to expand my reach, I am currently working on an online coaching course to faciliate a self-fulfilling & rewarding journey toward one's worthy ideals. The course will be made available online via a platform called Udemy, and the purpose of the course is to provide insightful tools & strategies to help others understand why they're falling short of their intended goals and to create a customized 30-day action plan that will propel them full speed ahead toward their worthy ideal.


Thankfully, I am able to absorb most of the production cost for this project; however, there's some logistical costs for software, hardware, and distribution that is required for me to bring this dream to life. Which is why I have created this GoFundMe campaign. 


I recently created a blog ...  http://www.YouVsYouCoaching.com ... to lovingly share my life coach training, and experiential knowledge to connect with and empower others to courageously pursue their worthy ideal. After all, the sharing uplifts all involved, right? :)


My family & I truly appreciate your contribution, and we would like to wish you an abundance of blessings, love, and light!!


Sincerly,
Reggie Mention

                                                            on behalf of Beth Rue

RIVERSIDE, CA                                





                        Hello friends, family, peers, and all of those I have never met who have been drawn to my page. My name is Olivia Rue and I am currently enrolled in The University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Unlike most students my age, I am unable to get excited about going off to college in a week, because, unfortunately I am scrambling to find a way to pay to attend. According to my social media, my high school experience could be perceived as a normal upper-middle class suburban girl. However, it was much different than that. I grew up in a typical suburban town of Littleton, Colorado, with my two sisters, a mom and a dad. From the time I was very young, I was promised that if I worked hard, I would be allowed to attend any college where I was admitted. However, because of events that I had no control over, that is not what happened. In the summer before my sophomore year of high school, my father unexpectedly left my family. From that day on, he has been neglecting fatherly duties which include, providing financial and emotional support. Later that same year I was faced with an unimaginably life changing event. On December 13, 2013, at Arapahoe High School, an eighteen year old boy made a decision to not only end his life, but fellow student Claire Davis precious life, as well. Being directly affected by a school shooting has immensely impacted my life today, I have been able to truly value life more as each day passes. It has been a difficult healing process but I took the words of Claire Davis father, to choose to love. As I was trying to heal from my father abandoning us and being involved in the school shooting, another tragedy occurred. The following year, my friend took her own life. At that point in time I was became unable to recover from all these life changing events. My grades began to drop and I was slipping down a hill of a deep depression. As I look back on these young years in my life, I am proud of how far I have come. Two weeks before my senior year started, I was quickly rushed out of my childhood home and moved to California. Although the unexpected move was difficult, it allowed me to focus on recovering from the tragedies life has thrown at me. I was able to work hard towards my goal of attending a four year university and I am honored to say that my Senior year GPA was a 3.9, and I was admitted to a respectable, four year university. I thought that my father would contribute to the tuition as he has for my older sister, but he refuses.As the next school year fastly approaches, I am struggling to stay on the road I paved for myself and not be a victim of what has happened in my life. My mom and I applied for all possible loans, but because of my father's actions, my mothers credit score was not good enough to qualify for a parent loan for me. I qualified for a small loan and will use that but it is not enough to cover my tuition. If I am able to go to school, I plan to get a job when school starts and also to apply for all work-study options as well as Teach for America to help cover my future tuition.  I am determined to pursue a life dedicated to helping other children. My dream is to become either a social worker for children in inner city schools or an elementary teacher for children who have no adults standing by them. I know that other people have much bigger problems than not being able to go to a four year college, and I do not expect something for nothing. I will dedicate my life to helping others if I am able to attend college. I made this Go Fund Me page because I do not want any past events or people to define my future. I do not want to be a victim. I want to take control and live the life that I have imagined. Even a little financial support for my future endeavors is a lot for me at the moment.

                        I am the reading specialist at an elementary school in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The students that come to school each day are facing tough odds, as 100% of the population is surviving below the poverty line. This is a new position for the school, as we are working hard to foster a love of reading, while improving reading skills to raise test scores and of course to allow for greater success in life. Part of encouraging students to get excited about reading is having many high interest, quality books. Often students need to be taught how to take care of their materialsand the best way to keep the books in a safe place is to provide them with a special bag. These book bags serve two purposes; books are protected going to and from school as well as students feel special having their very own bag. This small gesture will mean so much to the students at my school, as they rarely receive any materials that are brand new. By giving a book bag to each student, they will feel special, which will have positive impacts on their self esteem and their overall association with learning to read!

"Send a Monarch Butterfly to Mexico,$915,"$2,000",Education," December 30, 2015",24,9,CHAMPAIGN,IL,216000,1,5,"

CHAMPAIGN, IL                                





                        We are excited to initiate a fundraising event to send a monarch butterfly fromCentral Illinois, along with the person who found her as a caterpillar, on a trip to Mexico, where millions of other monarchs are spending the winter.A freakishly warm fall throughout much of North America fooled flowers into late blooming, bees into pollinating  and a wayward monarch butterfly into laying eggs in mid-November.That's not supposed to happen in Central Illinois. But it did and on Nov. 19 Champaign Park District horticultural employee Holly Borukhovich noticed a monarch butterfly caterpillar crawling near the Healey Street Basin. By that time, all of the milkweed plants in the area are typically browned by frost. Fortunately, a surprisingly green stand of swamp milkweed was found near the Virginia Theatre in downtown Champaign. Park district employees found enough milkweed leaves there to feed the caterpillar in the warmth of their horticulture office until it formed its chrysalis on Nov. 26. The adult butterfly, a female, emerged on Dec. 10  a time when most ofthe migrating fourth-generation monarch butterflies have already arrived at their overwintering sites in Mexico. The special butterfly was named Holly in honor of the person who was watchful enough to spot her. My wife, Cindy, and I have been monarch conservationists for 15 years and have made a documentary film about the declining population of monarchs. We met Randy Hauser, the park districts Horticulture and Natural Areas Supervisor, at a monarch butterfly event hosted by the Champaign Park District in August. After the adult monarch emerged in December, Randy invited us to see the holiday miracle and welcomed any and all advice about its long-term health and happiness. There are two options for the monarch: feed her nectar and try to help her survive until releasing her locally in April (the odds are not good) or get her to a warmer climate as soon as possible. A consensus of park district employees and local pollinator enthusiasts have decided that the best course of action is to transport Holly the butterfly, along with escort Holly Borukhovich, down to Mexico. As fortune would have it, Champaign residents Dave and Debbie Hensleigh operate Authentic Mexico Travel, a service that facilitates small group tours of monarch butterfly overwintering sites (Rosario and Sierra Chincua) in Central Mexico. If the money can be raised, both Holly the butterfly and Holly the person will head to Mexico on Jan. 24 as part of the first group of the new year that the Hensleighs are escorting.Funding transportation for the two Hollys is beyond the budgeted means and scope of the Champaign Park District, so we have set up this GoFundMe page to cover transportation, lodging and other costs associated with the four-day trip.While a lone female monarch butterfly won't have much effect on the overall population, if she survives the winter, Holly will lay 300 to 700 eggs on her return journey in March to the United States. If 10 percent of those eggs survive to adulthood (and half are females), that means another 15 to 35 monarchs that will lay eggs as the northward journey continues in the spring. And that means we could see Holly's daughters or granddaughters back in Central Illinois parks, prairies, and backyards next May.Thank you for considering our project. We are hoping to ride Holly the butterflys good luck until her late January trip to Mexico. In the event that she doesnt live long enough to complete her journey, we look forward to sending Holly the person regardless. Certain that the experience will reinforce her passion for monarchs, we feel that Holly deserves the chance to witness the spectacle in Mexico firsthand and will return as a stronger ambassador for the universal messages that monarchs represent.

                        I'm Mrs. Gray and my 3rd classroom is participating in a project to help better our community. Because it is national literacy month, we want to do a project to promote literacy in our area. We are from a small rural community where we have more than 75% of students on free and reduced lunch. Many families struggle with being able to drive to our county library (which resides in another town) and many children and adults have little access to strong sources of literacy. My class decided that we want to help our community fix that by building a Little Free Library. This little free library will allow patrons of our community to come and take a book for free! It also promotes others to put a book in it's place....like a redbox for books! We will place this library in our town park where there is easy access for everyone! This project will not only bring literacy awareness to our community but it will also give my 3rd graders a sense of ownership in their community by helping address a need that it faces. The money you donate will go toward our ""Little Free Library"" kit, the materials to finish building it, and books to get it started. We will be so thankful for your donation and allowing us to help better our community...one book at a time! #GFMtoSchool

Metcalf Chess Club is asking for donations to offsetthe cost of this trip so that as many kids as possible can achieve their chess goals. 100% of the funds raised now through April 1, 2016 will be used towardstransportation, lodging, meals and tournament fees for the national tournament.As you can see in the video, these kids work hard because they love the game of chess so much. Countless studieshave been done that show the amazing benefits chess has on a child's development. Metcalf Chess Club knows how chess canexercise and grow the brain, improve mental health and memory, as well as make people smarter and more creative individuals. Every little bit helps and goes a long way. These kids don't just ask for donations, they work hard to earn them, just like they work hard every day at school and chess, in order to achieve great things. Thank you in advance for all your support by donating what you can or simply watching and sharing this video. Thank you!Sincerely,Students of the 2015-2016Metcalf Chess Club

                        I'm Yolanda Quinton, proud mom of David-Alvin Quinton, who is a sophomore at Southwestern University in Georgetown, TX.  David-Alvin is a Kinesiology major, recognized on the Dean's List and a member of the Southwestern Pirates football team. In May 2017, the Southwestern Football team will be touring Europe! Every three years the NCAA allows teams to travel and play internationally. The tour will include destinations including Italy, Austria and Bavaria. This is an opportunity of a lifetime for my son, affordinga chance to travel, compete and explore the world. Sightseeing tours, educational experiences and plenty of football will be the highlights of the trip!As a mom, I want nothing more than to see my son continue to grow, learn and enjoy life to the fullest! My only concern for the trip is the cost. The total cost for the 12-day tour is $4,595 including airfare, hotel, buses, meals, admission to sites, etc. The only exclusion is lunch. He will need to have money to purchase lunch each day.The nextinstallment of $1,000 is due on December 1, 2016. The remaining balance is due on February 1, 2017.Our family of four primarily relies on one income; so, our funds are very limited. We would be extremely and totally grateful for your support. The more educational opportunities my son can partake of, the more prepared he will be to face the world when hebegins his career and embarks on all the journeys ahead!

                        Hello! My name is Nicholas (Nick) Rome Acevedo. I have Spinal Muscular Atrophy, SMA type 1. A progressive genetic disease affecting the portion of the nervous system that involves muscle development. As a result, I must rely on a power chair and the aid of others for practically all daily activities. Such as: (transitions from chair to bed, eating, some communication, etc). While this disorder has affected my life, it will not hinder my future. I will be graduating high school in a few weeks and will be attending UNLV ,University of Nevada Las Vegas. I will be working towards my Bachelors in English with emphasis in creative writing. I currently have a 3.7 GPA and will obtain an Advance diploma. This has been a journey I am greatly proud of. So I hope to advance onto my next journey in achieving a college degree.In order to attend college I must have some items to help me achieve my goal of a college degree. I must obtain assistive devices that will help me to complete my college work. I am hoping to raise up to $2,000 so I can acquire these college necessities. These items may consist of an iPad mini, wireless keyboard, possible mount for my chair and anything else I might end up needing. I would like to hopefully raise this money by the end of June or into the first or second week of July. That way I have enough time to order and purchase these items for college in the fall. College is something I have been hoping to do for years now. I have spent my entire life being told that I have only so much time left or being told how difficult it would be to achieve my goals. I want to prove people wrong and show others that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. Thank you to everyone that helps with this fundraiser. This is something very important to me. I am so thankful for the help in achieving my goals and my dream of one day becoming a writer.

                        Welcome to all! I needsome help. My goal is to start an organization which will be located in Columbus, Ohio,in order to provide abasefor mentoring toblack youth. Black youth living in urban environments have basically been foresaken. They're not being taught orpreparedto meet the demands ofan extremely capitalist economic system, and a hostile social, and political environment.Broken homes are being promoted as the norm and studies show that this leads to a likelyhood of children living in poverty in the home, higher risk of school drop outs, and children being more likely to live in poverty when they leave the home. And absent fathers, and povertyare significant contributors to crime, violence, and lack of entrepreneurship.Public schools have been transformed into aschool-to-prison pipeline.It was alittle over ten years ago I discovered that mypurpose by designwas to mentor toAfrican descendantyouth. So I am asking for $50,000.00 to acquire a building, andfor a sound system, seating, payroll for employees, and other necessary resources.When my financial goal has been achieved, I will post updates showing how the funds are being allocated.

                        Austin has been invited to Washington DC to attend the Junior National Youth Leadership Conference. He was nominated by his former 5th grade teacher for his scholastic merit, maturity and strength of character. The program focuses on gaining self confidence, practicing teamwork and public speaking skills. He will also get the chance to create his own student led grass roots movement during one project and create a personal action plan for continued personal leadership, returning home with the tools to tackle current issues facing his school and community. Washington DC will serve as a living classroom as he learns about characteristics of past and present leaders, and have the opportunity to study those leadership choices at historic locations. The cost for the program $ 2,568.45This includes 6 day 5 night stay,Leadership Home Study CourseAdmin feeand tuition and Travel Protection Plan*This DOES NOT include Airfare, we are estimating 5-600.*This also DOES NOT include airfare or hotel for me. No I do not have to go, I will not even see him as the program has strict rules on parents. But being the worry wart mom that I am I would like to be in the general area should any problems arise with Austins medical Conditions. Again I have estimated 500 airfare and 300 for a room for the week.We have applied for a scholarship and are waiting to hear back. They tend to cover 20-30% of estimated costs. I am going to get this little guy there one way or another and I thought hey this was worth a try. If there is ever a kid in the world that deserves this it is Austin. His academic accomplishments and drive to lead and learn leave me in Awe. Thankfully they do offer a payment plan so the cost can be paid over 6 months. But the first time fee is Due Nov 11th of 500.00. I registered with determination that I will make this happen for him someway somehow.As one proud Mom, I kindly ask for any help and will forever be beyond thankful for making one of my sons dreams come true. http://www.envisionexperience.com/explore-our-programs/junior-national-young-leaders-conference http://www.bbb.org/washington-dc-eastern-pa/business-reviews/lecture-and-seminar-bureaus/envision-emi-in-vienna-va-7001305

Hi. My name is Tracy. I am a single mom who is looking to live a life full of giving back and sharing my experience in hopes that it can help others. while providing a better life for my little family. I have always been on a spiritual search, hoping to understand why things are the way that they are. I was taught at an early age by my Great Aunt Rose that education is of the utmost importance. I was able to graduate high school and college with a Bachelor's in English-Creative Writing. I was going to follow through and immediately go after my Master's as soon as I graduated. Yet, life had another idea and that was my son. I became pregnant with him my Junior year, but continued on to finish school, while working and taking care of my kiddo. I graduated and decided to focus on my son until he started school himself.

So, he began Kindergarten this year and I applied to Pacifica Graduate School after veering away from my English Degree to pursue a Master's in Counseling Psychology. I am faithfulthat I will be able to finish school and get my license in Family and Marriage Therapy so that I can help those in drug and alcohol recovery the way that I have been helped. Pacifica is an amazing private school that will help me obtain my goal of being of service to others, as well as give me a purpose besides being a mother and a human being on this Earth. I have trudged through life always curious, but remaining hopeful, that someday I would know what I'm meant to contribute to this world we live in and I feel like I've finally glimpsed it.Life is full of ups and downs and it seems like part of my journey is within the vulnerability of asking for help. If you know me, this is coutnerintuitive. I was raised as a survivalist and have gotten this far with little help. Now, it's time for me to drop that wall and allow this to become a we journey.The goal I've set is just to cover the next six months of school, but is something that is needed sooner than later. I was put on a monthly payment plan that has me owing $800 a month, which is due on the 15th of each month . I have taken a federal loan, but am still short. I have had some contributions already. However, I am still in need. Everything happened so quickly and now I am finding that I do still need help. Whatever you can contribute will be so helpful. Seriously, $10 is so much.This money is what stands between me and fulfilling my destiny. I know it might sound corny, but I chose to settle a lot and be grateful for what I have received in return. This time, I'm reaching for those stars in the sky and why not? Thank you so much for anything you can give.Also, if you would like to contribute a month's payment, you can send it directly to the school.Thanks for your time!

LOS ANGELES, CA                                





Hello friends, family and fans! THANK YOU for visiting this page and for your support in helpingme reach my dreams! Many of you know how hard I worked forthis. Iam so thrilled to have you by my side on thisjourney and for believing in me and supporting my efforts of becominga world class artist.#GFMScholarship*Thank you to the GoFundMe team for creating this amazing opportunity to help support college students like me in their endevours for success.*Why I should recieve a $10,000 grant for my college tuition: My whole life, I have worked very hard to be a top student. I have had perfect attendence since kindergarten, never missing a day of school. I was on the Merit-Principal's Honor role throughout school and I have always been passionate to learn as much as I could about everything whether it be math, science, english, etc. In high school, I played volleyball and basketball and was named MIP my first year of playing. In addition to school, I have been a singer since the age of five years old. I sang and still sing for organizations and charities aiming to help those in need and I began working at the age of twelve as a professional Jazz/R&B/Pop singer and songwriter. It was always my dream to get a top education in what has always been my favorite subject which is music. Now I am proud to say I have finally achieved my dream by being accepted as a classical voice major into The Juilliard School, otherwise known as one of the top performing arts conservatories in the world. This scholarship can largely help relieve some of the large blow of my yearly $40k tuition costs. I have only beenhere for four weeks and I have learned so much about music, performing, entreprenuership and professional work. I am in awe at the possibilities and opportunities I have here at Juilliard and I feel with GoFundMe support, I will have the financial ability to accomplish even more with auditions, performances, projects, lessons, coachings and more. In the future I want to continue giving back to the world by making people happy through my music. I would greatly appreciate the tuition help and would love to call GoFundMe one of my greatest supporters in my journey to becoming one of the best singers in the world. Thank you for yourconsideration!About me:My name is Maggie ReneValdman. I am a 17 year old Mezzo-Soprano and I have just been accepted as a Classical Voice major into the very prestigious music conservatory - Juilliard School in New York! I couldn't be happier and am truly blessed to be getting this opportunity. ""Juilliard alumni have collectively won more than 105 Grammy Awards, 62 Tony Awards, 47 Emmy Awards, 26 Bessie Awards, 24 Academy Awards, 16 Pulitzer Prizes, and 12 National Medals for the Arts."" Juilliard is simply a dream come true for me. With only a 7% acceptance rate, which is among the lowest in the entire country (along with Stanford, Harvard, Curtis, and Yale), I am beyond excited to have been accepted (out of a very talented pool of thousands of other candidates) and to have been given this amazing opportunity to further my dream of becoming a world class artist. My goal is to bring joy to others by singing beautiful music on the world's greatest stages. I will be starting this journey at the end of August for the Fall of 2016. I need YOUR help to support this VERY EXPENSIVE yet TRULY UNBELIEVABLE opportunity.Going to a school this amazing does have its price...and unlike other schools who offered me merit based financial aid, Juilliard does not offer merit based aid (as everyone who gets in is super-talented) and so my parents will need to come up with a lot of money to support and further my education (which they've already done for so many years) and this is why I need everyone's help. The Total Cost of Attendance to the school for this year (including housing, supplies, insurance, etc.) amounts to over $60,000 breaking down into:Tuition and Fees: $41,310Residence Hall: $15,380Books, Supplies, Personal: $3,440Total: $60,130 (not including other fees like transportation and other supplies)This is the part where I REALLY need YOUR SUPPORT! Though my parents are behind me 100% and want to support me in every way they possibly can, $60,000+ per year for them to pay alone, every year for 4 years, is an unbelievably HUGE toll to pay for anyone. However, any amount that you can contribute will help to lessen the blow! Even if every person that came on here contributed $10 dollars we would only need 6,000 people which with the power of shares and social media is not difficult to achieve! Even if you cannot contribute with money, that is TOTALLY FINE! All I need is a share and a like so that another person may come across my page and decide to support me in my dreams! More information:In only 17 short years, I have managed to accomplish a tremendous amount through my hard work, commitment, dedication and because of the amazing people in my life who believe in me and support me including my teachers, coaches, friends, family, and more than anyone, my amazing parents. I have been singing since I was 5 years old. I have been in many musicals, theater productions and have won many competitions and received both vocal and academic awards on my road to Juilliard. I was a member of my High School Choir and Chamber Singers before I graduated with Honors this past month from High School.In addition to being consistently involved in performing since elementary school, I also love sports and received a black belt in Karate, and played on the High School Volleyball and Basketball Teams. I love to do volunteer work and through my singing and performing, regularly help raise money for those less fortunate. Over the years, I have performed in venues such as the Carnegie Hall, Disney Hall, House of Blues, BPAC, Sagebrush Cantina, Disneyland, Pierce College, and a variety of other venues throughout CA. I have learned how to sing in over 10 languages and in various styles such as Classical, Jazz, Blues, R&B, Pop, and more. I played Kate in a production of If/Then the musical by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, was a chorus member and cover of Dorabella in Center Stage Opera's production of Cosi Fan Tutte, as well as a merchant in a production of Amahl and the Night Visitors with Maria Newman. In a few days I will be performing with Cal Phil at Walt Disney Hall under Maestro Victor Vener. And on July 9th I will be performing in a Gran Gala di Verdi as AVA Artistic Director Kristof Van Grysperre conducts, with staging by Verdi Chorus Artistic Director Anne-Marie Ketchum. On July 15th, you can see me performing at State Playhouse Theater in Los Angeles in De Espaa al Nuevo Mundo: Songs from Spain and the New World and on July 30th I will be performing at the same venue in the Evening of Opera. I will be posting other venues as they come up as updates for you to follow my career.I have also been fortunate to work alongside artists such as Kenny G, Dick Van Dyke, Barbara Morrison, and more. In the summer of 2014 I won the ""Dream Ticket"" to American Idol and a 5 week full tuition scholarship to the Berklee College of Music summer program for 2015. Also at the age of just 14, I released my 1st album, called ""Craziest Feelings,"" produced by a team of Grammy Award winning producer Ted Perlman and Peggi Blue (""Vocal Coach From Hell"" from American Idol) available on iTunes and at  http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/maggierenee.  Sorry if I seem to be bragging some, but I just want my supporters to know about my STRONG commitment to my career and that it took MANY lessons, coachings, master classes, performances, and A LOT of hard work to gain acceptance to great universities and music conservatories such as UCLA, USC, Eastman, MSM, NEC, Mannes and several other great schools who offered significant and even full tuition scholarships. I chose Juilliard for its stellar reputation, its outstanding faculty (I will be studying under the superb tutelage of Ms. Edith Bers - who is the Voice Department Chair at Juilliard and who has graciously agreed to mentor me in her voice studio). At this time, I am working really hard in order to save my own money, buildrelationships with possible sponsors, and am figuring out how to make a good steady income to help fund myself, however, the money raised through GoFundMewill most definitely allow me the ability to pursue my dreams, hopefully with less debt and stress! All it takes is a small donation, a share, or both (if possible!).After hopefully getting your support, I will not just jump off the face of the planet, I promise! In order to give back to the community and to everyone who contributes, I will be posting videos onto an exclusive YouTube channel of my experiences at Juilliard and updating you on all of the things that I will be accomplishing! In addition, I plan to give concerts with free tickets to all who donate as well as private appearances for those who are willing to contribute more. I know this will be the first step to beginning my life as a young artist out in the world and will propel me into the future that I have dreamt of my entire life. After getting my Bachelor's and hopefully Master's degree at Juilliard, I plan to pursue a professional singing career performing on the world's largest stages. If you have any questions, or if you or someone you know could be a potential major sponsor/donor now or in the future,please contact me through Facebook or by email at Maggie@MaggieRenee.com and for your/their significant donation, I will be happy and honored to send out a personally autographed copy of my ""Craziest Feelings"" CD which I am sure you and your family will enjoy for years to come.  Thank you all so much for your support in helping me reach for the stars!Much Much Love,Maggie Rene

"New Braille Embosser for Natalya,$600,"$12,000",Education," August 29, 2016",16,26,ORCHARD PARK,NY,152000,,3,"

                                                            on behalf of Natalya Currier

ORCHARD PARK, NY                                





                        This is six year old Natalya. She is blinddue tooptic nerve hypoplasia (o.n.h)and needs a braille embosser for school. Natalya has such small hands and a new electronic embosser would make it easier for her to learn to read and write.Natalyas dad and I have heard many times she is doing very good for a blind child but compared to sighted 6 year olds she is behind. Natalya is very bright and enjoys meeting challenges when the technology and resources are available  Natalyas MomNatalya was born in 2009 at 29 weeks weighing 2.5lbs. At a little over a year she was diagnosed with optic nerve hypoplasia(o.n.h). Natalyas dad is in the air force and at the time was stationed at Elmendorf U.S. Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska.She is in a main stream school in Houston and instead of having a small class with a teacher for the visually impaired she will have a sighted teacher and be in a class of 20 sighted peers.Natalyas biggest struggle has been the strength and dexterity required to push down the keys of the old mechanical braillers.Brailling her name has definitely been a challenge for her as the keys are farther apart and like all preschoolers she has very small hands.Getting anew Braille writer that has a keyboard technology that requires very little pressure will help Natalya to learn to type and utilize Braille. Further, the latest technology Braille embosser will allow Natalya to convert text assignments to Braille and emboss right in class so she can follow along with the materials like all the other students. She can use Braille-to-text translation software to turn in printed assignments right to her sighted teacher.Natalya is so lucky to even be in school, almost 90% of the Blind and visually impaired are not literate. But, education is not literacy. Literacy for the blind and visually impaired is the ability to ready and write Braille. Being in school is not enough, Nalalya and other students lack the right tools to learn Braille that would give them true access to reading and learning on thier terms.The funds will be used to provide Natalya with a quiet multifunction Braille embosser allowing her to input baille to a computer and to emboss her assignments. She will also get a braille translation program to convert text-to-braille and braille-to-text thiswill allow her to be a normal student in a normal class learning normal things. The funds will also be used to help many other students like Natalya and to start an organization dedicated to directly providing help to the many students Like Natalya that need it.

"A Tortoise In Honduras,$240,"$2,000",Education," September 21, 2016",6,3,BURNSVILLE,MN,63000,,1,"

BURNSVILLE, MN                                




Summary: 
This is my son, Torres (aka Tortoise). He is 17, and a senior at a specialized Earth Sciences high school. A high school that he worked very hard to get into and one that offers absolutely amazing and enriching programs, in most of which he cannot participate - because I am not able to pay for them. 
Torres has worked a long, hard time and is now being given a chance to go to Honduras for an intensive study marine biology program. 
I want to see him have this chance so badly, it hurts. 
He has earned it, but I have not and because I can't afford it, he will miss out on something that comes around once in a lifetime. 
Back story: 
When he was two, Torres and I went to my friends graduation at the ""Zoo School"", and when he saw the students being handed their diplomas in the dolphin show pit, he was hooked. He declared then and ever since, he wanted to go to Zoo School. 
In preparation, he spent the summers between kindergarten and freshman year attending a Zoo Camp at the school. He fed chickens and cleaned large cat feces and lord knows what all else... All day, everyday, in extreme summer temperatures, and loved it. 


He currently owns 2 guinea pigs, a dog and 2 cats. His affection and connection with animals is pervasive and he wouldn't be him without an animal of some kind sitting on his shoulder or lap.


I would love to be able to give him this opportunity to pad his experience and resume for working in animals and environmental studies. 


Conclusion: Torres gets to go to Honduras, and I get to do everything I can to get him there. So, I am reaching out and greatly appreciate any and all help! Thank you all so much.

#GFMscholarshipMy name is Stephanie Rand, I am a 20-year-old college student with big dreams and a strong heart. From a young age I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I was told it is a beautiful thing when a career and a passion come together. That is truly what my dream is. I am currently a kinesiology major at Irvine Valley College with the dream of obtaining my Doctorate in Physical Therapy to help gerontology patients and athletes. There have been many influences throughout my life to get here. As Ive grown up, Ive watched my mom grow weak. My mom has a rare condition called Chronic lymphedema in her lower extremities. At age nine, I watched my mom get hit by a car and completely tear her ACL (ligament in the knee) and go through a slow treatment. The Sports Medicine Dr. who treated my mom was an inspiration to me for many years. Flash forward a whole decade and now Ive been given the chance to treat patients from the same Dr. when I was a child. Since early August, Ive been given the opportunity to work as a Physical Therapy aide for an orthopedic center after interning there for four months. It is a dream to get to work there between my current classes. Getting to this point in my life hasnt been simple. Nine months ago, during my sophomore year of college, my mom developed breast cancer on top of her other existing conditions. As a family, weve been through three surgeries and multiple complications since January of 2016. Today, my mom is in remission still recovering and taking Chemo medication. Two days after her first Lumpectomy I tore my gastrocnemius muscle playing a tennis match as a collegiate athlete, placing myself on crutches and recovery for over four months during my moms own recovery. My family has always struggled financially since the passing of my great grandma in January of 2014 during my senior year of high school. I lived with her for eight years, she spent her last month in the hospital going through a tough battle from polycythemia (cancer of the blood.) I am very grateful to have held her hand during her last breath within our home. My great grandma is the biggest inspiration I could possibly have in my heart. Many times while treating patients I see attributes of her in others and gives me motivation to truly make an impact physically and emotionally in the lives that I work with. In two short weeks I begin my transfer application process to finish my undergraduate degree. Applications for colleges are currently $55 each as well as a $250 for a hold for the schools I get accepted to. I plan on transferring to a local Cal State and gain as much financial help as I can to help pay for tuition, medical textbooks, and other expenses as I further my education. As, a young adult I have built up a savings for my future in small amounts, but I left my family with another financial and emotional burden on Aug 24th when I totaled my car outside my college the first week of classes. I am currently still without a vehicle trying to focus on my studies and transferring to save money.  Thank you to anyone, and everyone for reading my journey. Im writing this for the world to learn alittle more about myself. In return, I hope to gain $10,000 for my educational future through a Go Fund Me Scholarship #GFMScholarshipI need 10 small donations that could be from just a $1 or more of your time. 10 donations will allow a panel of judges to read my journey and make the decision if they would like to grant me and my family a huge weight lifted off my shoulders for my future. Thank you for your time.- With much love, Stephanie.

LONGMONT, CO                                





                        Nick was only 3 years old when he made his first invention. Today he is 10, and just accomplished what very few young scientists and budding engineers have: he and his 6 team members from Longmont took first place in the Odyssey of the Mind regional tournament. But they didnt stop there; this unlikely team in their first year of competition went on to win the state tournament by a huge margin. They were tasked with the challenge of designing a steerable vehicle that could hold two people, had a self-contained propulsion system and used an originally-created trash retrieval system. Now these young scholars, ages 7 to 11, are determined to compete in the next level of the competition: the World Finals in May at Iowa State University with 800 teams from 24 countries. To do that they need to raise the $3,000 entry fee, in addition to the costs for lodging, meals, and transportation. Throughout the problem solving process, Odyssey of the Mind students learn STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts by assessing the composition and strength of materials, designing vehicles and devices, engineering structures, sets and backdrops, and calculating scores, geometry and physics.These students are our future engineers, entrepreneurs, paleontologists, chemists, doctors and inventors. As team parents, we have already committed to covering the costs of the coach and chaperones, but we need assistance to make this once-in-a-lifetime experience possible for our kids. Please consider donating to the teams fundraising effort. All donations are tax-deductible.Thank you for making this dream possible!For more information about Odyssey of the Mind, see:  https://www.odysseyofthemind.com/whatis.php

BERKELEY, CA                                




Welcome to our new We Bern Green campaign.

We The Media plan to hit the streets for Jill Stein to share knowledge and resources for the movement through the POWER of banners and attractive LED signs at key high-traffic locations around the San Francisco, Berkeley, and San Jose Bay Area, resulting in tens of thousands of views, per hour!

Everyone wants to help and to be a part of something YUGE. Yet, not everyone has the time to hold banners or to host events! Contributing a few dollars to help us spread the message is one easy way YOU can still be a direct part of this movement. Let US do all the work.

We are a positive group of proactive Bernie Sanders supporters and delegates that have donated our time and money promoted Bernie over the past few months, with great success. Now, it's time to switch gears!

Our We Bern Green campaign is excited to help promote Jill Stein for President and to promote voter registration deadlines, as well as Berniecrats for a new congress and other key information.

TIME IS RUNNING OUT! We only have two-months remaining, before we vote this November. We cannot wait til the last minute.

WE are the media! We must act FAST. 

We generate over tens of thousands of views everyday! That's 10,000 to 100,000+ views per day! And, we are ready to hit the streets as soon as TOMORROW!

We need your help to cushion the cost for new materials to create multiple new banners and to build a few new 3-D multi-colored LED light signs.

NOTE: See the main photo on this campaign. This is one of our [B.E.R.N.I.E] 3-D multi-colored LED lighted signs. So, imagine this Bernie sign but, now for JILL 2016 .COM. We will post photos and video so you can see exactly how our signs, for Bernie, turned out. And, now, we want to do this for Jill Stein!

We have had great success promoting Bernie all around the Bay Area, over major freeways, at farmers markets, colleges, public and private events, beach parties, and major intersections.

MATERIALS NEEDED:

Canvass 8-foot long and 16-foot long.

Paint: Black, Red, Blue.

Paint Brushes.

Quick-release clamps.

LED Lights 10 to 20 strings of holiday lights.

Foam Board and Glue Gun.

----------

Each sign will cost between $80 and $150.

We plan to make about 8 to 10 signs.We will upload photos and video of our events and our signs.

A portion of any additional funding will be used to print attractive bumper stickers. Once we reach our goal, we will offer a bumper sticker to anyone that has contributed to this movement with your generous donations.

Any remaining funds will be donated to the official Jill Stein campaign.

All donations are greatly appreciated. Every dollar helps: $2, $5, $10, $29, $50, $100. If possible, think: $29 for STEIN! Since, these Fund-Me pages charge a small transaction fee, I recommend the smallest amount to be $2.

THANKS to everyone for being a part of this revolution!

RICHMOND, IN                                





                        Hi All,I am currently in the process of completing my last year of undergraduate at Earlham College, and there is nothing that I want more than to finish off strong and receive my degree in Business and Nonprofit Management. I have worked extremely hard at Earlham, so I hope to continue getting my education here, where I have gained so much knowledge, been exposed to countless resources like study abroad programs and fellowships, and where I was granted the opportunity to travel to New York to do a Marketing internship at a nonprofit. With this degree I plan to get into customer servicing, where I am passionate about servicing others and helping people meet their needs. Then in the future, I plan to open up my own business centered around beauty and makeup. Everything is not certain but I do feel confident about graduation and post grad.This road has not been easy, as the classes are very challenging, as well as the additional stress of the school becoming increasingly more expensive every year and then not providing enough money for me as well. In order to afford this private school education I usually end up having to take out additional loans or my parents have to take out parent plus loans in extreme amounts. Though I do appreciate all their efforts in the past three years , my parents have exhausted all of their resources this year, and there is nothing more they can do. The school was able to provide more money but unfortunately I still owe a total of $7,000 for the whole school year, 3,500 for this fall semester . In order for me to register my classes , my balance has to be Under $1000, and this is what I am struggling a lot with right now. I usually do not do this but I am reaching out to you, my family and friends, and I am asking for a donation so that I can reach my goal of $7, 000. I am asking that you find it in your heart to donate to my GoFundMe account I have set up so that I can pay this large tuition balance. If I could reach this goal, I could register for my classes, and not have to worry about this same financial issue spring semester either. Anything you can give is very much appreciated and it does matter. I thank you all for your and consideration. Love you.Sincerely,Shiyenne Talley

                        My name is Jose Cardenas. I am someone who enjoys meeting new people and sharing the word of God with them. Many times I have had the privelege of sharing in Bible study, with youth, young adults, and adults alike. Those times are a blessing to me, and it is also very special watching others develop in Christ and make decisions for Him. I am raising money so that I may attend Andrews University. This would be my second year. Almost halfway through. I am in the seminary program, and upon completion, God willing, it is my desire to work more closly with people in the church, and help prepare people for the Second Coming of Christ. The money raised, would go towards continuing my studies so that I can continue moving towards my goal. The money would be used to pay for tuition, room, and food. I have to be financially cleared by 8/15. The school requires 40% of the total to be financially cleared. That's what I would need by 8/15. I am hoping to have more than 40% however. I am also working as a canvasser, or Literatue Evangelist, and will be applying the money I've earned there towards my goal. This means a lot to me as it really is a vital step towards my next goal. To be able to enter again also, this semester, would mean I can make the most of my time, and not have to lose the semester or a year, which could really delay the goals I have. To be able to finish in a timely manner, means a lot to me. I would be immensly thankful for all the help received here. Heaven knows what your help would actually mean. Please also keep me in prayer, as I continue canvassing towards reaching this financial goal by 8/15. Again, your prayers, and financial contributions would be truly appreciated. It is written:""As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."" - Galatians 6:10 KJV

Lots of hard work, late hours, and perseverance have gone into this, but I'm in need of a little help.I've overcome many obstacles in my life. An abusive childhood, decades of addiction, domestic violence, incarceration, losing my children to the state, joblessness, homelessness.These experiences bowed my head, but never broke my spirit. I'm a survivor.I've been in recovery for over 16 years. My children are back home where they belong. I enjoy the love and respect of myself and my peers, my colleagues, and my family. I'm employed at a Social Services agency where I assist members of the community find employment, training, or education, and I was recently honored for my efforts on their behalf.My future goals are to go on to Law School, then a Masters of Social Work. I have such a passion inside to be a voice for those in our society who go unheard; to help others overcome that hopeless and helpless downward spiral. To help others find their value and their voice.My life story is an example of hope, and with this scholarship I can realize the first part of my purpose. Won't you please assist me to continue on being of service to others?Love, Cynthia

                        My name is Kenna Mitchell. I am a 16 year old home educated student via Florida Unschoolers.I chose Chineseto meetmy high school foreign language requirement for the Bright Futures Scholarship, throughFlorida Virtual School. I applied myself and earned my A so I could maintain my 4.0 GPA. Afterwards, I was invited and acceptedto participate in the Summer 2015 Chinese immersion program on the USF-Tampa campus. While I was at USF, I realized that just because onecan earn an A in an online foreign language class, does not mean theyare ready to function in a real life situation. It also made me realize, that yes, online learning is good, but to truly learn a language, Ineeded to learn it in real life situations, programs and learning environments. After the 2015immersionprogram, I dual enrolledwith USF and started taking Chinese courses throughthem. The longer I am with USF, the more doors I see opened to experiences that Ididn't even know existed beyond my virtual classroom. I was extremely honoredwhen Iwasinvitedand acceptedto participate in their Summer 2016 Education Abroadprogram in China. This is anhonor becauseI am the firstonline dual enrollment student and first 16 year old (everyone else is 21+) that they have allowedto participate in this program.I was invited to participate Friday night, February 5, 2016. Theapplication and scholarship deadlines were just 12 days later.However, this opportunity is surpassing my financial ability.I still need help raising the remaining funds by their deadlines.FEE SCHEDULE :$6,766 -Covered (by dual enrollment, scholarships and program deposit)Please click on the above ""fee schedule"" link for more information.

                                                Hi! My name is Sophie Fisher, and I ama sophomore studying Biology with a focusinNeuroscienceatBrown University in Providence, Rhode Island. I want to go to medical school after completing my undergraduate education, and an important part of the application process is gaining experience in the field. This August, I have the amazing opportunity to do just that- through the Atlantis Project, I will get to spend three weeks shadowing doctors in Ourense, Spain. Not only will I get a better understanding of what it means to be a doctor, I will be exposed to a new healthcare system, get to practice speaking Spanish, and immerse myself in a new culture. However, the program costs nearly $3,000, not including the flight there and back. The program fee pays for things such as my housing, transportation to the hospital I will be working at, andmeals. I have money saved from working jobs in the past that I will use and I am working again this summer, but I also have to pay my tuition and other fees associated with attending college. Therefore, I am asking you for help. Any donations would mean the world to me and help me take full advantage of this wonderful oppportunity that I have worked so hard for.

                                                My name is Laurie Arnold. I have been a teacherfor 26 years. I recently made a big move to another school, and I am moving from grade six to grade four. I have decided to update my teaching style and classroom. Today's children don't learn the way they did 10 to 15 years ago, yet our classrooms still look the same. I would like to make my classroom an exciting, vibrant 21st Century Learning Environment. I would like to model it after the Google headquarters. I envision flexible seating with little pods for lots of collaboration. I want my classroom to be child centered with technology at the forefront. Students deserve to come to school excited with the opportunity to create. Sitting in rows of uncomfortable desks all day is an archaic way to learn and not the enviornment I want to foster. With this money I would like to purchase comfortable seating, bean bags, exercise ball seats, small futons, bright rugs, barstools, and round tables.  I want to be able to have the option to create seating arrangements that are flexible and foster student interactions. I want to move forward in education, and after much research I feel this will enable me to provide the proper learning environment to prepare the students for their future. I can't imagine how excited the students will be to enter their room and see we've blasted into the future of learning. You will never know what a game changer this will be for my students. Words will never be able to express how thankful I am to you for supporting my project to change the physical space of my room to increase student engagement and encourage ingenuity.

                        For more than 15 years, the Community Writing Project (CWP) has offered writing workshops in poor and immigrant neighborhoods in the Chicago area and beyond. We do so inspired by the belief that every person is a thinker and an artist, that the stories people tell about their lives contain important insights for themselves and their neighbors, and that the seeds for change can be found in the artistic and intellectual renderings of ordinary people. The CWP publishes writing from the workshops in the magazine Real Conditions, which is distributed to family, friends, and local organizations. Through these magazines, local writers gain recognition within and beyond their communities for their creative and critical work. The stories they share deepen our understanding of their distinct realities. Magazines have been incorporated into classroom curricula and school libraries, organizing campaigns, and other community programs. The CWP relies on the dedicated work of volunteer writers, workshop facilitators, and magazine designers. The most costly aspect of our work is the publication of the magazines. This fall, we are preparing three magazines for publication: one from the Whittier and Volta School writing groups, another from the ""Empowering Englewood"" writing group, and a third from the Little Village/Lawndale writing group. Magazines are produced bilingually in English and Spanish. Each magazine costs about $1.50 to print, and we print enough magazines to distribute them for free within and beyond the writers' communities.We are asking supporters of the CWP to contribute to these publications. In exchange for your contribution of $10 or more, we are happy to send you a magazine to share with friends and family. Please include a note telling us where to send the magazine.

                        We are an Aviation Explorers group from the Los Angeles area that teaches kids ages 14-21 to fly for free. We have training at VNY (Van Nuys Airport) and WHP (Whiteman Airport). The kids pay a nominal fee to cover some costs for fuel and maintenance. All advisors and instructors do not get paid, they donate their time. Many alumni from this group have gone on to become aeronautical engineers, airline pilots., private corporation pilots, airline mechanics, private pilots, flight instructors and just all around good human beings. Many work for companies such as United, Delta, FedEx and more. Our sponsor organization, the Optimist Club of North Hollywood, owns our airplane, a 1974 Cessna 172 and has sponsored this group since 1951. In those days there used to be 100 members strong of business owners, sadly today we are down considerably and funds are limited. Our continuation is dependent on donations, both financial and material. We have recently had a generous donation of a 2nd airplane, from a former student, a 1978 Cessna 172. However, the radios are original and outdated and not suitable for proper instruction. We desperately need 2 radios and an updated audio panel(with installation) as well as a few other minor updates, but the funds are not available. So we need funding as soon as possible, otherwise we might not be able to keep the airplane. Please help us keep our kids flying. Any and all donations will be much appreciated. We have private non-profit status and our EIN number is available upon request. Let's keep aviation alive!

                        Hello everyone. I am raising money to finance my time at Columbia University. Right now GoFundMe is offering a chance at at $10,000 scholarship to students whose campaigns get 10 unique donations by this Wednesday, September 28th. I feel deserving of your donation consideration. All funds will be put to tuition, books, NY winter survival gear, and coffee made at home for those late nights studying.I am a non-traditional first-generation low-income student that was fortunate enough to be accepted at Columbia. I have been in New York City for about 3 1/2 weeks. I have secured employment as a research assistant with a professor in the History Department. I am more than willing to work hard and do the best I am capable of in this lofty Ivy League environment. Some of you know me, but most who see this probably do not, so feel free to skip this part if you do..Brief Bio:I attended an arts high school in Los Angeles where I was lucky enough to learn from and work with an amazing faculty. I studied literature, ceramics, experimental painting, improvisation, movement, and a host of other artistic skill sets while in attendance. Immediately after leaving, I was tapped to be a part of a documentary dealing with South Africa and the Apartheid system. The resulting film, Uncommon Ground, is out on dvd and can be found on ebay and the like, if you are interested. When we returned from S. Africa, I threw myself into my passions of painting and poetry. My work was featured in underground LA galleries, art shows, and some of my poetry was even published. Throughout my education and work I have always loved the history of people, and the story of the world we live in. How we got to where we are today. Eventually, I went back to school, majoring in history, and graduated from Los Angeles Valley College with two AA degrees, one in History and one in Anthropology. I applied to Columbia, and was accepted! So now here I am in a dorm at 44 years old. It is tiny and hot. And I am absolutley thrilled to be here! I feel like a kid in a candy store! There is so much opportunity for students here! It is amazing, and I find new things to get involved with nearly every day. I am loving my classes, the environment, the people, the city, I feel that I will thrive here.I believe that your donation will help me to become a Phd in history, and allow me to move forward and do my best to make the world just that tiny bit better.The #GFMScholarship would mean a huge difference in the number of classes I can attend each semester. Help a guy out? If you ever make it to the part of the world I'm in, I'd share my Top Ramen with you!

"Dana Summer Intensive  Ballet Fund,$665,"$1,700",Education," February 16, 2016",9,7,ROHNERT PARK,CA,151000,,4,"

                        My name is Dana Van Meter and I am training to become a professional ballet dancer.I have been offered the privilege of attending a four week ballet intensive this summer at a high quality classical ballet school. I haven't ever attended a program like this before and I know it will make a big impact on me as a dancer and as an artist. This program includes a minimum of 6 hours of dance training a day and provides housing and chaperones. In addition, the students must provide their own food, therefore it costs a pretty penny. My family has already invested over $1000 and we need $4,500 more, before May, to cover all the costs. Any donation, big or small, will mean so much to me. Summer programs are extremely beneficial to a students training. Intensivesgive the students a taste of what the professional life of a dancer will be like in that we students must buy and cook our own food, dance many intense hours six days a week, and perform in the student showcase at the end of the4 week session. Going to this program will bring me a big step closer to my ultimate goal of becoming a professional ballet dancer and any amount will help so much!       I started dancing at age 11, already late in the game, but did not begin to study ballet specifically until I was almost 15, late enough to set me back quite a bit. In spite of this, in February of 2015 I made the decision to pursue ballet as a career, fully aware of the grueling task that would be ahead of me. Since then,I have changed my entire lifestyle to accomodate this goal. My family, committed to my success, relocated to an area where we have access to better dance training, I began homeschooling so that I could fit in more classes and hours of ballet, maintaining a 4.0 GPA, and have worked harder towards this goal than I have for anything else in my life.     Becoming a ballet dancer takes an incredible amount of work. Not only is it one of the most physically demanding careers, but it is mentally and emotionally challenging as well. A ballet dancer has to have extensive knowledge not only of the vocabulary, technique, and history of ballet, but we also have to know a great deal of anatomy and how the body works in order to prevent injuries and work with the most integrity. Making it into a good ballet company is one of the most difficult things to accomplish. Getting into a company such as New York City Ballet or The Royal Ballet is the dancing equivelent to climbing Mt. Everest. My chances of making it are almost entirely determined by the training I have as a student. This program is crucial to my training. With your generous donations, it will be possible. With all my heart, and all my dancing, Thank You!

                        It hasbecome frighteninghow terrible our local produce can be with all of the GMO's and pesticides can be, then on top of it, when you try to shop organically, it is crazy expensive.This is all taken into account on top of how many people have developed debilitating diseases from the chemicals in our food, and the overall lack of nutrition in the overly modified vegetables.All this being said, I am just a single Mom, with a passion for good food, trying to do my part to make a change. I am looking to fund a Home Urban Garden using Aquaponic technology. This is going to entail converting my in ground jacuzzi into a fish pond, then using a pump, it forces the water and refuse of the fish along the growing lines. These growing lines will be built around the permimeter of the back yard. The plants then filter out and clean the water, by absorbing the nutrients, and the ""cleaned"" water goes back in to the pond, good and clean for the fish. I am lookig to use three different types of aquaponic technology including NFT systems, Media Based, and Deep Flow systems. They can all be connected and have different benefits to their use, and have varying success rates with different kinds of plants. The goal is to fine tune the system, so that we can have a basline to set up systems in other homes that are interested in setting up their own Urban Garden. The vision is to have a system readily available in neighborhoods, so that we can start relying on our own systems, for organic, chemical free, super healthy fruits and vegetables. Anything over the actual cost, not just the stated amount, would go to assist in the funding of a school project for my daughter's school. It's not just a great project for kids, but maybe they'll have a chance to eat fresh, delicious produce, instead of the ""state approved"" garbage that's usually served at lunch. (My own daughter refuses to eat the food at lunch because it's greasy and unhealthy. What 9 year old kid says that unless it's really that bad? ? )This ability would not only mean the world to my little family, but oddly enough, this small sytem would enable me to provide enough fresh produce for my neighbors and friends. It is quite amazing how much can be grown in a small system.Let's take back our health together!!

                        I am a middle school math teacher in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. 91% of my students qualify for free or reduced lunch. My students are smart, hilarious, and very motivated; however, many of their families (as well as my school in gereral) are of limited means.I am raising money to buy a class set (26) of Chromebooks for use in my classroom. Last year I taught in a technologically-advanced classroom where all of my students had access to laptops. As a result, my 7th graders had a 100% pass rate on the End-of-Course state Algebra I Honors exam. This year, however, my students have limited access to technology, as our school of over 1,200 has only four computer labs which are frequently reserved by other teachers or being used for standardized testing.My students willuse the Chromebooks in class daily, primarily for the following programs:i-Ready: i-Ready is a program which customizes a curriculum to the needs of each individual student, allowing me to differentiate instruction so that all kids get exactly what they need.Desmos: Desmos is a wonderful interactive graphing software that allows students to use virtual manipulatives to develop conceptual understanding and collaborate in solving higher-order thinking problems.Khan Academy: Khan Academy has videos in both English and Spanish that can be used for both remediation and to introduce new topics. My students and I would be incredibly grateful for any help you could give us. We will be proving photo updates throughout the year to show you how our technology is being put to use!

                        Hi! My name is Leigh and I am starting this page to raise some money for my daughter Alanna's college tuition. I primarily started the page to enter her in the contest to win a $10,000 scholarship from Go Fund Me.#GFMScholarship If she receives 10 donations from 10 seperate people she will be in the running for the scholarship.The money raised will be used to pay for her tuition costs. My husband and I decided that we would pay for her school to save her from long term debt. And while we are happy to do it for her, it can be hard to keep up with the cost of that and the day to day cost of LIFE! We are not wealthy people. We are regular, middle class folk working hard and living paycheck to paycheck like so many others. Receiving help from people like you could make a huge difference in our everyday budget.Alanna is a smart girl with dreams of making a difference with her post college life. She is studying genetics with the goal of going into medical research when she graduates. Even in high school I remember her being very ""geeked out"" about science and genetics. She gets so animated when she talks about it. And while she is very grateful that we are paying for her school she understands that it is, at times, a hardship for us. I know she would be incredibly grateful for any donations she might receive. I think it would also be inspiring to her to see other people, maybe people she doesn't even know, make a donation towards her future.We also believe very much in giving back when we are able. Alanna would very likely remember your generosity when she is older and able to help someone else in need. What comes around always goes around. Thank you for reading our story!

                        From the moment that the full moon awakened me from a deep slumber I knew I was a vessel from which an icon would emerge! Like so many greats before her, she was born into a lot of love and a little money. However, this would never stop us as her parents from teaching our little girl things that money can't buy! We nourished her spirit with love, we fed her soul with encouragement and we inspired her because we were captivated by her. She's always had a spark, a fire, that thing, some simply say ""IT""! Her happiness is infectious but her sadness brings the rain. Life never hands the greats or iconic people a golden ticket without there being dedicated hard work, ultimate sacrifice, and adverse perseverance. As the eldest of her 6 siblings (7 total 6 girls 1 boy) she is compassionate, understanding, and as they affectionately call her ""magical princess."" Although, each one of our children are gifted just as iconically ,in their own respective fields, as her they all love and admire her and each other equally. The money requested will allow for just her and all of her things to go off to college. Including her airline tickets (1 ticket to college, 1 round trip ticket home for Christmas, and 1 ticket home at the end of the school year), shipping her stuff from home, purchacing needed technology and equipment, as well as materials needed for auditions, voice lessons, etc. We are very proud of her for being awarded a scholarship by her school and we are just trying to get her there!! I have yet to say her name because once you know it you'll never forget it! So without further ado allow me to introduce you to Aryon (ah-ree-yawn)!!! ( she has asked me to please let everyone know that she appreciates everyone for helping to reach her next goal and she says she'd love if someone would pay her entire tuition so that she may focus solely on obtaining her degree.)#GFMScholarshipThanks,The Young Galaxy

                        O&M Internship with Blind and Visually Impaired Students -I am trying to stay afloat financially in quest of becoming a Certified Orientation and Mobility Specialist to help people who are blind or visually impaired with skills to assist in their independent and safe travel.My journeyIn life we get thrown curve balls that change our course, and that is exactly how I wound up becoming a college student in pursuit of this particular degree and making the decision to walk away from a job of 12 years. The curve ball that changed everything was when my son was diagnosed with a rare hereditary eye disorder, Familial Exudative Vetreoretinopathy. This particular part of our journey opened a whole new world to us. And I believe with all my heart that everything happens for a reason, and we can use it to help others. So after the dust settled, I decided to start college in order to help others like my son, along with their families.As an older student, starting college was a scary new challenge being in classes with a room full of 18 year olds. However, I have worked hard and have successfully achieved many milestones including obtaining my Associates of Arts from Blinn College in May of 2014, graduating Cum Laude. After which I transferred to Stephen F. Austin in Nacogdoches, TX in final pursuit of my Rehabilitation Services Degree with an emphasis on Orientation and Mobility. This was my first time ever to leave my hometown. I left everything I have ever known to enter a place I knew nothing about or anyone. A huge step out of my comfort zone. I live a very simple life in an older RV without hot water or central heat, however, it has been a very humbling experience and I am blessed to have a roof over my head. I have definitely learned what I can live without. It was the most economical decision in comparison to an apartment in a college town. I drive a used van that is paid for but it has needed several major repairs over the last 2 years which has dipped into my savings.Why I am asking for financial assistanceI am a Senior at SFA, and getting ready to begin my 9 week unpaid internshipin Austin then graduation in August. I am grateful for housing being provided. However, looking over my finances, I am not going to make it financially. I have been beyond blessed with the scholarships and grants that I have received based on my GPA, currently a 3.889, and service, however, they are running out including the additional loans that I have taken out. I have exhausted all my savings, and have done different jobs to generate income including mowing the RV Park, office work for two restaurants, yard work as needed, campus position and anything else I can do. My upcoming expenses include financial backing during unpaid internship, expense of the certification exam, graduation, and relocating my RV in addition to my regular monthly expenses that include a very pricey individual health insurance policy for my son and me. I am kindly asking for your assistance in funding this leg of my journey to graduation. I am very passionate about this field and the opportunities I will have to help people who are blind or visually impaired. The journey has not been easy, but it has been WORTH it! Thank you all in advance for your prayers and support in this leg of my journey! Please show additional support by sharing on your page.

BERKELEY, CA                                




Current News: Summer 2016Hi,So much has gone on this last year!I feel deep, heartfelt gratitude to you for contributing to my 2015 GoFundMe campaign. Your support played a key role in helping me successfully complete the first year of my MA composition program at Cal State East Bay. Ive made some great new friends, and am starting to feel a sense of community. Students, faculty, and staff alike have gone out of their way to welcome and encourage me, and even to help me with little things that make it easier for me.With a combination of your support and State education grants, I was able to cover all my 2015 tuition costs, and even had a small budget to hire two students for a few hours each week to help me notate new compositions. This allowed me--for the first time since Ive had Parkinsons--to have the rewarding experience of being able to compose as fast as I could think up new material! Thus in the Fall Quarter of 2015, I composed and notated three new movements of my Beauty ensemble piece--an amount of work which would have taken me over a year in the past. (I have shared one of the new movements with you below.) I was also able to upgrade several of my past scores to professional standards. Im emerging from the ""Parkinson's shell,"" giving voice lessons to a neighbor and sharing my music at community open mics. Ive been blessed with some wonderful volunteers who have become friends. They assist me with activities like typing up my papers and online research.~ In the classroom, thinking hard about music theory ~I have built a strong working relationship with Dr. Jeffrey Miller, the principal composition professor at my school. Dr. Miller has over four decades of experience in the field. Over the past year, he has challenged me to broaden and redefine my notions of composition, and assisted with long-range planning. Weve discussed how I can best maximize my learning and create a strong professional portfolio during my time at Cal State East Bay. He has suggested that I extend my Masters program to three years, since Parkinsons lengthens the time needed to produce a portfolio and Masters thesis. My personal reasons for this third year are: I learn well from him; this is an unsurpassed opportunity for me to delve deeply into composition with a high caliber teacher; and it's economically efficient, given the low cost of State tuition. However, this opportunity brings a challenge. The State tuition grants, which I currently receive, will only cover two years of an MA program. I have to raise the funds for the third year. I am taking a diverse approach to meeting this aim by applying for scholarships, researching relevant non-profit grantmakers, and relaunching my GoFundMe campaign. My goal is to have the budget already in place before 2017. This will allow me to breathe easy and put my total focus into my Masters thesis, for which I will have to create a 30-60 minute professional composition with an accompanying 50-100 page thesis. My thesis work will be challenge enough for the third year without having to simultaneously raise funds. In order to give my Master's project my full attention, I will need to build on 2015s fundraising success, in which we raised $3,460! In fact, I will need to triple this accomplishment. Will you please join me in making this a reality?Thanks for sharing this journey with me. Becoming a composer - which just two years ago was only a dream - is taking concrete form. Words cannot do justice to how meaningful this is. Please enjoy this new piece of music which I composed during the Fall Quarter of 2015.Have a great summer!Ben :)Gratitude Thanks to All!William Blake, the 17th Century English Poet, once wrote: ""Gratitude is Heaven Itself.""All donations will be received with joy and gratitude and placed in Ben's special needs trust for the purposes of educational expenses.Sharing His Joy and Passion for MusicBen's purpose is to share the music he hears in his inner ear with the world. With your help, he will triumph over Parkinsons and do his part to prove that limitless goals are never impossible in the face of disability.Help Ben Rivers DefyParkinson's, Succeed In His M.A. Program and Share His Music With The World!Locked Within Imagine being a musician sealed away in your own body, your mind vibrant and active, but when you told your body to move, it wouldn't. When you tried to stride, you found yourself barely able to shuffle. Use your hands...well, forget that. Try to speak  out came a slurred, mostly inaudible, mumble. For ten years, that is the reality Ben Rivers coped with, starting at 31 years old, as undiagnosed Young Onset Parkinsons Disease robbed him of the ability to effectively interact with the outside world. Happened SuddenlyThis condition was all the more strange because it came on so quickly: for the first 30 years, Ben had a normal, healthy body. Then, suddenly and in the span of nine months, the disease appeared and progressedrapidly.When he did attempt to do things for himself, he was liable to get stuck in a corner, his body frozen up. Unable to reliably command the circuitry that would produce audible speech, he would communicate by blinking: one blink for ""yes"", two blinks for ""no"", and rolling his eyes to express humor. Music WithinYet, beneath the expressionless exterior, he was hearing music from within. Year after year, he was etching musical compositions on a tablet only he could know and experience.In 2012, new doctors and new treatments freed him from this physical prison, restoring many, but not all, powers of speech and movement  giving him daily ""windows of functionality"" in which he could followhis passion for composing and share the accumulated works he had spent years mentally crafting.ComposingDespite DisabilityDespite continuing and profound disability including the loss of fine motor skills and otherphysical limitations he has composed more than ten musical pieces, twelve ballads and poems, performed four solo concerts, and has been accepted into a Masters program in Composition at CSU East Bay  in whichhe has just successly completed his First Quarter!Hes excited and ready to create a substantial music portfolio that shares his passion for music  and celebrates a rich variety of styles and genres - while demonstrating his unshakeable belief that the joy of living is limitless, despite the challenges that may seem to close the road ahead.Graduate School: Make the Time CountBen is keenly aware of the time he has lost due to the disease. Knowing this renews his determination to make the time in graduate school count. He's taking steps never taken before, such as raising funds to hire a personal assistant to help him with the college-oriented tasks that require fine-motor control. In short, he's proactively creating an infrastructure for success.He knows this will incur a whole new level of expenses which are currently beyond his means. He doesn't know how or from where the resourceswill come. All he knows is that he's come this far, and failure is simply unacceptable.Meeting The Unknownwith Optimism and HumorWhen the cost of a personal assistant to help him meet the motor-movement demands of intensive schoolwork is added, he finds himself in a circumstance that feels not only prohibitive but also intimidating.His response is to dig deeply into his core of optimism and humor. While he freely admits that he does not know what the path to success will look like, he also says that he finds himself trusting, a little more each day, that he will find it; or maybe it will find him?

"Keeping a Bennett Belle ,$150,"$15,000",Education," April 17, 2016",5,5,MISSOURI CITY,TX,128000,,1,"

MISSOURI CITY, TX                                





                        Ambitious, Joyful, confidence, and peace are the words that create Jasmine Denise. Education is the peace that allows me to be that spark of hope for my family. I want to be an amazing educated woman that inspires people. I had to find confidence, joy, and peace while overcoming a jealous spirit. My ambition to become the best that I can be, stemmed from overcoming that jealous spirit. My senior year of high school was a true turning point in my life. My family started to go through a finical struggle . There was only one steady check to feed a family of 7 people as well as the monthly bills. To add to the struggle someone was stealing money from my mother. So the money we did have was extremely limited. During our time of need, my parents were barely able to feed us. I didnt handle the struggle very well because I was jealous of my class mates. I really couldnt understand why we had to struggle.When 2015 started my mother had a MS ( multiple sclerosis) relapses and because of this the doctors said that she may need to quit her job. As my senior year began to progress I wasnt getting accepted into college. On top of that it seemed as though I wasnt going to be able to participate in any senior activities because my parents couldnt afford it. My brother agreed to pay for my activities but, he fell through. After this terrible news my heart broke into millions of pieces because I was looking forward to these activities. With my world crumbling around me all I could do was fall to my knees and pray. Pray for a break through to push me through and turn my world right side up. From that day forth I put my total faith in God. After this my life had changed completely, I got accepted into the Bennett College with a scholarship, and I was able to get financial assistance for my senior year activities. From my senior year experience, I learned that God will always see you through. I plan to obtain my bachelors of science in chemistry then further my education as I go into physical therapy school. I decided to become a chemistry major because l always loved science and it gives me an advantage when applying for Physical therapy school. I want to become a physical therapist because they help God heal those who need to be healed from their body to their soul. My grandmother had a stroke and I always became fascinated how the Physical Therapist who helped her walk again. Bennett has given me hope to believe and achieve once again. The same way they did when they accepted me when nobody else wanted me. I have found many Bennett sisters who support me and never let me give up. They see a spark in me that I dont see in myself which makes me fall in love with Bennet every single day. The spirit here is amazing and I would love to continue my education here in this sprit. It will allow me to reach new heights and soar to my greatest potential. Bennett is my outlet to allow the young girl that I am now to meet the phenomenal women I will become. My philosophy on life is to simply walk by faith and remember that God gives you everything you need and want. #gfmscholarship

Hola Nios, Me llamo Naomi Russell. Soy la estudiante al UMSL en San Luis. Aqu, estudio negocios de internacional con un asignatura secundaria en espaol.For those of you who do not speak spanish, I said . . . Hello Boys & Girls, My name is Naomi Russell. I am a student at UMSL in St. Louis. Here I am studying International Business with a minor in Spanish.Here's a little bit about me. I am a full time student, taking 13 credit hours, who also works part time, averaging about 20 hours per week. Completing college is a major goal of mines that has not been easy. Coming from STLCC (St. Louis Community College) I was fortunate to be selected as the recipient of theCommunity College President's Scholarship, which covers my tuition and fees as long maintain the scholarship requirements. And without that scholarship I would not have been able to afford my schooling. Which now, brings me to my current dilemma, my scholarship does not cover the costs of me studying abroad.Hoy (today), I am raising money to cover the expense of my Study Abroad trip that will be this winter, in early January of 2017. This study aboard trip is required for my major (International Business) and well as it helps me by receiving credits for my minor (Spanish). There are actually two study abroad trips I would like to attend but we will focus on this one for now. Here are a couple of links that describe the trip and also breaks down of the costs. This first one is about the trip, http://umsl-sa.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=117 45and this second one is about the costs http://umsl-sa.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.BudgetSheet&Term=Winter%20Intersession&Program_ID=11745 Every little bit will help and be gladly appreciated! I will be arranging soon to meet with Study Abroad & Financial Aid advisors soon, to see when the funds will be needed. So further details are soon to come!Muchas gracias!Naomi RussellP.S. Here are also two links of two UMSL Students who shared their Study Abroad experiencia en Costa Rica (experience in Costa Rica) as well.

I pulled you aside after you were done speaking to the seniors, and I told you a quote - ""out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls, the most massive characters are seared with scars."" After you spoke to us briefly about you and what you do, it made me think. That there are few men like you who get up in the morning determined to make a change in the community, that community being Yonkers. I may not know what you stand for, but it was enough to say that I personally respect you and what you are doing for this community, and you definitely got my handshake.

                        My name is Lou Celenza and I teach Chemistry at Central Islip HS. I switched to a flipped classroom 3 years ago. It requires students to watch videos at home and work in cooperative groups in class. However, as some of you know many of my students do not have access to a computer or the internet at home. We only have one computer in class and as you can imagine with 25-30 students per class that just doesn't cut it. This money would be used to purchase Ipads, tablets and /or laptops that these students could use. Anything you can give would be greatly appreciated.

                        My fourteen-year-old daughter, Willow, has been in love with dance her entire life. This year is her twelfth year of dance.Willow's dance studio, The Dance Academy of Bartlett, tries to take a trip to New Your City every few years to give the students a chance to see the professional side of dance. This years trip is the first time Willow has been old enough to go.The trip will include classes with professional master dancers that work and teach dance in New York City. It will also include going to Broadway shows, seeing the Rockettes, ice skating, tours, site seeing, and much more.We have been working over the last year to gather the money for the trip. We have fund raised through the studio and set aside at home. Willow has saved all of her dance assisting pay at the studio. We still need some help.So now I am asking all my friends and extended family to chip in. Any little bit can help.The trip's total cost will be about ~$2,200 for each student. That cost covers hotel rooms in Manhattan, all the tickets to the shows, all the class fees, airfare, and transpiration while there, and the split cost of the teachers that are going as chaperones. One of the teachers that are likely to go is one of Willows adopted aunts, I trust her completely. Parents are not allowed to go. Beyond the trip cost, Willow will need to take money for food and souvenirs.The first payment installment is due on September 30th. Because that is when the nonrefundable airfare will be purchased it is the make or break point to decide if Willow can go.This trip would mean a lot to us and Willow cant go without a little help. She will not get another opportunity like this for at least three years.This is a great opportunity for her we really want her to go.Thank you.

MAMA Reporting Services is a non profit program offering martial arts as an alternative to the streets. That's more time in a structured and disciplined environment. Less time on the street. More time surrounded by positive peers and mentors. Less time around a potentially criminal element. More contact time with adults. Less opportunity for poor decision. More opportunity for success!Change the environment, Change the child!!Our fundraising purpose is to create scholarships for at-risk teens and youth in the Omaha and surrounding metro to partake in a martial arts program.
