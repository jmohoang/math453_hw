When that check is cashed, the destruction left behind is almost beyond description. Behind every soldier serving in our military is a family whose love and support makes their complete and unwavering commitment to this country possible. When those families receive notification that a husband, father, or son are gone, they need all that love and support given right back. Since retiring from the military its been a persistent and painful struggle to watch the fight from the sidelines. Even though I can't physically go overseas and contribute, I refuse to sit back and do nothing. Ive decided to put it all on the line to support the Navy SEAL community and their families who live with their toes on the line everyday.My goal is to set four world records in one jump to raise 1 million dollars to fund the Navy Seal Foundation Survivor Support Program for 2016. The Navy SEAL Foundation exists to preserve the legacy of fallen heroes, and to support the families of those who have sacrificed more than anyone should be asked to. The Foundations programs encompass survivor support, tragedy assistance, legacy preservation, warrior support and educational opportunities and are only made possible through the donations of grateful Americans.Throughout my military career I met countless people from all over the United States who were deeply and graciously thankful for those serving on their behalf. Almost all asked if there was anything they could do to help. If you are one of those people, this is an opportunity to get involved. If you want to make a real difference and help preserve the living legacies of fallen heroes I encourage you to visit the Navy SEAL Foundation website:  http://www.navysealfoundation.org/to learn more about their programs, impact, and the community they are dedicated to support.

Upon starting this journey i didn't expect word about the actions i was taking to spread as much as they have but boy was i wrong.Due to the demand for my visits as Spider-Man becoming more evident, I created a Non-Profit foundation Called ""Heart Of a Hero"" to ensure that i could keep the smiles, encouragement, and inspiration for these children going. The visits themselves brighten the faces and spirits of each and every child i have come in contact with and i am proud to say that i have fallen in love with bringing joy to these little heroes as spidey.Obviously none of this is free on my behalf but each visit is free for all underprivileged/sick children. In addition to my visits i also come baring gifts such as spider-man masks, toys, blankets, pillows, coloring books, crayons, honorary hero medals and so much more. This is where the donations become VITAL to this cause. Also, the suits i own are very expensive and require not only constant maintenance but also replacing from time to time. With the YOUR help and the help of the community, i can continue to make visits possible. Any donation amount helps BIG TIME and is very much appreciated. Due to the constant need for donations to keep things going, this go fund me page will remain open.To get more in depth info on HEART OF A HERO and follow spider-man on EVERY journey visit the following links below! thank you -Ricky Mena www.HeartOfaHero.org www.Facebook.com/HeartOfaHero+ Read More"

It is so rare, that he and his cousin are the only persons in the United States, diagnosed and still alive, with this disease.Kris's brother, Kyle, passed away in December 2015as a result of this disease. His father, Uncle and Grandmother also suffered and passed away with this same disease. When his Grandmother, Shirley died, this disease was not discovered thru her autopsy, as medical testing was not progressed enough to know what to look for.Kris's father, Michael andKris's Uncle David donated their lives to the core research at IU Medical Center. Thru their autopsys,the genetics were unveiled and it was then determined they had a neuroserpin brain disease, FENIB.Kris has early onset dementia, seizures, myoclonis epilepsy and frequent falls. He needs constant supervision. His prognosis is grim. It is my desire to keep him at home as long as possible. In order to accomplish this, I need funds to pay for caregivers who canhelp me care forhim. I cannot do this alone.This financial need is URGENT and needed now. My posted goal is hoped to be enough to pay caregivers for 6 months.Please help me keep my promise to my son - that he will die peacefully in his own home and will not have to live in a facility.I am most thankful and grateful to anyone who can help, no matter how big or small!Description of FENIB:""FAMILIAL ENCEPHALOPATHY WITH NEUROSERPIN INCLUSION BODIESis a progressive disorder of the nervous system that is characterized by a loss of intellectual functioning (dementia) and seizures. At First, affected individuals may have difficulty sustaining attention and concentrating. Their judgement, insight and memory become impaired as the condition progresses. Over time they lose the ability to perform the activities of daily living, and most people with this condition eventually require comprehensive care.The signs and symptoms of FENIB vary in their severity and age of onset. In severe cases, the condition causes seizures and episodes of sudden-involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) in addition to dementia. These signs can appear as early as a persons teens. Less severe cases are characterized by a progressive decline in intellectual functioning beginning in a persons forties or fifties.Mutations in the SERPINII gene cause FENIB. The SERPINII gene provides instructions for making a protein called neuroserpin. This protein is found in nerve cells, where it plays a role in the development and function of the nervous system. Neuroserpin helps control the growth of nerve cells and their connections with one another, which suggests that this protein may be important for learning and memory. Mutations in the gene result in the production of an abnormally shaped, unstable version of nueroserpin. Abnormal nueroserpin proteins can attach to one another and form clumps (called neuroserpin inclusion bodies or Collins bodies) within nerve cells. These clumps disrupt the cells normal functioning and ultimately lead to cell death. Progressive dementia results from this gradual loss of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. Researchers believe that a buildup of related, potentially toxic substancesin nerve cells may also contribute to the signs and symptoms of this condition.""+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

They work so hard, against all odds, and they're often burnt out and exhuasted. They don't have the opportunity to practice very much self-care.In our initial needs assessment, we've seen that there is a strong need and desire to be introduced to self care practices. We personally know the transformative power of yoga and meditation, and this is what we will share.We're going tospend October and November in Armenia running a pilot project where we introduce yoga and meditaiton to this community.There's been so much enthusiasm and positive energy around this project, and we're committed to making it work. We've already had multiple Skype meetings with change makers in Armenia to assess actual needs and gauge responsiveness. We've been building many facets of the project and are now ready to launch it publicly. We can't do this without the support of our community though, and so, we turn to you.Whatever you can contribute will fund travel (to and within all the regions of Armenia), accommodations, and all project related expenses for two months.We do not plan on charging participants for the initial stage of this project so whatever we raise is what have to work with.We promise to keep all our supporters updated on our progress before and during the implementation of our project.Thank you so much to all the support thus far, and we look forward to keeping the good news coming!With gratitude and love,Armen & Hasmig                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

As most of you know I am a suicide attempt survivor and have spent the last few years speaking publicly about my story in the hopes of helping others personally, and as part of a community to help bring awareness to a still growing tragedy. Unfortunately, for this trip my expenses aren't funded and I don't have the money to go. Please support the cause, by donating to this fund and making it possible for me, in this once in a lifetime opportunity, be the voice at this event for those still suffering & for those that are no longer with us! Many of us have been effected one way or another by suicide, whether it was a family member, a friend, a neighbor...we can do something to stop others from experiencing this. We might not be able to travel to such a public place and speak our passion about it ourselves, but we can help by supporting those who can. One thing that has been reaffirmed strongly through my experience, is that we can't do it alone, but TOGETHER we can! This is just a guess at the amount I'll need...& the date is really close, so I need to collect the funds as soon as possible.Thank you VERY much for any contributions big or small!The funds will be used for:AirfaireHotelTransportation in the cityFood+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

US/BRZn helping Brazilian Orphans,$105 ,"$10,000 ",Volunteer," August 17, 2016",4,1,GILBERT,AZ,50000,,1,"                                    JS                                                            Joseph Smith                                                                                                                   GILBERT, AZ                                                        Hello, my name is Joseph Lewis Smith, born Jos Luiz Ferreira Lima in Brazil, S. A. in 1977. Unsure of the situation I was born into, it overall wasn't good. I was abused and neglected as a child. Soon after my birth and being abused, I was taken away from my biological family and placed in an orphanage in Sao Paulo, Brazil. By the age of five and a half, I was adopted. MISSION: My reason for giving back is due to the fact that I was born into an abusive family. I was taken away and put into an orphanage in Sao Paulo, Brazil S.A. I dont know the time frame of this transition or how long I was in the orphanage because much of my memory of this part of my life has been blocked. At the age of 5 and a half I was adopted by an American couple who soon became my new family, my new parents.  I always have been trying to find myself, find who I am, who I was and who Im supposed to be. In 1996, I joined the United States Army, which helped me discover a lot about myself during my 14 years as an Army Soldier. During my journey, Ive realized I needed to give back to fulfill the needs of what Im missing. I have looked into Brazil here and there but now my heart has told me I must go and I will be ready. On September 1, 2017, I will turn 40 years old; I figure thats a good age to take this trip but I want an amazing gift and the only gift I truly want is not one of receiving but one of giving. While doing research on the numbers of orphans in Brazil, I noticed the correlation between children coming from an abusive home and soon to be living on the streets; the numbers are staggering - incredibly, in the millions. I wanted to focus on the orphanage I came from first. Let me put my focus there, let me put my time and energy there. At the same time while this is going on, an inner piece of me wants to find out who I am and where I came from. Im hoping to do so as well. I know this journey will be an emotional and physical one for me. I know the many scars I have will shine through as well as bring back some painful memories. Even doing the research I have felt pain especially for these orphans. Anywhere from 500 million to 1.5 billion children worldwide and about 1.7 million children in Brazil are faced with abuse daily. If I can save one or more by showing them hope, compassion, love and caring by bringing in the right people to talk to them and giving them inspiration to learn from, maybe we can make them grow into becoming a part of society that can turn things around for the better and show the same love I have.  Currently we are working closely and will continue too with the American Society of Sao Paulo, as they are our liaison for the orphanage CASA LIMIAR.CASA LIMIARfounded by Nancy Cameronin 1984 CASA LIMIAR is a home for children facing physical challenges. More about CASA LIMAIR and the American Society go to: http://www.limiar.org/about-us.html#casalimiarand http://amsoc.com.br/PURPOSE:The money will be used to: Buy diapers, diaper cream, baby wipes & baby bottles Buy school supplies, art supplies, educational books, flash cards .. etc. Buy toys, games Buy clothes Combs and brushes Dentisty kits Buy candy Buy tools and any supplies needed for any minor repairs and if any major repairs are needed we will look into the funds, contact local contractors Buy cameras that do video/photo I would also like to have enough money for the last evening to present the children a 3-5 course gourmet meal, something Im sure they have never had.Due to the high import tax we may have to buy most of the supplies and goods in Sao Paulo. Once we get settled in. This campaign starts now, today September 1, 2016. We want to grow it out for a whole year as much as it can. The more money we raise, the more we can do and the more we can bring with us. Hopefully, we can continue the success and growth of this project. Also, with the financial assistance we could possibly look at going to other orphanages in Brazil another time frame and even some back in the US. We are also willing to take in donations of items and or sponsorships of products. WHY THIS MEANS SO MUCH: This campaign means so much because its part of my past and so many other kids have gone through the same or even worse treatment than me. Some children dont have the opportunity to get adopted. So, yes this would mean so much to me but I feel it would mean so much more to the ones we connect with - the ones we can help by showing simply the meaning of caring and giving back. As an orphan that was abused by his biological parents this hits home to me, to see other orphans in the same orphanage just wanting a good life but not even sure what that is and if it will ever come true. MYSELF GIVING BACK:I wanted to figure out a way to give back to those that have donated money or have assisted me and my team. I figured we could do video documentary and try to turn it into a small indie project by taking photos along the way of the people, places and things. I envision making the photos all black and white, which shows a lot of power, grace and beauty as well as a raw feeling. Anyone who gives more than $1500.00 receives an enlarged portrait of something captured that is matted and framed. Im also thinking that if any photos are bought, a portion of those proceeds will be donated to an American Childrens Abuse charity. Im still trying to work on other things. Simple things as I would hope more people are focused on giving because they understand that our children should be whom we teach but as well as whom we learn from.Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man. ~Rabindranath Tagore                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

But what is the most effective way of preaching the Gospel?Every country has different methods of evangelizing. In Ukraine, the best way to evangelize among children and teenagers during the summer is organizing a summer camp.Many children and teenagers live in a family where their parents are either in addiction or are living an unhealthy life style.By organizing camps, we take children from their environment and surround them with love and attention. We show them that there is a better life with Jesus Christ. We tell them that there is hope. We teach them songs, how to talk to the heavenly Father during difficult times and how to Praise Him for all He has done for them!To be able to organize such camps, as well as making sure more children have the opportunity to go, we need finances to cover the expenses such as the cost of living, food, and basic camping needs.No donations too small but on the contrary very helpful, even if it's $10 or $20.The next planned camp is scheduled for July 31st - August 6th.Please help us organize this camp for teenagers.May God bless you abundantly!                    + Read More"

It's one thing to travel alone and do what you can to make a difference, but when I joined this organization I became a part of a movement far more powerful than I could be as an individual. I fell in love with this organization very quickly, and I'm honestly overjoyed that I get to pour all of my passion andenergy into something so tangible alongside people who have the same vision for the world as I do.This summer, I have the opportunity to go on a life-changing volunteer program through AIESEC to Morocco. My primary job will consist of using social media as a means to promote cultural understanding between the U.S. and Middle Eastern/North African countries andto help boost the local economy by encouraging tourism. As a student who is concentrating her studies in this region of the world and a passionate advocate for Muslim human rights, I take this job very seriously. I will dig into the serious societal, economical, and environmental issues surrounding this beautiful nation and bring awareness to them.I have been working hard outside of classes to make this trip happen, and I'm already half of the way there. However, I still need money to cover part of my plane ticket and basic living expenses while I'm abroad. Anything that you are able to give is appreciated and will go a long way.I hope I get this chance to reduce inequalities in other communities, break down the walls of miscommunication within our own country, and unite with world changers to move towards a better world.Thank you for hearing my story.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We, the Beisser family, are grateful that you've taken the time to hear our request.  I've felt fear and confusion as a child in a hospital, and I've felt fear and anguish as a parent of a sick child in an emergency room. I hate those feelings; they break my heart.The worst part of them is that you often feel like they will never end. Sometimes the most powerful medicine a child or a parent can receive is the compassion and warmth of another person who simply understands. A smile and a few minutes of ""room to breathe"" can make a world of difference.  I've been making children smile for many years now as an entertainer, and I've also spent many years visiting the sick and hurting in hospitals. I want to combine my love of children with my calling to BE that compassionate voice of understanding for their parents and caregivers.  I NEED YOUR HELP. I don't have very much money, but I have a loving family who are as devoted to serving others as I am. We want to be able to provide smiles and comfort to the families in our area in several ways; here's how YOU can help:                ANY WAY YOU CAN.  I want to raise $10,000 by asking everyone who reads this to donate WHATEVER is on your heart to give, and then forwarding this page to your friends and asking them to donate. That's it. Here's what YOUR gifts will help provide:1) Purchase of a mobile cart for special events and outdoor activities at hospital and community fairs.2) Purchase of a stock of supplies such as crayons, coloring books, packages of tissues and rolls of stickers... thousands of them!3) Offset of transportation and other associated expenses such as parking fees or public-vendor permits, because at some events, we aren't even allowed to give things away for FREE without proper ($$) licensing.4) Printing of business cards and signage and the maintenance of a simple online contact page where parents and caregivers can request our services.  We're NOT part of some big franchised organization, and we're NOT doing this nationwide or even state-wide. I was born in New Brunswick, my father and several generations of his family are from the New Brunswick area, two of my children were born in New Brunswick, and our home church is a presence in the greater New Brunswick area. To me, there's NO better way I can see to help those who are in need of love, compassion and smiles than to concentrate our efforts in New Brunswick, a city we love.  I've spent YEARS in the hallways of the hospitals and care centers in New Brunswick, and I know the city. I know the great need of MANY people there, and I know that the social-services and healthcare-services processes can be depressing and dehumanizing. I want to bring smiles, joy and the love of God to the hurting.  PLEASE HELP. Ask your family and friends. I don't want grand gestures, I don't want big donations... I just want to chip away at these needs and make this caring effort a reality.  I have (approximately) 60 direct contacts through Facebook, etc. If each of those people had ONLY 60 contacts of their own, and every one gave something, we'd raise close to HALF of our $10,000 goal in no time at all.***  Thank you for reading. Thank you in advance for your generosity. Thank you from the children and parents who will feel a hug, share a smile and perhaps a tear, and KNOW that they are loved and not alone. Thank you.***PLEASE NOTE: We are committed members of our local church and will be submitting our efforts and our financial accountability to pastoral oversight on a regularly recurring basis.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Julie passed away on April 13,2012 at the age of 31. She left behindher husband Chris, Daughters Serena, Angelica, Laila and her son Jacob. When I see the kids, I can see and feel thepain they have for their mother, they have so many questions that we don't havethe answers to. I take them out tothe park or parties and I get overwhelmed trying to keep up with all of them. Chris also tries to take them places, but healso gets overwhelmed trying to keep them all together. After talking to many people about this, wefound that EVERYONE either has a similar story or knows of someone goingthrough a similar situation. So we putour heads together and came up with an organization called Sunshine Thru TheRain. No matter how much it rains, thesun will eventually shine through.Sunshine Thru The Rain is an organization that we are in theprocess of forming to help kids that have lost a parent. The goal is to offerthem counseling, have group meetings and outings such as horseback riding,skating, trips to amusement parks ETC., find their strengths and interest andhelp them build on them. Not just forthe kids but also for the parent.We are not running a day care, so the parent cannot justdrop off their children and go back home alone and think about what they'remissing. When putting people aroundother people that have gone through a similar situation, I have found it to behealing. They can relate with each othermore than anyone that's never gone through something so traumatic.We are asking for funds to turn Sunshine ThruThe Rain into a full non-profit organization, to pay for the 501c3 status ,brochures, flyers, website, registration forms, shirts, and banners, so we canoperate our first fundraiser to get the organization started , we are hoping tohave the fundraiser by April 6, 2013. At the moment we are located in theHouston area and our goal is to eventually be nationwide. I alone know morethan 15 children being raised without one of their parents. This is a service that is greatly needed tohelp our children grow up to be productive, happy individuals. Please help us help them.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We are undertaking three two-month placements in Ghana, Uganda and Zimbabwe.  In Ghana I will be working as part of an agricultural project with a local orphanage to help provide a sustainable food source. All food and produce grown is donated to the orphanage in an effort to help feed these at-riskchildren. I will help with crop and animal farming as well as teaching sustainable farming techniques to bothlocal staff and the children. Rianna will be will be nursing in a rural community program with the aim of helping smaller Ghanaian communities deprived of basic medical access and health care.  In Uganda I will support the construction and renovation project. I will be assisting with the construction ofmedical centres, childcare centres and local schools. I will be working alongside a local foreman to help build, renovate, paint andlandscape. Rianna will be placed within local clinics and medical centers which are incredibly under resourced and under staffed. These clinics and medical centers encompass a wide range of medical fields and offer in and out-patient services, tending to a high volume of patients each day. In Zimbabwe both Rianna and I will be assistinga wildlife conservation projectnear Victoria Falls. The reserve is home to the 'big 5' animals - lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo -and serves as an intensive protection zone for the critically endangered black rhino. While at the park we will be working alongside the game reserve team and anti-poaching unitwith conservation management and research activities. We will be helping with:- Alien vegetation removal- Fence patrols- Waterhole creation- Freshwater eco-system analysis- Reserve clean-up operationsAs some of you may know, this project represents the chance to fulfil a lifelong dream to work as a park ranger.  These volunteer projects all aim to make a lasting improvement in the local community and are focused either on improving quality of life for local people or conservation.All of the projects we have chosen will bephysically demanding and we hope very rewarding as we focus on giving my time, energy and efforts to improve the lives of others.

I shared my passion for this project with my sister, and we came up with an idea to combine our love of travel and our intentions to help make the world a better place by joining up with World Ventures & Hug It Forward to help build a Bottle School in Guatemala. In order for us to make this happen we need to raise the funds needed for this trip by December. It is such a short time away, but we are determined! If we do not reach our goal, we will try for another opportunity in 2014, but would love to have our service make an impact this year for the holidays. Help us put our compassion in action, and improve the lives of children in Guatemala.  ""Jesus  did not spend a great deal of time discoursing about the trinity or original sin  or the incarnation, which have preoccupied later Christians. He went around  doing good and being compassionate.""~~Karen  Armstrong Just imagine what the world would be like if everyone embraced the Golden Rule, and treated others with compassion and dignity.

As many of you may know, I am an 8th quarter student at Life Chiropractic College West near San Francisco. I have 7 more quarters left before I graduate, so officially halfway done! With great determination I've been working over 40+ hours a week at school and many more hours dedicated outside the classroom at weekend seminars to practice my skills.If you haven't heard from me in a while, it's because of this! I know it will all be worth it once I graduate and begin working towards my passion to help people become connected to their health again. It has been such a blessing to find my calling in a career that will allow me to bring health and healing to so many people. Where Am I Going Next?On September 23rd I will board a plane for Haiti, where I will spend 4 days checking and adjusting hundreds of men, women and children, and another 4 days we will travel to the Dominican Republic thereafter visiting schools and hospitals to check and adjust those who need it. We will be serving people who have little to no access to healthcare at all. I have been training for an experience like this for the past two years. I will be accompanied by experienced Chiropractors, 10 other students from my school, as well as nearly 30 other Chiropractic students from different parts of the USA. Dr. Peter Morgans ChiroMissions team goes to the same area every 3 months  so the community has grown accustomed to receiving fairly regular chiropractic care. This trip to Haiti will be Dr. Morgans 76th service trip! In response to the earthquake they started a non-profit and built an orphanage. We will spend a good amount of time at the orphanage, checking and adjusting the orphans and caregivers  and of course playing with the kids! His service trips are well-run, with positive reviews from my colleagues. I'm confident this will allow us to focus our energy where it matters. The name of the organization is Chiromissions and you can find out more about it here:  http://www.chiromissions.comOver the course of full adjusting days, we will be checking and adjusting spines in the following locations: United Nations Military Base  We will check and adjust the staff at night, as we will be staying at the UN base. Orphanage  We will serve the Orphans and their caretakers. Rumour has it we may have the opportunity to stay at the orphanage one night! Market  Busiest market in town.  Clothing Factory  Largest employer in the area.Schools and hospitals in the Dominican RepublicWhy do I need your help? In order to make this trip a reality it is going to require money. My goal of $2,500 will cover all potential expenses...flights, food, ground transportation and boards crossing fees as well aslodging (8 days). Food and proper hydration is especially important given the conditions and volume of people we will serve.Crowd funding is a greatpractice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts from a large number of people.From The Bottom Of My HeartI invite you to join me on this trip of pure service with me, to particpate in any way you feel called. Kind words and prayers are greatly appreciated if that is how you can best support me! Your support inspires me to serve more people and to give of myself at levels I've never reached before.If you feel it is in your being to support this cause I am ready to gratefully receive your gift. I appreciate your financial support more than you know. I am looking forward to the transformation that this service trip will ultimately bring. Thank you immensely for being a part of my journey :)In case you're still reading...here's a little more info about my profession:Why Chiropractic?Chiropractic is the science, art and philosophy of detecting and removing vertebral subluxations. Subluxations are minor dislocations of spinal bones (vertebra) that cause the nerves exiting the spinal cord to become impinged. When this occurs the brain is not able to communicate messages from the brain to the body and vice versa. These messages can be for heart rate, digestion or even breathing..and of course sending and recieving pain signals. The brain also allows us to interact with the world...how we feel, who we love and what motivates us. If there is an interference in the transmission of these messages someone will not be able to function at their highest potential, which can impact physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being. Chiropractic adjustments restore the brain-body connection to facilitate healing and improved communications within the nerve system in the body.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

They beat him, tazzed him, and smothered him until he was brain dead. He was doing nothing wrong. There's a video of it on youtube. You've probably seen it. It made international news. Was on CNN and every major news outlet. It is excrutiating. His parents had to take him off of life support because the doctors said he was already ""gone."" We refer to the area as Kelly's corner. It's a living memorial to him and a place that many homeless people call ""home"" still. The homeless population in Fullerton alone has grown from 100 three years ago to 300+ today. And often when I am at Kelly's corner, I cry thinking about him. I bring flowers and mylar heart balloons, poems, prayers for his family. I bring my soulfulness into this place. It all started for me when the cops were found not guilty of killing Kelly Thomas in early 2014. I had never ever been an advocate before. But that verdict rattled me into getting off of my butt and doing something to make this world more compassionate. Sometimes if we're lucky in life, something will resonate so much in us, that makes us step upand push ourselves to growlike we never have before. We can shine better than we thought possible.I started out in February 2014 using my own money to buy food, water and toiletries for the homeless at the Fullerton Transportation Center in Fullerton, CA. But folks, I am not made of money. I'm dealing with a single income. Now people are helping me with donations which makes me cry every time. It's incredibly touching. I don't belong to a charity or church. I am one person trying to make a difference bringing supplies once a week. I am extremely hands-on. I stay there and listen to the people who live there. I don't judge. Instead, I provide friendship, acute eyes and ears on the streets, and find out the reality of life on the streets which is often times heartbreaking as well as heart warming. I ain't gonna lie, it's very emotional work. In between visits, I am working with city government, city and county agencies, and like-minded people to help what most consider to be invisible people: the homeless/mentally ill. The stigma of homelessness and mental illness needs to be broken. This is one of the last frontiers of civil rightsbecause it's hidden and so darn difficult to deal with. Life is just messy. The sooner we face this and help those less fortunate, the sooner we can breath and live as true human beings, true contributors to a more meaningfulworld. These issues will not go away on their own. It's we the people who willown our humanity. https://www.facebook.com/LeighWhiteArtandPoetry?ref=hl&ref_type=bookmarkI buy all the supplies at the 99 cents store and you would not believe how happy a homeless person is to have a new toothbrush or shampoo or deodorant. They love the new socks I bring, the neosporin, the bandaids, the cereal bars and the list goes on and on. I try to bring at least $50 work of stuff when I go which is every week. I am not associated with any charity. I graduated from Cal State Fullerton and lived in Fullerton, Brea and Yorba Linda for many years. It was my claimed new hometown. I also have mental illness (chronic depression and social anxiety), so I can relate to my comrades who are battling every day to make it. So Kelly's life and death affect me in several personal ways. If you provide me with some financial assistance, I can continue tobuy the supplies and deliver them to Kelly's Corner. I show complete transparency with photos and receipts of all the goods delivered. Let's make the world more compassionate together. Make a difference with me. Please donate. Let's make everyone more homeful. We can do this! #kellythomas                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We're raising money to provide recreational equipment (basketballs, footballs, soccerballs, baseballs, bikes, jump ropes, etc.) for the children's personal use outside of school. Most of the students live below the poverty level and simply don't have the resources they need. We have arranged multiple visits to the school to educate about physical activitiesand help set fitness and lifestyle goals. Through the use of questionaires and speakingwith the students, we'll determine their biggest challenges and what's needed most. We're also in the process of working with local shops for donations and discounts.All donations will go directly towards recreational equipment for the kids. The goal is to have all donations by the end of October. We all knowthat small things can make a big difference.

But the earthquake of 2015 devastated many regions. The hardest hit were the distant and remote villages in the mountains. I visited Nepal in 2013 and fell in love with the people of Nepal, a country being the 2nd poorest country in The World, but containing the happiest people on our planet. As an educator, I found particular interest in the people and organized a group wanting to join me to me in returning to Nepal in 2015to volunteer in schools and hospitals......but a major set of earthquakes rocked the region and even though they needed our support, it wasn't safe for us to return. So, finally, this fall I will be traveling back to Nepal spending 5 weeks volunteering in the mountainous, rural schools and doing whatI can do to rebuild the schools in my spare time. The remote, mountainous villages have suffered from the earthquake and have been the hardest to rebuild their life and their schools.Being a science teacher all of my life, planning creative science lessons adaptable to students in the Midwest and my home town school, I learned early on to challenge oneself to motivate students to become independent thinkers, independent researchers, independent scientists. And I have beenso blessed receiving numerous teaching awards, some very special teaching awards such as the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Teaching and the distinctive award as Iowa Teacher of the Year. Those awards and accolades, which are so numerous to list have reminded me that those awards are simply a plane to step off as I have retired, and to Pay It Forward. I will return to Nepal in late October and November using my abilities to teach those Nepalese children. I plan to use my role in Nepalese classrooms teaching English and, of course, my passion 'hands on' science using science experiments to challenge students to think about science and how science affects their lives.So, I am pleading with you to assist me in rebuilding and replenishing the schools in the remote mountainous regions of Nepal. Please help me help and make a difference in the lives of the children of Nepal. I am doing massive fundraising all summer long. Here in Southeast Iowa, I have planted a VERY large garden and the proceeds from the sales of these veggies are being directed to the Nepalese Education Fund that I have set up. And if my campaign is successful and I surpass my goal of raising $25,000 for refurbishing the classrooms in these remote regions of Nepal, then those additional funds will be used to assist in rebuilding other schools in outlying areas. I have attached photos of the devastation of schools in the regions that I plan to work with. Please assist me in Paying It Forward. Assist me in garnering a future for these wonderful people and the children in Nepal. All donations will be most graciously accepted by the Nepalese for their future is at stake. Thank you for your time in reading this message.and please like and / or share this message with your friends and family.

I am currently a full time employeeat Boston Medical Center as a research assistant/study coordinator,and aspire to work in the medical field in thefuture.What is the problem?International Medical Relief is an international non-profit organization that provides medical relief and care to underserved and vulnerable people around the world. Their goal is to improve the health, wellness, and quality of life of those populations most in need through short term medical mission trips where volunteers, like me, give their time and services for the medical relief of the developing world.According to the World Health Organization, diarrheal diseases, cholera, and pneumonia plague the people of Panama. Alcoholism, poverty, and a lack of potable drinking water all contribute to the public health issues of these communities.What am I doing?During my time with International Medical Relief in Panamathis summer 2016, I will volunteer in the medical clinicand fill in the role with patient intake/health history, triage, educate in community health, and more. Patients will have all types of acute illnesses like many skin infections, upper/lower respiratory tract infections, etc. I look forward to making a difference in the lives of these patients in Panama, and providing them with opportunities for better lives. One of the tasks that I am extremely excited about is conducting community education sessions that will help educatethe Panama people about nutrition, sanitation, clean drinking water, and water storage.LogisticsHere are the dates:o Starting on July 29, 2016o Ending on August 7, 2016Thefunding will be raised for travel expenses/lodging and medical supplies for the on-site clinic. Without your support, International Medical Relief cannot meet the medical needs of the underserved throughout the world. I will be extremely appreciative of all your efforts and hope that my experience working with underserved patients can make as strong of an impact in your lives as well.

Recently a grandmother, with her granddaughter, who she had raised since she was 7 months old, were turned away from shelter by the Dept. of Housing and Community Development because they hadn't been officially eviced from an apartment--they had been put out by a family member. They had to seek overnight shelter in a church. 50% of homeless people are turned away by DHCD because they do not fit neatly into official categories. But all homeless people need help! The Arise staff helps people every day, often out of their own pockets, the need is so great. Please donate to this very worthy organization, run by tireless, dedicated people out of a tiny storefront in a city where many poor and homeless people are struggling. Emergency funds are needed almost every day. Please give what you can.As someone who loves and supports Arise, I will be so grateful to you for your help. You will very possibly be saving a life!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Imagine that hunger! In an effort to survive, they had to do whatever it took, even if it meant that theirchildren couldnt go to school.Growing up in that environment, Evens prayed to God and asked God to usehim inany way He wanted.People hear that Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Perhaps you have never gone down there to volunteer or to see the difficult life of the Haitian people. Many people ask how these people live in conditions where it is a struggle to find water to drink or food to eat. But this is their reality!Many people think the Haitian solution is that someone needs to take care of these people, someone needs to give them food each day, give clothes and money. That is not an ideal solution.Whatthese people need is to first put their trust and hope in God. Secondly, they need a place to work so they can have a job and support their family. Finally, they need an education. The Haitian people are not lazy; they love to work and to take care of their families.  The problem is that 75% of professionals in this country live without a job, then they leave the country.  After the devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010, the condition of poverty grew.Evens & Karina have dedicatedtheir lives to serve the community of La Victoire by founding Sustainable Action International (SAI), a 501(c)(3) organization. SAI's mission is to work alongside the people of Haiti to provide for basic needs, support economic development, and cultivate discipleship to create a sustainable future. Please donate to SAI to help us erradicate hunger, educate children, save lives & bring hope.Thank you for your support.God Bless                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

This season we're training for a couple of 5Ks, and the students are off to a great start! These kids are so inspiring and fun, I have no problem waking up early to attend practice. And if you know me well, you understand that this is no small feat! Saturday mornings with RBO are truly the highlight of my weekend. One would think, being a teacher, that I get enough face time with students throughout the week. Running with Oakland's youth, however, and guiding them as they are awakened to the power of endurance, is nothing short of beautiful. Running For A Better Oakland is a non-profit organization that encourages K-12th grade students to develop healthy lifestyles through running. With the support of run mentors and volunteers, RBO youth set goals, train hard, and build confidence during the program season. RBO empowers students by promoting the idea that accomplishment is the result of dedication and commitment. Students carry the skills gained through this experience into all aspects of life, drawing on them both now and in the future. One factor critical to the organization's success is that the RBO community reflect the greater community of Oakland, and that there are no financial barriers for students to participate. Your donation will support our efforts to meet this goal.Your contribution will help provide students with race entry, coaching, running shoes if needed, and energy drinks/nutrition at practice. RBO would not be successful without the commitment and generosity of volunteers and donors. We can't thank you enough!Thank you so much for whatever your contribution may be. I feel very fortunate to be involved with Running For A Better Oakland, and I'm excited to involve you in this inspiring experience, regardless of a financial donation.For more information on RBO check out our website at  www.rboakland.org, and feel free to ask me any questions!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Id like you to meet George Negoescu. George is a talented gardener who designed and built Ridgewood Garden, a lovely garden in Queens located at the corner of Shaler Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. As many of you know, this area was once a trash filled eyesore. But where we saw trash, George saw plants and flowers. So with the 104th Precincts permission, he generously devoted his time and expertise to turn this neglected corner into the neighborhood gem hes so pleased to share with us everyday. As George was not hired for this project, he did not receive compensation for his service nor is he seeking compensation now. This charming garden rivals any block beautification project, but its a work in progress which George pays for mostly out of pocket. To date, he has spent over $5,000 of his own money, and although his hope is to continue to maintain and improve Ridgewood Garden, he can no longer do it on his own. I started this fund to help defray some of his expenses. Also, George takes an annual extended vacation during which time a paid worker maintains our community garden. Donations will also be used for wages paid. All donations are appreciated and will help keep our neighborhood beautiful. Thank you all for your generosity.Gail Grabowski                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

The facility, located in the heart of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, is a refuge for street children.LRDE serves hundreds of children a day, and every one of these children have a unique story. Many of them work in the streets, collecting trash or selling souvenirs to tourists; they range from 4 years old to teenagers; some cant go to school because they have to work to support their families; many dont know what it means to have a role model, a parent, or any adult figure to serve as their foundation for growing up.I imagine how my childhood was filled with safety and freedom. Despite having my own stresses and struggles growing up, I lived with relative ease and comfort, because I knew that no matter how cruel the world was, no matter what anxiety I encountered, somehow my parents were there to make it all ok, to tell me that the world is good, and that I am good.Then I imagine these kids childhoods, how many of them dont have that basic human comfort that many of us hadthe feeling that someone will shield and comfort them, to grow up with a sense of ease and freedom. From such young ages, theyve had to take up the mantles of adulthood in order to survive.Their stories are many and varied, but they all come to LRDE for the same fundamental needsthe same needsevery child and human being craves: a place where they can experience safety, comfort, and have a place of respite from the toll and responsibility of their lives. Its a place where, despite all, they can act like kids. They dont have to worry whether theyll eat that day. They dont have to worry if theyll have a safe place to go to if theyre in trouble. So for the holiday and new year, Jamie (my volunteer buddy), Kim Zoodlemouse , and Jen Arnold would like to raise funds to give the kids something special. Depending on how much funds we can raise, the fundraiser will go toward buying them holiday gifts, clothes, books, or even a trip to go to the pool (we took the kids to the pool while we were there and they absolutely loved it!). You can see the following letter from LRDE for more information.Transparency in donations and fundraising is very important to me, so well be posting receipts of the donations to Les Restaurant des Enfants, and well work with the staff at LRDE to ensure that the money goes to where its needed. AND well get lots of party pictures from the staff!I also understand that the holidays are tough for many people financially. Even the smallest contribution helps, and if you cant give any money, then helping to get the word out and bringing awareness of LRDE can be just as effective as any monetary donation!And if youre interested in sponsoring a child, feel free to contact meor Jamie Cook , and we can give you additional information on sponsorship. Sponsorship eases financial hardship on a child and their caregivers by paying for their school clothes and supplies, one kilogram of rice a month, daily spending money, English school (English is not part of the national curriculum, but English education allows them much better employment opportunities as an adult), and also helps pay for LRDEs operating costs.Thank you so much for your time and your tender hearts. And even if you can't make any donation, butyou've read this and yourhearts are touched by these children, then I'll know that I've made a difference.Always,Benjamine HeathFrom Jamie:This experience has been like nothing else. Ben and I had no idea what we were getting ourselves into when we decided to go volunteer in Cambodia. I got my assignment a few days before leaving for Phnom Phen. All I was told was that I would be working for a soup kitchen for street children, and the placement made me both nervous and so excited. We had no way to prepare for what we would find there and the deep connections we would make.I am so grateful to LRDE for their commitment to these children and giving Ben and I the chance to become part of such an amazing experience.These children are so special to usthey are sokind and gentle. The first time that Chamnab (my god son) hugged me and told me he loved me I don't think I have ever felt anything so powerful. Having a true connection with a child in need has been one of the most rewarding and life changing experiences I have ever had. I will forever be so grateful to the people who created LRDE, for creating a place that these children and come to grow, learn, be safe and feel loved.I'm so excited to be a part of these children's upbringing and share there awesome stories with everyone!Always,Jamie Cook                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I am helping some attorneys in Ohio who are filing a lawsuit against the media for being an accessory after-the-fact and suppressing exit polls that show that Bernie actually won the election. When the US State Department or the UN is monitoring an election, if there is more than a 2% discrepancy between the exit polls and the supposed vote total they know there is a problem, and won't certify the results. Here in the United States, especially with the Diebold voting machines, there is sometimes a 5%, 10% or even 12% discrepancy. Instead of declaring that there is a problem, they just adjust the exit polls to match the fraudulent vote. This is the standard in the United States of America. Because of this the adjusted exit polls are not posted by the media, as they have their own ""horse in the race"", who they want to win. Of course right now it is obviously Clinton. This is racketeering. We are suing them. We will win. I am looking for other delegates to help me expose this at the convention.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

We have less people visiting who are volunteering with us. Money that we saved long time is gone away after we dont have working many months, is really difficult for me to looking for helping in the orphanage school. Everyday I was trying with my hardest all time but is not successfully. Very soon we will not have money to control with bad situation. I am worried about in the future soon will be close down! Is very much bad for children when we close orphanage and school, because there is nowhere for them to go. Cannot close by seeing them return back home without future. If I dont tell everyone what is happening in the orphanages and school right now, people dont know what happenings in the orphanage. The children are happy looking and we are strong but we do not have enough money, everything is cost a lot money about 2800$ a month to control everything 100% in the orphanage and school! Just like November & December 2014, I dont have any savings to pay bills for the children living and staff in the orphanage and school because of low tourism. I was trying as the people volunteering sharing a little bit, but we dont have as many people help us as before! We have worked hard for 10 years help change the children life.But we are getting less help each year and we dont know how can we live, and control in the orphanage during these hard times. This is happening right now in the orphanage school. I know people around the world have had hard time with economies to support own family also. That is why I was decide set up the Facebook page to fundraised to asking to help us even smaller amount. Please do not hesitations helping us. Youre so much important for us continue for living with the children: Education, House renting, Food supplier, Rice supplier, Health care, Cooking expenses, School fee, Bed supplier, Utilities, Electricity, Transportation for public school, Gasoline, and Water are very much need for us running cost every day.I will use donations to spend right away on the orphanage, school, and children need.

I will personally see to it that ALL of your donations go DIRECTLY to those in need in the most meaningful and impactful ways.This is not a fundraising effort to finance my airfare to the region or housing for the summer as those things have already been paid for from my own personal accounts. Every dollar accumulated is going to be put into the hands of people that need it most.Homes destroyed without warning in attacks linked to funding from Assad's regime -Reuters, May 2013The greatest humanitarian crisis since WWII is just one of the headlines that has been used to describe the mass exodus of people from Syria as their own regime has been accused of using chemical weapons against its citizens. While the USA has committed actions contributing the rise of terror cells that have destabilized the region, warring factions have for years now devoted themselves to the struggle for power which has ripped the nation apart. About 11 million people, or half of Syria's population, has either been displaced or killed in the the bloody legacy of these atrocities. Think about that for a second and let that number sink in. Half of the country.Kurds fleeing violence and waiting to get into Turkey    -National Geographic, April 8, 2016I had the opportunity to speak with the Syrian Ambassador to the USA (2003-2011) and current ambassador to China (2012-present), and he made one thing abundantly clear: there is no end in sight for the violence tearing his country apart. People will continue fleeing and there is not even the beginning of a plan to resolve any tensions fueling the current unrest. In his words, ""The fight will continue until the last person in Syria."" With a political lack of focus on the side of humanity, I am pledging my physical action to help my fellow man in need. I will be spending the summer volunteering with Humanitarian Support Agency in Kara Tepe Refugee Camp on the Island of Lesvos in Greece  http://humanitarian-support-agency.org/This island is the main processing center where people cross into Europe from Turkey after braving a perilous sea crossing on small boats that often fail to meet their purpose. From here, theycontinue on in their long and red-tape restricted journey to resettlement. Refuse piles up as unpredictable numbers of people reach the shores of Lesvos, Greece after fleeing violence in Syria via Turkey -The Australian Times, November 3, 2015I will be doing a variety of things depending on the need and the flow of the day. Anything from distributing food, clothing, and other provisionstogiving people a gentle smile and bottomless servings of love. As most are coming with just the clothes on their back after paying varying amounts of money to escape violence, they are in need of many supplies to satisfy their basic needs while they endure the bitter frustration of unknown waiting periods as well as necessary items of the long journey ahead. Regardless of political beliefs about this, the bottom line is that people are suffering. Together we can make a direct difference to alleviate some of that suffering. Many weeks ago, volunteers facing a dwindling stockpile of clothing and increasing needs started a weekly tradition of traveling to Turkey to buy clothes ourselves. Your generous donations so far have funded a mountain of needed items which have brought joy and dignity to some of the thousands of residents we have clothed. Below you can see exactly how your money has been put to work to this point. August 11 will mark our biggest trip yet as we try to bring back bags overflowing with children's clothing we are completely out of and quality footwear thatcan withstand the hot, rocky surfacethat eats through soles in Kara Tepe.+ Read More"

Lothlorien TRC:  Save Our Center!,"$35,885 ","$115,000 ",Volunteer," March 24, 2015",202,18,EAST AURORA,NY,1100,,15,"                            Lothlorien Trc                                                                                                                   EAST AURORA, NY                                Lothlorien Therapeutic Riding Center, Inc., a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization, needs your help! We are on Twitter @LothlorienTRC and Facebook at Lothlorien Therapeutic Riding Center, Inc..Hundreds of riders, from war veterans to children with special needs, are all booked to ride at Lothlorien in East Aurora for the season. Theres just one big problem. All the snow that fell in East Aurora this past winter has taken a toll on the riding centers indoor barn and riding arena. Right now, the indoor arena has been deemed beyond reasonable repair by structural engineers and lessons have been postponed until the weather improves and the outdoor arena can be used for the bulk of lessons.The severe winter weather and recent snow melt has caused severe damage to our facilities, both to the indoor riding arena as well as the barn structure, which houses our horses. The buildings have been inspected by structural engineers and the indoor arena has been deemed beyond reasonable repair. The stall area will require extensive reconstruction. At this time, we have had to suspend classes until the weather improves and we can use the outdoor arena for the bulk of our lessons. Given our weather, relying on the outdoor arena will limit participation. This is a significant setback as classes were to begin in March and we are already fully booked on weekends until November.The Lothlorien Board has been actively strategizing and our plan is as follows: 1) build a new, larger arena, 2) repair our stabling area and 3) tear down the small arena and convert this space to an outdoor ring. There are significant advantages to a new arena - our current indoor arena is small and we are at capacity because of these space limitations. A new larger arena would allow us to serve more and continue to grow.The new arena is estimated to cost approximately $125-150,000. We have yet to determine the final cost to repair the stabling area but an assumed cost of $100,000 is reasonable. We will also have to assume the revenue that will be lost during the time of closure, approximately $25,000. Therefore, the total cost of rebuilding and operationally maintaining Lothlorien will be approximately $275,000. Our insurance coverage is$100,000, a mark we will reach and surpass. Thankfully, we have received generous grants from the Oishei Foundation, Ingram Micro and The Children's Guild Foundation, leaving Lothlorien with a $115,000 deficit.Using therapeutically based equine activities, Lothlorien staff, volunteers, and horses assist individuals with physical, cognitive, mental and emotional needs to achieve their highest potential. Lothlorien also serves many individuals without defined need, but who simply benefit from the Lothlorien experience. This group includes our veterans and children living in the inner city. The impact of Lothlorien is far reaching and difficult to capture in words. For riders with physical challenges, riding provides an unparalleled sense of movement that is not achievable off the horse. Our horses have reached emotionally challenged children in ways that are indefinable. A rider may begin to express themselves in previously unimaginable ways as their comfort level on a horse evolves. We hear regular stories of improved interaction in home and school after riding. Most importantly, riding at Lothlorien is a preferred activity for many and loved and treasured by all.Lothlorien has enjoyed remarkable growth and success over the past three years. A few highlights include multiple renovations, many new partners and collaborations and successful fund raising events. Our growth has been spectacular and we have served over 1,200 individuals over the last two years! Some groups that we accommodate on a yearly basis include: Camp Blue Skies (Hospice), Buffalo Boys and Girls Clubs, Buffalo City Mission children, BOCES programs, St. Marys School for the Deaf, Aspire, People Inc., Seneca Babcock Church, WNY Childrens Psychiatric Center, veterans groups, and numerous group homes for individuals with disabilities to name a few. These programs typically attend weekly lessons in 4 or 6 week modules. Our annual budget is approximately $185,000 with some growth built in. Our budget is tight and we rely heavily on donations from organizations and individuals in our local community.Today we ask for your help to ""Raise the Roof to Save Our Center!"" Lothlorien provides a unique and valuable experience for so many. Please consider helping us in securing this wonderful community asset and ensuring that Lothlorien continues to grow and flourish. Your gift is 100% tax deductible. We will gladly provide you with a donation receipt for tax purposes.

I am now a full-time political activist. I was an activist when I attended the University of Texas (UT); we marched and demanded that UT divested from South Africa during the apartheid regime. After getting my bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering, I worked for many oil service and NASA companies before starting my own software development company. During that time, my politics was mostly anonymous through blogs and other actions.After sending my daughter to college, I decided that the next stage in my life was to make a difference, pay it forward. This country is great. However, its greatness is in jeopardy because our current politics created policies that are shrinking the middle-class, hurting the poor, as a select few continue to extract from the many. As opposed to just talking about what is wrong, my goal is to empower us all to act, to do work that will really fix the problem.I wrote the book As I See it: Class Warfare The Only Resort To Right Wing Doom  a few years ago. I detailed many of the economic issues as I saw them and suggested solutions from a lay persons point of view, something we can all do in a real democracy. I decided to go all in and dedicate my going forward to positive political activism that really effects change. I host the show Politics Done Right on KPFT 90.1 FM on Thursdays at 3:00 PM Central. I speak on all the issues Bernie Sanders talks about from free tuition (pay it forward tuition) to income inequality, to social justice, etc. I interviewed Bernie Sanders surrogate Ohio State Senator Nina Turner, as well as many other Bernie Sanders activist including former Labor Secretary Robert Reich. I live streamed many of the Sanders rallies. As a featured writer/contributor to DailyKOS and OpEdNews as well as my own blog , I wrote extensively to get the Sanders message out to counter a derelict media that either ignored or distorted his message or his history.My Senate district (SD4) elected me as one of the Bernie Sanders National Delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Thank you so kindly SD4. The price tag of the trip is prohibitive for a full-time activist. Activism pays little -- website ads and writing help, but its not software development.Some of us volunteer for the front line. We ask for others to invest in those that are fighting the change that will help us all.I humbly ask you to help fund this trip to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. And how will I thank you?Every donors name will be mentioned in my next book. Any amount is fine. Every donor over $25 will receive a free hardcopy of the book. All others will receive an e-copy. I do not have a title yet, but it covers restructuring of our economy to reflect the real worth of peoples contribution to it as opposed to our current rigged economy.I will provide live streaming when capable. I will be blogging the event and willkeep you all abreast of what is going on. And I will be monitoring my Facebook Politics Done Right message feed to interact with you.Any funds I receive in excess, if any, will be used to continue the movement including other DNC delegates, my trip to Netroots Nation 2016 (I got press credentials), and other social and economic justice conferences.

I'll also be spending 2 weeks in Zimbabwe with the IAPF (International Anti Poaching Fund) to get a broader view of this struggle.

Minimum donations will be asked for if items are requested.Other expenses associated with the tripwill be coming from my own funds. The anti poaching units are in desperate need of volunteers, funding and equipment.

I am also trustee of a homeless charity in St Albans. In 2015, watching the events in Europe unfold, i decided to go out to Greece to help out with the bigger Crisis which was unfolding over there. This proved to be an eye-opener for many reasons.With the genorisity of friends and colleagues, i took outsleeping bags, blankets, warm clothes, medical items and money it was all very much needed. The money came in really useful to feed people hot meals, a basic need that we all take for granted but is actually a rare commodity out there in Europes biggest humanitarian crisis. In fact, the crisis over there is pretty much about that first step in Maslows hierarchy of needs: (food, water, shelter and clothing/warmth). I also purchased rucksacksfor people who were carrying all their possessions in bin bags.Since my Christmas trip, I have been watching avidly events unfold in Greece and across Europe. I thought the situation over Christmas was pretty dire to say the least. I couldn't believe that it could get any worse. Well, it has. Much much worse, more than you can imagine... In the last 10days alone, Athens has seen more than 18000 people arriving at the Port of Piraeus. For a few months now, Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans were making their way from Athens to the Greek/Macedonian Border and onward to other countries. However in February, this suddenly changed. Europe made a decision, with no warning and no explanation to stop Afghans crossing the border, as they have now classed Afghanistan as a safe country. This has therefore left more than 12000 refugees displaced. Many of the refugees who have boarded buses to the borders are either being dropped part-way to the border with no shelter or being transported back to Athens. All the camps and shelters in Athens are now full to capacity. The Port of Piraeus passenger terminals are full of refugees stuck with nowhere to go. I have seen eye witness accounts (including videos) of people being mistreated. Families with children and babies are being locked up in detention centres with very little by way of basic provisions. There are many many accounts of human rights violations across Europe.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/greece-refugees-gather-in-athens-hope-despair An eye witness account (from a Spanish volunteer) of the inhumane treatment of refugees, I have paraphrased:'To get to Athens from the Greek islands on the ferry, refugees are asked to pay 45. This is the same fare as 'normal' passengers. But...thats where any equality ends... refugees are segregated from the rest of the passengers, are made to sit on the floor even though there are plenty of empty seats on the other side, they are whipped (yes whipped) and verbally abused by the Greek police.. through all of this, they still continue to remain humble, accept this is their current destiny and smile......'Suffice to say, Greece and, in particular, Athens is not coping. This last weekend, I went back out again. I sawfamilies with very small babies and children out in the Square or on the streets. The port was full to the brim. Many people were sick. Food has become scarce again. Help is mostly provided by groups of amazing but independent volunteers. But many of them are tired and struggling under the pressure of what they have been dealing with for months. The situation was horrendous. Each night boats were coming in with more refugees. Athens is bursting at the seams. There is a lack of everything. Food and water remains the most scarce item.I am and will continue to fund all my tripsmyself, flights etc, and i will also fund food/water for the refugees as much as i can. I have posted my Christmas and last weekend blogto this campaign so that people can read about my experience.

Bialystock Cemetery PhaseII,$650 ,"$18,000 ",Volunteer," September 2, 2016",5,22,GROTON,MA,26000,,1,"                            Josh Degen                                                                                                                   GROTON, MA                                My name is Josh Degen. I have over 35 years experience working with various stone masonry applications and heavy equipment in my hardscape and landscape business. I and 6 colleagues recently returned from an August 2016 trip to Bialystok, Poland. Our purpose was to uncover, reset, and restore headstones and monuments in Bagnowka cemetery, the only remaining Jewish cemetery in Bialystok.  In 1941, after the Nazis invaded Poland, they killed approx. 2,000 Bialystok's Jews in the Great Synagogue fire on June 27th. Most of my wife's family perished in that blaze. More Jews in Bialystok were killed during the 1943 ghetto uprising. Another 200,000 were killed in the gas chambers of Treblinka. In 1943, in one final attempt to wipe out any trace of the Jewish community in Bialystok, the Nazis entered Bagnowka with heavy equipment and over a period of weeks systematically desecrated thousands of headstones and monuments. Many of the monuments were dismantled and their parts scattered about. The desecrated graves are mute testimony to the atrocities inflicted on the people of Poland during the war years and in particular the effort to wipe out any visible reminders of the Jewish souls interred at the cemetery. We first discovered Bagnowka Cemetery during our visit to Amy's family ancestral homeland during the summer of 2015. During this visit the concept of using my skill based to help restore the cemetery came to be. This past August, we spent six 10 hour working days to uncover and reset over 300 headstones in Bagnowka, which originally contained the graves of approximately 30,000-35,000 souls. Our mission was to restore the dignity and sanctity of this resting place and provide some measure of peace to the dead interred in Bagnowka. The headstones and monuments are extremely heavy, and some weighed in at over 4,000 lbs. With the help of a rented excavator and local contacts, our team worked a very hard week to reassemble and upright just over 300 monuments and headstones during Phase One of this ongoing restoration project.  Our work could not have been successful were it not for important preparatory work by others. Back in 2009, a team of local Polish folks working with others from all over Europe began restoring this cemetery. The initial restoration idea and thrust of this project was that of one of the few current Bialystok Jews, Lucy Lisowska. Lucy engaged a renowned academic in the US by the name of Heidi Szpek. Heidi is a PhD. professor emeritus from Central Washington State University. Heidi translated the Hebrew/Polish/Russian inscriptions and oversaw the proper placement of the correct stone or monument onto the corresponding grave. Our predecessors efforts were noble, but having only hand equipment and a tripod pulley system, they were able to lift only 2 or 3 of these headstones per day. With the use of rented heavy equipment made possible by the generosity of our Phase One donors, our team was able to lift about 50 stones and/or monuments per day on average. If you are pleased by the work we did this summer, we have some great news. We are now planning a Phase Two of this project to occur during the summer of 2017. We would like to reset or upright another 400-500 headstones next year. We will use the funds donated to this effort to pay for travel, food, and housing for our team of unpaid volunteers, for heavy equipment rental, and to pay for the services of a paid equipment operator (not me- I work for free). Using two excavators will enable us to reset many more headstones. In addition to resetting the fallen but unbroken headstones, we hope to work with our European volunteers who will repair broken stones so they can be reset in the future. Please help us to fund the important work of healing and restoring the dignity of these souls. Help right the wrongs and atrocities of the past. If you have any questions or if you need more information, please contact me at josh@joshdegen.com . We are all honored and pleased at the prospect of continuing our work at Bagnowka, and with your help, we will get there in 2017!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Transit Mix, a local company operating as a subsidiary of Chicago-based Continental Materials Corp. (CUO), is in the application process to open this new quarry on leased property belonging to Hitch Rack Ranch, on Highway 115, approximately 6 miles South of Colorado Springs, CO.Heres a partial list of what another quarry will bring to our area:o The addition of 400 to 600 truck trips per day, adding to the truck traffic from three other quarrieso Traffic safety issues, particularly ingress to and egress from Highway 115 by the truckso Increased noise from mining (blasting), rock crushing equipment, and truck traffico Dust from miningo Dispersal of wildlifeo Impacts to scarce water resourceso Decreased property valuesThis effort is to acquire funding from our community, neighbors and friends in the surrounding area, and anyone interested in preserving a unique lifestyle and rural hillside environment. All contributions will be applied to various costs of communicating to our community and all state, county, and other legal entities involved in the approval process, potential legal costs to contest a variety of issues, and investigative and research activities requiring fees or other costs.Goal: Our estimate is $50,000 for the goal of this effort. Any and all donations are gratefully accepted, but please note we are a citizens committee, not a charitable organization.Transit Mix has been doing their permitting research activities for 2-1/2 years, and we (the community) were notified by a public posting in mid-February of this year (2016).

In partnership with the National Institute for Social Care & Vocational Training, also known as Beit Atfal Assumoud, LEAP recruits volunteers to teach English, as well as lead recreational activities while living and working in the refugee camps. SHINE offers students a productive and safe space during their summer vacation to strengthen their English language proficiency, while simultaneously exploring various recreational skills. In addition, students go on weekly field trips that nurture and foster students' mental, physical, and social growth at a pivotal stage in their lives. Some of these activities include yoga, photography, videography, theater, social media, among many others! In turn, our volunteers learn about the Palestinian refugee reality in general, but particularly in Lebanon and get a glimpse of Palestinian heritage and culture. Volunteers and students share a mutual learning and sharing experience. Upon return to their home communities, volunteers are encouraged to raise awareness about the plight of Palestinian refugees.LEAP has been operating its summer project SHINE since 2010. We have impacted over 3000 youth over the past 5 years, over 160 volunteers, and 50 teachers. Help us bring the same summer experience to over 600 Palestinian refugee-youth in the camps of Lebanon this summer. Adolescents face a number of social pressures and adult-like responsibilities. SHINE allows them to be children, while also re-inspiring their thirst for knowledge. English is an essential skill because in Lebanon, students must take a national exam for promotion to high school, which is administered in English. LEAP's SHINE project aims to remedy these impediments and advance youth through our intensive and fun summer project, which promises to make youthfeel more confident, happy, and accomplished.90% of youth expressed that their English proficiency improved and they felt more confident in English, while 98% indicated that they intend to participate in SHINE again.Help us bring in our 6th year and make SHINE 2015 a reality by generously contributing today!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

The earthquake in Nepal last year desvastated the country. People lost theirlives, homes, families, and the community was permanently altered (many sacred temples are now lost forever). The fuel blockade from India was and is in full affect, challenging any relief or rebuilding efforts. There are still thousands of people (A YEAR LATER) still living in makeshift tents. They need our help, and I want to help them. I have decided to volunteer for the Fuller Center to spend 2 weeks in October rebuilding houses for the survivors. The typical house costs around $4,000 to build. 100% of the houses built by the Fuller Center prior to the earthquake have survived. The houses will be hand-built, in the community side-by-side with the families using reinforced rebar and concrete. I want to be able to help them rebuild, and I need help to do so! Even though this is a volunteer trip, expenses are needed to supply the worksites. Every donation is greatly appreciated, and to know that by donating you are directly helping families in need. Any extra money raised above my goal will be donated to the Fuller Center and applied directly to this trip to help those in need. Please help me get to Nepal so I can give them the much needed help they so desperately are in need of! http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2016/04/world/nepal-one-year-later/+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

My project is to donate a life size WWII Veterans memorial statue and placing it in my local park/memorial garden. I have the all the City of Frisco approvals, the Parks and Rec. Department has designed the landscaping and the Garden Club is donating all the plants for the landscaping plan. I am also working with a General Contractor and Engineer for the construction of the base. The artist of the statue is donating her time and is very interested in my project. My hope is to reach a goal of $20,000 before September 1st and I am almost there. Now yes, this is a very large amount for an Eagle project. This is something that I wanted to do for our WWII Veterans that we are losing everyday. Soon we will no longer have these Veteran. This is also an Eagle project I could come back to and show my kids later in life. The initial deposit on the statue for the artist to start is $12,000. The statue is called the ""FlyBoy"" which I have attached a picture with this project.Please help me with my project and if you have any questions feel free to email me.I will be extremely grateful and honored from the help that I receive from you, whatever amount $5, $10, $15 $20, $100 or $1,000 I would appreciate.Thank you for supporting my project!+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Water use for human needs and small-scale farming is specifically prioritized above industrial use. Despite this progressive constitutional prioritization, water rightshave been violated in the Dulcepamba watershed in Bolivar, Ecuador. An accurate multi-year data assessment of water availibility and crop water demand is necessary in order to help 72 small-scale farming communities regain their rights to water. Current Status: We are three years into the study now, and it is going well! Our #1 goal over the next 10 months is to hand the project over entirely to the local farmers, and ensure its ongoing sustainability when the American project managers leave. In order to do this, we need funds for three things: 1. Amodest salary ($25 per day) to employ one more local team member, so that he may be trained to take on aspects of the project, including helping farmers officially apply for their water rights, and employ more efficient irrigation methods. 2. Local farmers to maintain daily measurement and water level records at 8 stream gage sites throughout the watershed, ($1 per site per day)3. An Aquasonic Sensor that measures water levels and stores data.

My name is Tsebiyah Mishael, and I am an actor, singer and writer from New York!Throughout life, I have thrived on being able to be creative. I've been acting, singing, and writing for just as long as I remember, and I'm super grateful for the opportunities I've had to cultivate those skillsets- and the teachers and mentors who have encouraged me to do so along the way.Not only am I what you might call anartistic soul, I'm also a travel junky! This insatiable wanderlust was first ignited in me when I went abroad during my junior year at Sarah Lawrence College, to study theatre intensively at the British American Drama Academy, in London, England. That was my first time being off of the continent and across the pond,and it absolutely blew my mind. Not only the experience of traveling for the first time, but the experience of traveling productively- for the sole purpose of working on my craft while immersed in an entirely new environment.Now, after being out of college for almost two years, my wanderlust is getting seriously out of hand! I began searching for opporunities to travel productively, perhaps on a service trip, or maybea gigdoing a show in another place. But what I stumbled upon surpassed my wildest expectations: it was ACTion: Tanzania.ACTion: Tanzania is an ""artist expedition"" program headed up by an organization called Dramatic Adventure Theatre, which sends artists out into the world so that they may gain experience in their travels that enrich their artistry, and/or give back to the communities in the places that they are visiting.With ACTion: Tanzania, I'll be spending a month in June 2016 doing the following:1) Traveling across Tanzaniawith a company of actors, a director & a road manager/translator; seeing animals on Safari, hiking with monkeys, as well as visiting the cities of Zanzibar and Dar Es Salaam.2) I'll be able to visit Bagamoyo, (roughly translating to ""lay your heart down"") which was one of Africa's largest ports in the atlantic slave trade. As an artist and a woman of color, this part of the trip is very near to my heart. I've always dreamt of being able to lay my heart down at place where many of my ancestors saw their home land for the last time.3) Learning how to teach theatre to children, many of whom arelivingwith HIV or disabilities. I'll be trained in developing and implenting lesson plans that will guide the children in writing and performing their own pieces of theatre. As I experienced first hand, theater (or art, in general) is very theraputic for humans, especially children, and the lessons they learn about themselves and their capabilities leave impressions on them forever. Just as the amazingteachers I've been so fortunate to have left impressions on me.4) Devising ourown play as a group;building apiece from the ground up usingour experiences while traveling, or own personal experiences, and all of the unique and beautiful things that make each of us unique and beautiful. The play then gets put up in NYC, two weeks after our return, for everyone to see! I hope you'll join us to view the celebration of our efforts and the telling of our story.The total cost of this expedition is $7,950, and it includes every moment of the trip, from my takeoff and landinginNew York, to our travels throughout Tanzania, masterclasses, food and other daily expenses.But I need your help! Whether your donation is $5 or $500, I am so, so, grateful for the contribution. Every single itty bitty bit counts! Of course, as contributors to this trip of lifetime, this journey is just as much yours as it is mine. I want you to be a part of as much of it as possible! So I will undoubtedly keep you updated with photos, poems, and blog posts via social media (twitter, facebook, Instagram, tumblr) throughout my whole trip to Tanzania and the process of putting up our original play upon our return to New York (and the exciting moments leading up to all of that, of course)!Thank you for your support! Please SHARE this fundraiser on all your favorite social media platforms so we can get the word out and expand our fundraising family. I'll be back again with updates as our efforts progress. Thank you again for the time you've dedicated to checking this out- it is so very muchappreciated.Love, Tsebiyah Ps.

The project is run by volunteers and is heavily reliant on the goodwill and compassion for those who are in need. There are many people who go without themselves to care for those who may be their only family or friend, their pet. We want to help these people by helping them to provide necessary items for their very loved pets.Any funds collected will be going towards Desexing, Vaccinating mircochipping and basic needs like food, fleaing medication and de wormers.Peggy's StoryPeggy is a 3 legged, aged, Red Cattle girl rescued from Wyong pound by the amazing Wally's Doggie Rescue. She came to us very lost and confused; both food and animal aggressive and seemed to have severe trauma both physical and mental. When she arrived we had no doubt we would find her owner, as she had clearly been someone's much loved pet. Had she been lost with no microchip? Had her owner passed away? Had she been surrendered because her owner could no longer keep her due to financial constraints? Sadly we never found out but we KNOW she was loved before and she is loved again.We want to prevent this from happening to other fur friends by making sure that animals are identifiable and families are supported when things get tough. These people love their pets just as you do yours, lets help prevent them from being another statistic in our pounds.Please like and share Peggy's Promise: That no fur kid will go without the basics https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152749414648938&set=gm.350001855174464&type=1+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Meredith Kerr and her son Hugo, of Reservoir in Melbournes northern suburbs. Meredith was nominated by long-term friend, Justine Sless. Well be aiming to renovate as much of Meredith and Hugos three bedroom unit as the crowdfunding campaign will enable, with a priority on modernising and improving the kitchen. We would warmly welcome donations from tradespeople, business owners and other generous locals of time, materials, fittings, appliances and furniture. Please get in touch withJen Clark directlyif youd like to contribute to the project in some way.  Were aiming to commence the renovation in May / June, 2016.For more info about Jen Clark Spaces visit: www.jenclarkspaces.com.auPlease note: JCS are volunteering / donating their time, services and expertise IN FULLfor this project and will not be recompensed financially in any way, shape or form. A balance sheet of how all funds raised were allocated to various materials, trades etc will be available to anyone to view at any stage.From Jen Clark:  Meredith is a highly deserving winner. We can see how much love and effort she has put into finding a home for herself and her son, after many tough years. Meredith is the sort of person who will always make the best of her circumstances, but that doesnt mean she doesnt deserve a helping hand - and in this case we can we see the potential to turn a very dated unit into a highly practicaland welcoming home for two beautiful people. Despite her own struggles, Meredith is very generous. We know it goes against her instincts to ask others for help  so were doing it for her!From Meredith Kerr:  Hi, Im Meredith Kerr. Im blown away to have won the Room Reno Remedy Competition created by Jen Clark Spaces. What a great initiative! I dont want to be all woe is me, but this is my story. I am a single parent to my ten-year-old son, Hugo. Tragically, Hugos dad died in a motorbike accident just a couple of weeks before he was born, so its been the two of us for years and it hasnt always been easy. I am a breast cancer survivor and have been through the physical and emotional rigours of chemo and operations. When Hugo was a toddler, I took night classes in business and accounting.Now I have a good part-time job in the not-for-profit sector.Heres the deal: Ive just bought a little unit for me and Hugo to live in. Its a shitbox, but its our shitbox. Were thrilled to finally get out of the rental cycle, but its in need of a big makeover andwithout help, that won't be happening anytime this century.1979 may have been a great year for music, but it wasnt so great for interior design. The bathroom and kitchen havent been updated at all and are functional at best. Mission brown features prominently. Truth be told, its a bit depressing.Dont get me wrong, Ive got lots of good mates who lend heaps of support in all sorts of way, but its pushing the friendship a bit to ask if they can pop over to gut the bathroom or install a new kitchen sink. And my family all live interstate.I know that there are a lot of people who are a lot worse off than me, but this renovation will really make an enormous difference to our lives and spirits. I am so humbled by this opportunity and thank you in advance for kicking in to makeover ourhome.From Justine Sless (Meredith's friend, who nominated her): Meredith is one of those women who Id classify as a top chick': funny, says itlike it is and bloody hard-working. Shes always been a single parent  when herpartner died in a motorcycle accident two weeks before Hugos birth, it cut short Meredith's promising career as an opera singer.I have seen Meredith work through cancer, chemotherapy, a mastectomy, then a breast reconstruction, all with a steely nerve and an unwavering lack of self-pity.As well as working in the not-for-profit sector, Meredith volunteers as a board member for an indigenous arts organisation. Amazingly, she has saved up enough cash to buy her first home  a testament to her hard work and judicious financial management. Buying her own home is a really significant step for Meredith  as it is for all first-home owners  but I'd say more so for Meredith,because it gives her Hugo a much-needed sense of security.I'd love nothing more than to see their place embody the same warmth, care and love that characterise them as a family.+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"
Thousands of Bernie Delegates Unite,"$1,591 ","$2,500 ",Volunteer," June 26, 2016",33,3,JACKSONVILLE,FL,642000,,15,"                            Matt Killen                                                                                                                   JACKSONVILLE, FL                                                        Thousands of Bernie Sanders supporters from all over the country are uniting to send their delegates to the DNC Convention in Philadelphia.The trip will cost most attendees $2500dollars minimum for the one week event (hotel costs alone). Delegates are to stay in the vicinity of the ironic Wells Fargo Center, which is very expensive.Hotels in the area have raised their prices by 400% most Sanders Delegates are young and just starting their lives making this all the more difficult.As of today I have raised $250 for this epic trip to save the country and still need $1250 to cover the costs I did not save for. When we ran to become delegates they told us we would be responsible for travel and hotel expenses however I think $2500+ is a lot to pay for our right to vote. So until we can get these laws changed and have publically funded elections, we really need the Bernie supporters to step up and help out. We are in the final stretch and on the verge of making history. Let's finish strong! A little about Matthew:Matthew Killen came from Weatherford Texas, better known as the quarter horse and peaches Capital of Texas. Although the small town had all the charm of a Bible Belt village, the town also had all the hallmarks of big city problems. Weatherford was an excellent teacher to Matthew and a great place for people making the best future they can with what they have and the people they love. Those formidable years would shape him forever as he watched his Mom fight her way out of homelessness, literally. Anna Jerez was a karate teacher with a dream and the personal fortitude to look at herself in the mirror and tell herself shes worth more, that she is unique and that she could help others. Her instructor Pat Burleson reached out and let her stay in a horse letting her do whatever she liked to it to make herself comfortable. One night she had a dream that her family and her students gathered all of their resources and built a giant karate dojo for them all to use. The next day she got to work putting her - vision to organizing - and invited all of her students out to help her build her dream. She told them if they helped, she would teach them karate for free, for the rest of their life and the rest, is history. Anna now lives on two acres, she owns with her husband, and now has several schools around the Dallas Fort Worth area with her now husband, Pat Burleson and Matthews brothers Luke and Chad Killen. During that time a lot of the home responsibilities were placed on Matthews shoulders as well as his other two brothers. His father, Richard Killen, worked grueling hours in various aeronautical establishments but still made time to cook dinner every night, tell jokes and rant on politicians that came on TV. The brothers would have to commit to schoolwork and chores without supervision, which didn't always happen. These days Richards hard work has paid off and he is now a lead inspector at Lockheed Martin. On September 11th 2001 Matthew was taking his GED to formally drop out of high school. He wanted to join the military however they changed their requirements from a GED to a HSD and he was also arrested several times for not paying ticket fines. In a town that small you dont get away with anything, especially being a Puerto Rican in Texas. Matthew has a history with the police in his small town, they knew him by name. One day his Dad was driving Matthews car alone when he was pulled over for a spot check. Richard was surprised to be pulled over and even more surprised were the police to find Richard and not Matthew in the car. Richard knew that Matthew was telling the truth all along about being harassed by the police. When Richard came home he told Matthew what happened and apoligised. Matthews only option to go to Job Corps and spend 3-6 months there to show the Navy he was serious about joining the military, so he took it. When he finished, it was the first time he wore a cap and gown, but it wouldnt be the last as Matthew likes to say, success is addictive. In the US Navy BM3 (SW) Killen saw the vast cultures of humanity. He was constantly having his good ol Texas paradigm challenged. Matthew immersed in the cultures of Europe and South America which built his own personal perspective on the world. As he walked the streets of Colombia on his last deployment, he never knew it would be his last. (Earlier in 2008 he fell down a ladder well which caused a back injury and severe insomnia but he got by.) The next night in the Cartagena Bay, the number four diesel generator seized causing a massive fire. A combination of the already provoking insomnia mixed with rotating watch cycles and days with no sleep was taking its toll. Matthew was on watch while they were waiting for orders and hallucinated he told his medical officer and was honorably medically discharged in April of that year. After getting out of the Navy Matthew felt some regret, regret that he didnt do more to help change the Navy for the better. He complained about his back pain several times to no avail and just kept pushing his limits. On top of that they took away their day sleeper cards because one person lost one, there was no time to sleep. Matthew says the math wasnt there for anyone to get decent sleep. There were three - five hour - watch sections so every fifteen hours you were on watch on top of your work day. He thought maybe if he would have went up the ladder, he could have made a change but it was too late, he was already out. Matthew knew that some people didnt take him seriously because of his crooked teeth so he put himself through braces at Jacksonville University, he fell in love with the campus and hoped to one day attend but he knew with a GED that it was a long shot. After getting out of the Navy Matthew went to Florida State College at Jacksonville, a large junior college with campuses around Jacksonville, he met some good people, learned a lot and started to find his place in the civilian world. He graduated and his parents couldnt be more proud as he was the first person in his entire family to go to college. He applied to several schools and was beside himself when Jacksonville University sent the letter of acceptance. While at Jacksonville University Matthew studied Public Relations and Film, worked on the Organizing for America Campaign for President Obama, was the campaign manager for Ramon Day for City Council, started three companies, and even went on tour with the band Slightly Stoopid as a videographer. Matthew set up charters and clubs for The Young Dems,The Tiger Bay Club and The University Law review writing constitutions for each one himself. Matthew was on the Deans List and graduated Jacksonville University, Zeta Phi Eta, balling his eyes out like a hungry baby with his entire family together by his side.In July of 2015, Matthew and a few of Jacksonvilles most talented game changers started the Jacksonville for Bernie Sanders Campaign, to fight for progressive ideas in their city. Through which they have gained thousands of progressive volunteers information and are working with now to elect a new government. Matthew is often heard in the news talking about turning Duval to Bluval! Matthew is currently working as a public relations consultant for new media at his company Killen Media LLC and the Communications Director for the Jacksonville Young Democrats. Matthew is running to be a PLEO Delegate for Bernie Sanders in May 2016. Will you help send him?                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I live and work in Telluride, CO and I attended my first caucus this past March, because I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidateto be the next President of the United States. I know this community is full of people who agree, and I'd like to ask all of you to help your neighbors""feeling the bern""with an important part of Bernie'scampaign to win the election:the Colorado state convention in Loveland, CO on April 15-16.Our precinct and county caucuses were incredibly well attended and exciting--the people came out to participate in their democracy and show their support for their candidate of choice. A stark majority of us caucused forBernie Sanders, and because of our sharedvalues and vision, we won all of our local contests. Now, we're at the next step for his campaign in Colorado. At the Democratic State Convention, local delegates from all over the statewill gather to officially determine how many of the Colorado'sdelegates will be awarded to each candidate.Bernie Sanders' supportersareplanning to win there, too, carrying our shared values and vision to the highest levels of our democracy!At the county assembly & convention (after the caucuses), San Miguel county Bernie supporters elected our local delegates to the state convention. Passionate people from this community stepped up and were voted to make the trip and participate, as citizens and as representatives for their neighbors. They will be attending the convention to represent Bernie'svotes at the county level, argue for hiscandidacy, and spread the ideas behind our political revolution. This fundraiser is to support them by helping to pay for gas and food while on the road to and from Loveland.Our San Miguel County Bernie Sanders Delegates and Alternates are:Crystal Glynn, Hallie Simpson, Leslie & Trevor Browning, Laurie Markovitz, River ""Rio"" Coyotl, Ian MacCracken, and Shauna Palmer. We are hoping to raise enoughmoneyby April 14th to send themon their way with snacks and drinks, and withfunds to reimburse each driver for the gas used on the 400 mile drive(one way) to Loveland and back--an estimated $100 worth of gas for the roundtrip. The total cost of the trip is estimated to be about $700. Any contribution of any size is both helpful and greatly appreciated.It's possible that one or moreof San Miguel county's Delegates will be elected at the state convention to continue on to the National Democratic Convention in July ofthis year. Should that happen, anyunused funds from this fundraiser will be used to support them. If not, any unused funds will be donated in full to the Bernie Sanders national campaign. Should this fundraiser result in excess funds, they too will go to the national campaign at BernieSanders.com.Local Bernie Sanders supporters, volunteers, and participants in the caucuses should feel so proud that our county is fired up about this election season. Participation is vital toan electorate that gets results from our government on the issues we care about and the policies that we want implemented. Democracy is challenging, fun, and exciting, andif you don't use it, you lose it! So let's work together and get Bernie Sanders into the White House, to ensure that participation is encouraged and we the people (not the billionaires)get to define our nation. Bernie Supporters, thank you so much for your political action, your strong views, your gracious reading of this message, and your support for our community's delegates!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

Have you ever felt embarrassed? You know what I mean Maybe you tripped on a small object in front of a crowd, told a corny joke that no one laughed at, or did something that made you a public example. Whatever it was, you felt embarrassed, and nothing can really describe that butterfly feeling of embarrassment. This is what many children face every single day...This is not a stunt, or some type of gimmick Im doing this because I encountered tons of kids who wear the same thing every single day because their families live in poverty. Therefore, I vowed to myself that not only will I walk in the shoes of these kids and raise awareness, but I would do something that benefit the schools that have students who struggle with this issue.Our organization is dreamingof creating closets for students who often times lacked closets in their own homes (right in theri school). Why? So they can have access to clean clothes! We wish to empower schools with the necessary resources for those students.How can you get involved? Simple. You can drop off at our headuarters [LBW 3270 East Main Street, College Park, GA, 30337], or you can give monetarily  100% of your giving goes directly to uniforms.

I am currently working on my Eagle Scout project benefiting Duck Creek Pop Warner. Pop Warner is a non-profit organization that provides opportunities to play and experience youth football in our community. I know the importance of the Pop Warner football program, because I have played football through the program for five years. As a means to benefit my community, and to help me achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, the Boy Scouts highest honor, I have decided to build a storage shed measuring 24x 28, with a 24x12 overhang. The purpose of the shed is to store football gear for the Duck Creek Pop Warner youth sports programs. Currently Pop Warner is paying to store their equipment in an off-site storage facility, and this money could be better utilized to purchase and update their safety equipment. I am writing to you today because I am in need of your help, in the form of tax deductible materials and/or donations. I estimate the cost of the building will be $20,000. My goal is to have the project built and ready for use for the fall 2016 football season. This is a very ambitious project that will benefit the youth of our community for years to come. All donations are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. Location of the shed:Shed Blueprints:+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"
Bond for Release of Asylum Seeker,"$4,100 ","$5,000 ",Volunteer," May 9, 2016",43,4,SALINAS,CA,81000,,2,"                            Patricia Adura-Miranda                                                                                                                   SALINAS, CA                                                        My name is Patricia Adura-Miranda and I am pro bono legal counsel for a Honduran mother seeking asylum protection here in the United States. This GoFundMe campaign is not for funds to pay for legal services, as these services are being provided for free. This campaign is to raise money for bond release, so this traumatized mother does not need to live in the debilitating conditions of detention pending her asylum trial. Unfortunately, it is often the most eligible for asylum that cannot withstand the mental strain of detention due to the type of trauma and torture that they experienced in their home country.By way of general background: There are hundreds of thousands women and children that have recently fled incredible, undisputed violence and torture in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Many organizations are banding together to help address this humanitarian crisis with free legal services. I was part of the CARA Pro Bono Project that was and is on the ground in Dilley, Texas giving free legal services to detained individuals that have legitimate legal claims to protection here under our laws. Our various immigration lawyer associations then make efforts to take some of these strong cases through to completion in immigration court. This case is one of those, and is being provided completely free of legal costs to the client. If you can imagine, the women and children fleeing for their lives from Central America are going to be some of the least likely to have money for attorneys or to post bond.Immediate case and need: I cannot speak about her case facts other to say she has suffered immensely and that she has a strong claim for asylum protection under our laws. I will call her Emma for client confidentiality purposes; Emma is not her real name.Emma is currently detained in a detention facility in California. Being detained is a great mental strain on her, exasperated by the type of persecution and trauma she endured in her past. Being detained also means that she is severely handicapped in her ability to help collect/coordinate for the corroborating evidence from her home country, and to otherwise prepare for her asylum trial. Emmas bond amount (the amount she has to pay to be set free during the preparation for her asylum trial) has been set at $10,000. Through much effort and generosity, her family and friends have been able to gather approximately $5,000 of this $10,000 bond. I am attempting this GoFundMe campaign in hopes of securing the remaining $5,000 needed for Emmas release from detention. Emmas next court hearing is in mid-May. Bond release prior to that date will be advantageous for her legal case, but for Emmas emotional and mental health, hours matter. Any money raised in this campaign will be applied to her bond release or in the manner explained below. None of the money raised will be applied to Emmas legal fees with my office, as our legal assistance is being provided pro bono (which means free.) If, for whatever reason, there is excess money from this campaign prior to the refund of bond, or the full bond amount cannot be obtained to post bond, then the money will be given to Emma to help secure the mental health evaluations and/or other third-party costs that will strengthen her asylum case presentation, or will be applied to her basic subsistence, at her election. When the bond amount is refunded by ICE (as it is after a Respondent attends all her hearings,) the refunded money will be provided to Emma to help her start life again.Again, it is my sad observation that it is often those with the most genuine asylum claims that cannot survive in detention long enough to present their claims. If you are able to help Emma, she, I and her family would be greatly appreciative. Your gift may very well change the outcome of this case, and bring back a victim that has been for so long forgotten and unprotected. If you cannot help financially, you are helping nonetheless if you use this peep to learn more about the Central American humanitarian crisis that is occurring in our backyard and in our borders. Thank you for your time and assistance.Best wishes,Patricia Adura-MirandaMiranda, Magden & Miranda, LLPUpdate: Bond was not able to be paid due to uncontrollable events with the other portion of the bond that had been promised by family friends of Emma. However, we were able to secure an earlier trial date for Emma and the funds raised are being applied, per the description above, ""to help secure the mental health evaluations and/or other third-party costs that will strengthen her asylum case presentation."" Our efforts are now on preparing for trial. The trial will be strong, strengthened considerablybythe evidence that your support through this campaign is allowing us to collect from Honduras and here. The overwhelminggratitudethatEmma felt from complete strangers reaching out to help her has given herstrengthto not give up before her case is presented. I am confident that Emma will successfully secure the asylum protection she deserves. Thank you all for your support, it has and will make a life-changing difference.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I've chosen Synergy Services as the beneficiary of my Eagle Project.  Few organizations do as much as Synergy does for our Kansas City community every day. As their website says:""Synergy provides a full continuum of care to assist individuals and families with immediate respite from violence, and services which empower clients to find and choose good options for future safety and success. In addition to our work to treat the effects of violence, we provide supportive services to families in crisis in an effort to prevent violence. Additionally, we focus on community education and social change in an effort to build a safer and more humane society."" You can read more about Synergy Services here:  http://www.synergyservices.org/One of the needs Synergy had was for some simple picnic tables that they could place outside both the Synergy House and their Youth Resiliency Center. This would let them have a place for people to sit, eat, talk, or work outside. My plan is to lead a team of Scouts, friends and family in the construction of 6 picnic tables. We will fully construct, finish, stain, seal and place them on the grounds for Synergy.  I expect the cost of materials (and maybe a couple pizzas) will be around $750.  I'm trying to complete the project by February 27th, so the clock is running! Please consider supporting this cause.

What an amazing chance to minister to others and share the word of our lord! This has been something that I have prayed about and felt such a strong pull on my heart that I just have to go!

While on this trip we will be working on a mobile clinic to bring medical care to a community that needs it. In addition to this, we will also be participating in a project to help the community which will be determined based on what they tell us they need. A common project this organization helps with is building stairs to allow safe access to drinking water or a safer way for the people to get around their community. Another great aspect of this organization is that we will be partnering with local doctors, which means the patients we see on our week-long trip will also have follow-up appointments so they can continue to receive medical care after we leave. I will use donations to cover the $775 fee of participating in the mobile clinic, as well as to help cover the cost of flights to and from Lima. I am so excited to have this incredible opporunity to serve a community and to get to know a little bit about their culture while I'm there.

As most have heard, in just about a month, on October 15th, I will be leaving on a fall break service immersion program to the Dominican Republic. A major part of Creighton is the ILAC (Institute for Latin American Concern) Center, where this program is hosted through. Being able to attend a program in the Dominican through ILAChas been something I have wanted to participate on for my past four years at Creighton. I am so grateful that I have the opportunity to take part in it my senior year.ILACvalues the importance of global vision and creating well-rounded individuals. It is based in Catholic, Ignatian values, and encourages participants to engage in solidarity and a stronger faith.While this is the first time ever that ILAC is hosting a service opportunity to the Dominican Republic, here is a videoput together by one of my sorority sister's who just recently studied in the DR for an entire semester. Hopefully this willgive all those reaingmore a visual idea of what I may encounter during my time and the experiences .This experience means a lot to me as it is a continuation of my Creighton experience, but important to my post-graduation experience as well. During my Creighton experience, I have had the opportunity to work as a Girl Scout volunteer with Burmese Refugee elementary school girls. In the Dominican, I will be able to continue my education on refugee populations as we engage in dialogue with the Jesuit Refugee Services in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Furthermore, after graduation, I have decided to take a gap year to become a member of a service program, such as Americorps, before applying to medical school. While I do not know my final destination, this immersion program will ensure additional experience working with underserved populations, the opportunity to live in solidarity with them in the campos of Rodel del Pino to hear their stories and engage in their community.""Solidarity is the social meaning of humility. Just as humility leads individuals to all other virtues, humility as solidarity is the foundation of a just society.""Finally, service has always been a huge part of my experience at Creighton. From participating in weekly service, service & justice trips, to being a leader of these experiences...I have had my fair share of community service within the United States. However, this wasn't enough for me. I wanted the cultural aspect. I wanted to learn how other countries are affected by the same issues we experience here in the United States, such as poverty, immigration,and refugees. In addition to all that has already been mentioned, during this trip, our main service project will be at a local community church in Rodeo del Pino, near the Haiti border. Here, we will be working alongside the community to paint their church. We will also be learning about Haiti's binational market, having mass with the community, and most importantly, living with members of the community in the campos.The funds raised here willassure that I do not let this opportunity pass. I will be paying for the trip entirely by myself, soany amount is truly, 100% appreciated. I am not one typically to ask for money, however, I am also in the process for saving up for medical school applications, so I have dual costs to focus and prioritize at this time. As stated before, I am very thankful for any donation. I am blessed to have been chosen for this experience, and I cannot wait to share all the lessons I have learned during this immersion experience with everyone. The money raised through this page will pay for travel both to and inside the Dominican Republic, housing, meals, and our service project materials. If it is not the appropriate time to donate in your life, I understand, prayers are also appreciated as it will be my first time traveling out of the country.+ Read More"

I will be sending the funds raised tohelp her in paying for the cost of rebuilding her home. On Saturday February 20, 2016 a category 5 cyclone, the strongest in history hit the islands of Fiji and neighboring islands as well. The beautiful islands of Fiji and its people were devastated by the effects of cyclone Winston. My family is hoping that we are able to raise enough funds to help my aunt, whose only source of income is sugarcane farming and that has been destroyed by the cyclone. Any amount you can donate is greatly appreciated. And I will be personally responsible for delivering the funds to my aunt. If I am unable to travel to Fiji, I will transfer the funds to her via bank transfer. Thank you for all your generosity and God bless! . .                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me raise funds to make this trip possible. We will be working with the local missionaries, Henry and Ivonne Smith, to spread the news of Jesus. 90% of familes in Guayaquil, Ecuador do not have a father figure in the household. We're going to help the needs of the single moms and the fatherless in the slums of Ecuador. The recent earthquake in Ecuador has added to their desperation and our goal is share the hope found in Jesus, and to provide relief for their extreme poverty.The beauty of this trip is that we will spread the love of God not only by our words, but also by our actions. We believe that our actions: feeding and taking care of orphans & developing relationships and loving on people, is the best way to show the love of Jesus. We hope to meet both the tangible and spiritual needs of the Ecuadorian people through various outreaches, community projects, and specific care for the single moms and their children.Tragedyhas struck Ecuador very recently, to be specific a earthquake of a 7.8 magnitude shook the country on April 16, 2016. At least 661 people were killed and more than 27,732 others were injured in the earthquake. We are goiing to speak hope and life into the country and show them they are not alone.Please prayerfully consider helping me raise money to spread the love of Jesus and meet the desperate needs of the people. If you cannot donate any money, I would still ask you to pray over our missions trip for lives to be changed. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest! Love you all =).
