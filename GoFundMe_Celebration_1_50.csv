Tse Chen Ling Center is the only FPMT center within San Francisco. We will be celebrating our 26thanniversary this June. We have moved many times over the years - starting out in our founder's living room and then various buildings along the way, always renting. We have finally found a building that fits our needs perfectly,with a landlord who would like to sell to us, but we need the down payment to buy it! We have raised half the money needed already but need the other half. Won't you please consider a donation to our fund so that we can really celebrate our 26th anniversary in a permanent home! The merit you'll obtain from donating to this great cause is immeasurable and our gratitude will be as well!Thank you!

                        This is what we should be supporting if you have monies to support something. Teaching and creating gardens so people can have natural organic healthy food to eat. Great job Yongo Otieno Wycliffe . This fund is to bring Yongo from Kenya Africa to the USA to teach and learn from us here at Angelite Center. This picture is an example of his work as he just made 3 portables using sacks ,soil and organic components. On a small piece of land this system of gardening will help the community gain some knowledge in producing varieties of crops and balance diet on just a small piece of land so they are not living on and eating corn every season. We are so excited to have him visit so we can teach him even more ways to garden and teach others to bring healthy foods to many. He already has his passport the money needed is for just for his visa and round trip ticket. I will take care and support him while he is here and if there is any extra money it will go to Youngo for spending money. Thank You! We reached our goal for his ticket but it turns out that getting the VISA is nearly impossable from Kenya to USA. I am asking for help now so we can hire an attorney to help Yongo get this VISA so he can come for his diplomatic journey.

                        Recently the Waterloo, IA city council (in a 3-3 vote) deniedMayor Quentin Hart's request for travel funds ($1440) to attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis. He has said the conference is too important to miss and will spend his own money to attend.He has a travel budget. It is for travel. What better use than for our Mayor to attend a national conference for mayors. Hartnoted:I cant think of a time, even in a budget crisis, when a mayor was denied the chance to go to a conference when the money is there.One of the no-voting council members said ""Weve never had a mayor go to this conference before.""Well, this city elected this Mayor. This Mayor is trying to do his job.Those who fund this effort are saying:(1) Let ourMayor do thejob we elected him to do.(2) Let ourMayor engage with other mayors across the country at a professional conference so that he may bring knowledge and expertise back to our city to benefit Waterloo.(3) We support ourMayor's efforts to improve Waterloo. (4) He won this election, and if our city council as a whole will not support him the citizens of Waterloo will.Even a $1 donation will show the Mayor and the city council that we will not let 3 men block the efforts of a duly elected mayor and the interests of nearly 70,000 city of Waterloo residents.Anyfundsdonated will be givento the Mayor for the express use to cover histravel expenses to this conference. The campaign will be closed when the target goal is reached. [Edit 6/23/16--Funding will now be for the 2017 US Mayors Conference in Washington DC. The donation will be given to his campaign organization Hart for Mayor for disbursement].*Disclaimer* I am a Waterloo resident. I am not related to, or affiliated with the Mayor. I have never met him. I am just a concerned citizen.Link to recent Courier article: http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-council-turns-down-mayor-s-travel-request/article_2c3f7f9d-61fc-55ba-9a80-8bad41ea4477.html

We all know the feeling. Youre sitting there on your lunch break at work, hunched over your phone brainlessly scrolling through your news feed. You're chasing just a little bit of excitement, a slice of escape, 'a nip slip of happiness' if you will. Yet all youre coming across are Candy Crush invites, Frank Bod selfies and photos of Charlie eating out six times a day. Its a painful cycle broken only by strange car dorks youve never met blogging on about every problem in their miserable lives. Youre 15 minutes deep into smoko, your phone is getting warm and your battery is plummeting. Youre wasting your hard-earned data on unfulfilling social nothingness. Shit is wearing thin.Suddenly theres a break in this storm of mediocracy. A mirage has appeared on the digital horizon presenting itself in the form of 300 shares and a blizzard of hashtags - A fresh Scott Mitchell edit has dropped!Watch in HD the caption says, Turn it up! Scott cries out across the internet. Of course youre not going to do either of those things, but what you are going to do is hit play, forget the real world enjoy the hell out of yourself for the next 4 minutes. 

Scotts videos have been providing us all with reasons to keep Facebook for going on 5 years now and hes never asked a dollar of any of us. What were trying to do here today is in a small way, say cheers cunt' for that. Right now Scott wants nothing more than to travel to Oregon (USA) in June and shoot an event called Bash to the Future 3 with a bunch of his internet homies. He needs about $2500 to get there, and because he chose to video YOU drifting/fishing/getting hitched/throwing up, instead of becoming a baller Lawyer (true story), he needs a little bit of help to get there.So dig deep (kind of), and spring 5, 20 or even 50 bones towards the cause. Youll get to see a cool video as a result, but more importantly youll make a big hairy dude really happy.

                                                We want you all to meet our daughter Avigial. She is 15 and her laughter will always light up a room. This year she will be going back to Camp Hasc for her 10th summer. Camp HASC is the award winning summer program of the Hebrew Academy for Special Children. Located in the scenic Catskill Mountains of upstate New York, Camp HASC provides over 300 individuals with intellectual and physical disabilities the opportunity to enjoy a seven week sleep-away camp experience, just like many of their siblings and friends. Camp HASC is unique in its synthesis of academic and recreational programming. At HASC we seek to maximize the development of each individual's potential by providing special education, speech, physical, occupational and music therapies as well as computer instruction, adaptive physical education and adaptive aquatics. Hand in hand with their academic program, the campers are able to participate in the full range of recreational activities including (but not limited to) sports, swimming, field trips, night activities, Torah learning, roller skating, carnivals, concerts and mainstream social programs with other camps.As result, these special youngsters and adults often gain skills and achieve milestones beyond the scope of parental expectations while enjoying enjoyable activities in a stress free, social environment.I don't think it's possible to describe what camp does for our daughter but let me try. Two years ago she ended up in the hospital with severe mono and continuous seizures. She stopped walking talking and eating. She was in the hospital for 3 weeks and then in rehab for a week. She was discharged a week before camp started. My husband and I looked at each other and said, ""what do we do about camp?"". At this point she was weak, walking with a walker and very down. We knew that if she was going to get back to herself and we can hear her laugh again, Camp Hasc was the place to do it. Afterall, miracles are seen there every summer.We quickly packed her up and I drove her up accompanied by a friend to camp. When we came down the road to camp and reached the gates, it was the first time in months that a huge smile came across her face and with glee she called out for her home away from home Camp HASC.Some people say that Disney World and Disney Land are the happiest place on earth but they have it all wrong. Once they visit camp they will see that Camp Hasc is the happiest place on earth. When you walk through camp you are surrounded by the sound of laughter and the smiles that are on everyone's face. We turn to you to help us get Avigial back to her summer home where her smile never leaves her face.Thank You from the bottom of our hearts.Charlotte & Robert

I want our clients to get their children off the floor, or for pregnant moms to get off an old couch, or a veteran off an air bed, and onto a real mattress. We purchase new boxspring/mattress sets at a huge discount, but only when we have the funds to do so. This birthday, I want you to put your money where the NEED is...In honor of my 30th birthday I'd love for you to donate $30 to PHA's Good Night Sleep program. I want you to share this with everyone you know so everyone can celebrate my birthday by giving to those who truly need it. GoFundMe deducts 5% from each donation made, plus a 3% transaction fee. I'd love to see every pennyraised go directly to someone in need, so please consider adding $2.50 per every $30 donated to cover those costs. My goal: $3,000 by October 19th. 100 people making $30 donations. That's 40 boxspring/mattress sets. That's a lot of sweet dreams. That's amazing.The best birthday gift will be your generosity! Thanks for being my friend and supporter <3** All funds will go directly to me and a final check will be cut and donated to PHA during the week of 10/24.

HOLYOKE, MA                                





                        My name is Kenny Roche, this gofundme is for a very new and exciting idea coming this October 28th-29th. I've decided to create an entire Haunted House experience using the actual Holyoke High grounds. All three floors along with some outside rooms. The schoolcafeteria will be used as a festive area providing free snacks and mini games for families to enjoy. The money you donate to us will be used to buy props and horror equipment which can enhance this experience a ton. (For ex.animatronics, special lighting, decorations, etc.) We will need the funds before October 24th, 2016. This means the world to me because I never thoughtsomething like this couldcome to life especially in my school, and it will truly bring our community together and create a sense of unity which doesn't happen too often around here. Any amount donated will be EXTREMELY appreciated. I couldn't thank you all enough. Hopefully together we can make this happen!

ROCHESTER, NY                                





                        Hello, My Name is Adie Akuffo-Afful. I am a recent Marketing Grad from Rochester Institute of Technology, home of the Tigers. Back to back Winners of the AHC Hockey Tournament and undisputed architectural users of brick as construction material (15,194,656 bricks on campus) Wohoo! Go TIGERS! So I have lived in Rochester, New York (The Flower City) for just over 7 years and I just have to say it has been an amazing time. Rochester has so many concerts, art revitalization projects, festivals, breweries, restaurants, open markets and galleries that make every day here another adventure. With a slew of talented and entrepreneurial residents making the city come alive once again. Rochester is a diverse city with many characters and subgroups that make it unique. Even if we have stressful days such as thee endless amount of road work projects that hinder our commutes on a yearly basis, at our core we really do love it here. So as you can tell I really do love Rochester and all it has to offer. But, I've always wanted to do more for the city that has done so much for me. But how, was probably the biggest question that was on my mind for these few months. Then finally it came to me, how to give back to such a great community and still have it centered around what we Rochesterians love about our city. The arts, the unique subgroups and our never ending ability to keep pushing on. So I decided on one event to encompass everthing Rochester has to offer, and that event is the ""Flower Beard Music Festival"". Rochester is also known for having the largest flower centered festival called the Lilac Festival which has nearly 500,000 people in attendance, and has the world record for the largest human flower set back in 2014. So having an event centered around flowers only seems natural when it comes down to it. With the money provided with this campaign we will be able to cover overhead costs associated with this event such as renting the farmland, music/stage equipment rental fee, audio engineers, security, campsite construction, art instillations, paramedics, musical talent, power sources, permits and the list goes on. If we meet our target we will have our official website launch and Facebook event page as well. With this we would be able to bring in ticket sales. 10% of the event goers ticket cost will be going to one of 10 Local Charities that the event goer can choose from. With an option for the goer to donate more either monetary or volunteer time. So a little more about the festival and what attractions may be found on site. Since Rochester has so many talented artist we wish to have art instillation throughout the festival grounds. From wooden interactive installations to balloon centered installations. Also many acts as some seen at the Fringe Fest. There will be many healthy options for food and a slew of Food Trucks from upstate NY that will be onsite at these events. There will be two main sites, the campgrounds and the Festival grounds. On the campgrounds there will be a division of sections in the living quarters and such communal area's as the Fernwood which will be another food court. Porta-Potty will be onsite and cleaned periodically. There will be many attraction in the campgrounds themselves such as Ferris wheel, carnivalesque games and more to come. In the festival grounds there will be game tents, food/beer stands, 3 main stages and 5 smaller stages. There will be a lot of local artist who will be performing and many that will be traveling up to Rochester to perform at these events. We will acquire well known artist as well as our big headliners and more will be revealed as we approach the event in May. We are looking to have a total of 30+ artist on this 2day event and will be looking for volunteers who would like to donate time to help with us as we get closer to the event day. This varies upon how much funding are able to recieve.So we have set Milestones:1) $30k Milenstone:We are able to have one main stage and a smaller side stage for the event. With Local food trucks and beverage/ gaming tent, and water station with a few local food and craft vendors. Plus one to two main art installations on the grounds. Many Local artist, but only 1 to two well known headliners; with a total of 10-20 artist.2) $60k Milestone:We are able to have Two main stage's and two smaller side stage for the event. With both Local food trucks/ food vendors and a Beer tent with local brewers, gaming tent, hookah lounge, water station with a farmers market and craft vendors. Plus three- to fiveart installations on the grounds. Many Local artist, but only twowell known headliners; with a total of 15-25 artist.3) 100k Milestone:We are able to have Three main stage's and three smaller side stage for the event. With both Local food trucks/ food vendors and a Beer tent with local brewers, gaming tent, hookah lounge, carnival/ art gallery tent, Ferris Wheel, water station with a farmers market and craft vendors. Plus three- to five art installations on the grounds. Many Local artist, but only three to fourwell known headliners; with a total of 16-30 artist.4) 150k+ Milestone:We are able to have Three main stage's and three smaller side stage for the event. With both Local food trucks/ food vendors and a Beer tent with local brewers, gaming tent, hookah lounge, carnival/ art gallery tent, Ferris Wheel, hammock forest, silent disco tent, water station with a farmers market and craft vendors. Plus three- to five art installations on the grounds. Many Local artist, but only 6+well known headliners; with a total of 30+ artist.Hopefully with your help we are able to achieve just such an event that will give back to the community whilst allowing Upstate New York to showcase our talented artist, chefs, brewers and all around personable selves in the way we know how to. Funds for this event will not be needed till July2017.

While there are many perks of attending a fairly small school, making real-world connections becomes a little harder, and careers in performing arts rely on connections.The United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT) holds an annual conference and stage expo(in it's 55th year), bringing together enthusiasts of all areas of entertainment and performing arts, of all levels of experience. The conference is the focal point for USITT's activities, providing countless networking opportunities. The 2015 will be held in March in Cincinnati, Ohio, making it the closest conference to NH since 2009 (which was also in Cincinnati). Attending the conference will not only provide the opportunity to make lifelong contacts and meet future employers , but it will be fun to explore a city I've never visited!The funds raised will cover the conference fee, airfare, and hotel stay.

                        Hi all, I am asking for some help to get me to Oklahoma so I be reunited with my Hero Joel . The US Army will be holding a family day and graduation in August . It is going to cost around $2000 for the 4 day trip to see him graduate and see how he lived over the 10 weeks there.this has been the most emotional journey since the day he signed the dotted line in April . It would be a dream come true to be there to watch my Hero graduate and transform into a wonderful man I know he will be!! As you may already know I'm currently not working due to illness so any donations are very much appreciated!! Thank you all for your love and support during this emotional roller coaster!

                        After the success of last year's Gofundme, here we are again begging for money. Okay not really, we are just asking for everyone who is going to be attending to pitch in a few dollars.The point of our Halloween party is as always to get together with friends, family, and usually a few strangers to have a good time. So if you can not pitch in any money do not worry, we want you to come on down and drink, hang out, and have a good time.We do this just to help defer the costs of the party. Last year, due to the donations, we were able to upgrade our lighting as evidenced by the strobes, laser, and lighting effects. And upgrade our decorations including the new witch's haunt area and zombie driveway.Our goal this year is to upgrade to a sound system worthy of a Valkyrie's blessing and continue to upgrade our decorations.The large batches of mixed drinks seemed to work well last year, so we are also looking to get a few more of the giant drink dispensers.Just like last year in exchange for your money and immortal soul*, we will provide food, drink, more drinks, beer pong, party, and fun.The other thing to remember is this party is meant for safe for, so before you give us all your monies, make sure you save enough for an Uber or bring a DD. We want you making it home safe and sound more then we need new decorations!

Jessica is turning 30! Her birthday is on October 15th. It has been a crazy ride from this:to this:I mean it's pretty much the same except we just have to make a lot more smoothies than we did in the first picture.I am going to bless my sweetheart with an amazing trip back to her hometown in Battlecreek, Michigan to see her family there. We haven't gone there in about 4 years. Wow...that's crazy for me to think about. It's going to be an amazing trip no matter what, but I thought I would make a go fund me campaign for her so the kids and I can REALLY bless her socks off. If you would like to give her a present for her 30th birthday bonanza through here, we will use the money to give her a crazy awesome experience, and I promise we will tell you the whole story when we get back. ;)This trip is going to mean so much to Jessica and to our family as a whole. I am SOOO excited about this whole thing. If you want to be a part of it, that would bless us so much. Thank you for being such wonderful friends and family, and thank you so much in advance for the birthday wishes for Jessica!God bless you and your family!

Hey everyone! My name is Joshua and I'm trying to create a Haunted House for Halloween this year in the Wedgefield Neighborhood. Halloween has always been my favorite time of year. Whether it's trying to figure out a fun costume to wear or getting scared at a haunted house, there is so much fun to be had. These last few years I've been a scare actor at a fun haunted house hosted by some good friends of mine. It's geared more for younger kids and has all the right elements: props, sound effects, and of course, candy. This year I want to do more. I'd love to see Wedgefield become a hub of fun haunted houses and trick-or-treaters. To help get us there, I want to make a haunted house. Something a little scarier then what I normally do. The biggest hurdle in the way is money.

My goal is to raise $500 to really make a good house. This money will be used for a number of things:HardwareSheeting (to create walls and barriers)PropsCostumesCandy!$500 seems like a lot of money, but if 250 people gave just $2 we could pull it off. Any money that exceeds the goal (if any) will be used to further decorate and make the house more fun and scary. So please, help me add another great Halloween attraction to the Wedgefield community this year And don't forget to come visit the house when it's done!

We have gone through a lot together and have come out even stronger. We both work extremely hard but still are in need of help with getting together a down-payment in order to finally get our own place. Anything and everything would be greatly appreciated. No amount is too small. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, we can't wait to start on this journey together and thank you for helping make our dream come true!!

                        (SURPRISE - don't mention this to Selmy, please)Hi everyone!As you may know my family's story, I decided to come to the US in 2012. In 2014 my mom decided to come as well, with the hope to bring my dad and brother too. Ever since, we've been trying to bring them here legally, but unfortunately that hasn't happened yet. This year is my parents' 30th anniversary and my mom wants to go be with my dad for that occasion, but doesn't have the money to do so; airfares to Brazil are just too expensive. So, I wanted to try and spread the word a little to see if anybody felt led to help my mom. I have already secretly talked to her boss and he graciously gave special permission for her to take unpaid time off since she's a new employee at the company.Now that we got her the time off, we just need to see if we can get the money together to book her flight to Brazil. No pressure here. Certainly this is a unusual request and it goes without saying that nobody would be obligated to give. If you feel led to, please only give whatever you're comfortable with. I appreciate you taking the time to read and consider this.Please share with anybody that you think would be interesting in helping. Just don't share with Selmy or any member of my family since it's a surprise. (: Thank you so much!Blessings,Melissa Elbert

Hi everyone! I know many of you by now know Katelyn's story and the journey that we have gone through with her. Although we are so lucky to be in a safe place now, it is because we are constantly being diligent with her medical care. We see Dr. H 3 times a year in New York and once a year in Chicago. Chicago is a great oppurtunity for us to interact with other families that have RSS, because it is so rare. It is the only time she gets to see other kids that are like her. It gives us a chance to hear the latest up to date medical research and learn the ins and outs to things like battling insurance appeals and the schools when necessary. It's also great to catch up with other parents and find out how they survived certain things. We have also added traveling to South Carolina for her leg issues and soon we will be going to Cincinnati for her ENT issues. Although things may appear great on the surface, trust me, there is lot of running behind the scenes. I am so thankful for the support thateveryone provides to our daughter. It would not be possible without everyone's help. So, as registering for another Magic Convention is already upon us, again we are asking that anyone who is able to help to please contribute what you can. If you can't financially contribute weunderstand,but please take a moment to share this site so maybe someone else can. Thank you everyone!

                        I have had many people contacting me about donating to CRPS UK in lieu of Christmas presents and sending cards, so I have decided to keep my Gofundme page open until the new year. Thank you to everyone for your continued support in helping CRPS UK realise their dreams of becoming the first CRPS specific charity in the UK. We hope to have more news on developments in the new year and information about upcoming events and my next challenge.Wishing you you all much love, happiness and good health during the festivities and 2015.Amanda :-) xxxHello all, thank you for taking the time to visit my fundraising page. I am fundraising for CRPS UK through myCycling for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome awareness campaign. CRPS UK is a cause dear to my heart, as my sister and Iboth have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).The money I raise will be used to help CRPS UK become a registered charity and to improve primary care education about CRPS.This years challenge:October 30th - November 3rd 2014OnOctober 30, I will set off on a four day ride, from my home in Wiltshire to Snowdonia, a distance of approx. 200miles. I will average 70 miles a day in the first two days, and only 30 miles a day on the latter two, to allow for the elevation in Wales. I know, compared to last years ride, this seems like it will be a walk in the park. But unfortunately,due to being very ill for 8 months (non CRPS related),I was forbidden to ride during that time, therefore unable to train. That,coupled with I am now showing symptoms of the spread of CRPS in my cycling leg (the right one), and the effect the cold damp weather has,means this is my maximum achievable goal at the moment.OnNovember3rd,I will be met by the Mayor of Bangor, Councillor JeanForsyth, and here I will complete the challenge by doing Velocity, a mile long zip wire,the longest in Europe. This I know, is going to be the most difficult part of thechallenge, due to the position I will be in on the zip wire and the increase in my pain levels. Once I have completed my challenge I will be taking a long break to recover. During the challenge, I will be supported by my wonderful boyfriend Nick in the backup vehicle.He will drive each day to my lunch time and final destinations, then get on his trike, ride to meet me and we will cycle the remaining miles together. He will also be mechanical support and assist with getting me to the start of and onto the zip wire.I have chosen these dates to coincide with an initiative by'Color The World Orange' to make the firstMondayin November, a global annual CRPS Awareness Day.I could not do this challenge without the support and sponsorship of some very generous companies. They are:Rutland Cycling -donated weatherproof clothing.DV Camera Hire - donated a Go Pro helmet camera.Schwalbe, UK donated four Marathon tyres and inner tubesSports Massage Bedford - who have assisted me with nutrition.Zip World - who have givenus two tickets to a ride on the Velocity zipwire.Wiggle - donated clothing.Signs n Stuff & R Temlett Builders- printed t-shirts. Redroofs B&B, Tenbury Wells - Thank you Mike and Jane for very kindly giving us accommodation on the first night.The Royal Oak Hotel, Welshpool - Thank you Samfor very kindly giving us accommodationon the second night.Heulfre Bed and Breakfast, Corwen Thank you Malcolm and Sheila for very kindly giving us accommodation on the third night. The Joys of Life, Bethesda, Snowdonia -Thank you Drs. Wendy & Ieuanfor kindlygiving us accommodationonthelast night.Withy King - who donated a large amount towards the cost of my recumbent trike and continue to support me with printing leaflets and promotional material.Thank you all from thebottom of my heart. x Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a rare neurological disorder, which causes chronic pain that cannot be controlled and can affect all areas of the body but most commonly occurs in the limbs. It isa debilitating and disabling inflammatory condition that can be caused by minor injury (sprain), broken/fractured bones,surgeryor canappear spontaneously without known cause. CRPS is believed to be the result of dysfunction in the central or peripheral nervous systems where the signals between the affected limb or body part and the brain are misinterpreted resulting in the following :-burning pain-hypersensitivity of the skin-changes in skin temperature: warmer or -coolercompared to the opposite extremity-changes in skin colour: often blotchy, purple, pale, or red-changes in skin texture: shiny and thin, and sometimes excessively sweaty-changes in nail and hair growth patterns-swelling and stiffness in affected joints-motor disability, with decreased ability to move the affected body partCRPS can strike anyone at any age and affects both men and women, but statistics show it is more common in women.Very little is known or understood about CRPS and there is no cure.My left leg is substantially affected by CRPS, which began in 2011 after a number of soft tissue injuries and a rare congenital foot deformity (then undiagnosed). I was diagnosed with CRPS 2012, 18 months from the start of the soft tissue injuries. The lack oftimely appropriate treatment, caused my CRPS to worsen. I am currently showing signs of CRPS in my right leg too, CRPS can spread along limbs or jump to other parts of the body. For some people, this means that they experience symptoms over the whole of their body.I currently use crutches for walking short distances and a wheelchair for anythingmore than a few yards.I also enjoy hiking on an off road mobility scooter and have an assistance dog who helps me out with all sorts of tasks. 10% of all money raised will be donated to Dog A.I.Dwho are training my dog Dyson to be my support.I have always been a very active person and when my CRPS became severe, I struggled to do any sort of activity. The loss of independence and being unable to do the things I loved, lead me into a severe depression and I hit rock bottom.I realisedI needed help, which Isought from my GP, a councillor and a charity called Charlotte's Tandems 's. Riding a tandem allowed me to be active again and despite the pain, I loved it. I felt free for the first time in a couple of yearsand this is where the Cycling for Complex Regional Pain initiative started. Previous cycle challenges and fundraising eventsAugust 4th 2013 - Ride London 100A 100 mile sportive, a legacy of the 2012 Olympic road race route in London and around the Surrey Countryside.Rode on a tandem.September 9th - September 29th - Lands End to John O'GroatsI cycled 1140 miles from Lands End to John O'Groats, zig-zagging across the UK, meeting with the press, doctors, researchers, charities and other sufferers of CRPS. However, disaster struck just under a month away from starting my challenge; I lost one of my front riders on the tandem.Unable to do the challenge without them, I started looking for other options and found a recumbent trike,with a lot of help from generous donators I bought one. This allowed me to not only complete my challenge, but to do it under my own steam with just practical support. The money raised was donated to The Pain Relief Foundation, Charlotte's Tandems and The Royal Wootton Bassett Town Rotary Club (End Polio Now).December 12th 2013The Athena Network -Swindon,a local company, held their annual Christmas lunchand fund raising event for CRPS, which raised over 2000. This money was split equally between The Pain Relief Foundation and CRPS Services (adult and child)at theRNHRD, Bath, one of the few CRPS specialist clinics in th UK. This year, ill health meant that I had to put my awareness and fundraising campaigns on hold but now I am back and more ambitious than ever. It has been hard for me to get back into condition to complete my next challenge but I am condfident I will achieve it.Thank you for reading.Please consider donatingand helpingCRPS UKto reach their target,which willenable them to become a registered charity.It will bethe first CRPS specific charity in the UK. Many thanks in advance and best wishesAmanda :o) x

                        On Christmas day 2013 leaving one family's house headed to the next family's house we were involved in a head on collision. It was a very tragic accident resulting in my 13 month old daughter Lexi's death. This has been a very hard year for myself and my family. We have went through surgeries and I have had a lot of complications since. But with Christmas approaching quickly we are not ready to face that day just yet. for Christmas this year I would like to be able to put a smile on children's faces and there family as well. We would like to give gifts to the children in the hospital on Christmas day but we need your help. So many of you were there for us when we needed you last year, and hoping you would like to help again. We will take donations of any amount or any kind of toys, clothes,  blankets, anything. Items need to be new and unused. My email is hooperkelsey7@gmail.com feel free to contact me.

The Raw.Honest.Loved. Project is a photo project that has involved 86 participants in the Tacoma, WA area so far.

It is a project based on combatting personal insecurities with the love and positivity of community.

We have done ten groups so far, involving men and women of many different backgrounds and ages. You can see more at  www.alanatphotography.wordpress.com.



The opportunity has arisen for us to take the project to a group of teenagers in the small town of Decorah, Iowa. A high-school senior there, Rebecca, became acquainted with the project via Facebook. She decided to make it a part of an end-of-year assignment. Meanwhile, as we talked, she spoke of her small high school community being quite familiar with loss. They have lost five teens in the last few years, two to accidents, three to suicide. In the span of us getting acquainted, she lost yet another friend to suicide.

Suicide seems to sadly have become some sort ofepidemic. I don't know what we need to do to change this, but, I believethat communication is key. This subject needs addressed. Teenagers need to feel heard, understood, validated. This project is a step in that direction. This group will help a small group of teen girls understand that they are not alone and hopefully equip them to relate to andhelp others.

Please help us to make this trip a reality. We are holdingthis group in late April. The money raised will help cover the cost of the trip and equipment rental. We appreciate your help. The girls, my assistant, and I are allexcited about taking the project to Iowa.(FaceTimeing with Rebecca)

James' Graduation Vacation,"$2,450 ","$4,000 ",Events," February 23, 2016",40,7,,,117000,,7,"






                            Denise Grumpee Panda Klawitter
                            
                            
                                                    



Hi, I'm Denise and if you don't know me, I am married to a wonderful man named James Klawitter.  I set up this travel fund for him. I have never asked anyone for money before, but I think he's worth it, so swallowing my pride... here goes nothing.In May 2016, James will be graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality Management. So what's special about that? First, he's 34 years old and probably a decade older than most of his fellow graduates. More importantly though is how he got there. 

When I met James, almost 10 years ago, his relationship with the educational system was, lets say, less than perfect. No one could deny that he was bright, probably more than most, but somewhere along the line his educational social network missed that he was not engage in the traditional learning environment he was in. He saw school as a waste of time obligation one had. A place where adults did not really care if you were there or not. His age inappropriate ideas and ways of looking at the world, were met with rebuff. By the time he graduated from high school, he knew he needed the certification of an education, but was thoroughly convinced that their was no place for him in that system. This plus his depression and his outsider feelings caused, in part, by trying to maintain an authentic self while remaining casually closeted, led him to an unsuccessful college career. He began to believe that maybe he was able to do college level work, and developed a fear of educational institutions, which he masked with a kind of arogance that only those who didn't really know him believed. By the time I met him, going to college was out of the question for him. 

Over-time I slowly coaxed him back to higher education. First with a certificate program... short, entirely without pressure on pathway, and non-academic. He chose to do carpentry and, with some gentle coaching on studying and managing classroom work, he successfully completed that program. Less afraid, he insinuated that he might actually try a degree program. As a faculty member at a Community College, my spouse gets tuition free, so I encouraged him to seek within himself, what he thought he might like. He ultimately completed an associate degree in Hospitality Management in 3 years and then transfered well to his current school. When he graduates, he will have completed 2 additional years of school for his Bachelors with a GPA well in excess of 3.5. What is totally remarkably is he managed to do 4 years of college in 5 years while working full-time. On top of which, my healthy has been rapidly declining which means he gave up every day off (rare as those were), every vacation, to help me with medical needs. In that time I had 2 surgeries, near 2 weeks of hospitalization with life threatening conditions, one year on medical leave with reduced pay, and 2 cat adoptions because I needed companionship.

At the beginning of this college journey, I had promised James that I would take him on vaction to somewhere not in the Americas. He had never been outside the are and I promised him I would. Unfortunately, my health issues plus school costs, has eaten up much of our funding. At this point, I am pretty sure that within the next academic year, short of a miracle, I will beforced to leavemy job (integrity and my body demands) and what money I have is basically insurance not to fall into poverty. If I want to keep his very deserved vacation promise, this is my only real option. I don't expect I'll reach the expected amount, but that is roughly what I think I will need. The closer I get to that amount, the more likely we can go. If anyone has excess American Airlines (affiliates) points that can be used for a flight, that would also be appreciated. 

Thanks for listening.By the way, I'd love if some of you showed up for his graduation from Fairleigh Dickinson University - Metropolitan Capmpus. It is on May 17th at the Metlife Stadium at the Meadowlands. There is no limit on tickets as far as we can tell so let me know if you're coming. If you can't be ther but want to watch, there will be aWebcast for family or friends who will not be able to attend the Commencement event, the event will be webcast at  http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/commencementwebcast.html.

                        Hello dearest Primos! In preparation for our Cuzunion festivities being planned for next month, October 15, I have created this Fund Me account in hopes of raising funds to help improve Nana's house to host us that weekend.There was a lot of interest in having the Sunday morning menudo there. The house certainly could use some TLC and Elbow Grease. Yes, I know the house doesn't belong to us, but it is and forever will be Nana's in our hearts. It was the place that housed many a party and dinner and barbecue/picnics. I can't see how we could gather there without doing something to prepare and improve it. I know Nana would be very happy to see us working together on it. Perhaps some of us could get together the Friday before and Saturday morning to make it purty!There is tremendous power and ability in numbers and we certainly have the numbers!! We also have Time, Treasure, or Talent to offer to it for our time together, so I hope you will find it in your heart to see this project through.I really didn't know what monetary goal to put forth so I chose a number and put 40 donations of $25 each. It would be wonderful if we could give a facelift to the backyard barbecue to cook the menudo in, and to put up tables and make the backyard attractive to house us all.I really would love to hear your ideas for face-lifting, repairing, putting a bandaid on the kitchen and bathroom for our use that weekend. We only have a few weeks, so I would like to ask for the deadline for funds be set for Sept. 25 to give us time to budget/plan for the projects. I will be happy to keep a list of anybody that can donate their time that week to help out with anything there, and for people who can donate supplies, tables, chairs for setup. If anybody is thinking of buying a new set of pots and pans and wonders what they are going to do with the old set, please speak up. I am sure we could use them! Please be as generous as you can; lots to do!As we know we are....the power in our numbers, working together to have a wonderful Cuzunion, is a great sign of our wonderful familia!!Thank you for listening, (or not)!! ;)Love you and see you all next month!Cindy

                        Hello everyone my name is LeAnn and this is my 2 year old son Thorin. I am a recently divorced single mom and I am trying to get on my feet. I am blessed to have family, friends, and single parent assistance to help with his care and needs while I am working to get on my feet (finding job and going to school). But as you probably know everyone is struggling these days just to survive day to day so there is only so much everyone can do. I have started this up so hopefully I can get help with buying his Christmas from Santa and some Winter clothes since he is constantly growing out of old clothes. I am doing everything  I can to try and get his Christmas and Clothes including offering to do odd jobs, looking into local churches, and even trying to apply for Christmas assistance programs. I am hoping that there are a few kind souls that will donate and help because every cent is going to help even if I don't reach the set goal. Thorin is my world and I just want him to have good Christmas. He deserves it after all we have been through this year.  Please help  him get a good Christmas from Santa. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.

                        The Niagara Regional Powwow is about bringing all the people together to celebrate love, unity, and the freedom to celebrate our Indigenous traditions. Every dollar that we crowdsource is another dollar that we don't have to take from corporate, government or institutional sponsors. Making a contribution to this Powwow sends the message that you want Indigenous culture to thrive freely and to be a part of your Niagara.Please join us on September 25th at Noon, at 382 Airport Rd, Niagara on the Lake for a family friendly event to which alll are welcome.In the 70's when the St. Catharines Indian Centre - the precursor to the Niagara Regional Native Centre - was founded there were no strong bridges connecting the cultures of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. When the Native Centre was incorporated in 1974 the Powwow Committee was the first committee established. The early Powwows became a way to establish a relationship of mutual understanding and respect between members all the communities in Niagara.Nowadays the relationship between Canadians and First Nations are undergoing growth as the harsh truths of history are becoming known more broadly. In these times of healing coming together for gatherings like the NRNC Powwow are more important than ever. This year the Powwow will be honouring Indigenous adoptees and welcoming a group of local adoptees to experience all the love and positive energy that the Niagara community has to offer.All are welcome to attend this family friendly celebration of Indigenous culture which as previously mentioned is at 382 Airport Rd, Niagara-on-the-Lake, just off the QEW, on Sunday, September 25th, 2016. The Grand Entry, which is the official commencement of the event, starts at noon and the festivities will carry on until the flags are retired between 4 and 5 pm. This drug and alcohol free event is the perfect opportunity to share in the richness of Indigenous culture by enjoying traditional dancing, drumming, singing, crafts, food and drink, and community spirit.Please nurture our efforts and make a small contribution to an event that supports local businesses, artisans and the people who have dedicated their lives to preserve our roots as Indigenous people.Event updates and information are available on our Facebook page

Ohlin's Bakery in Belmont Rebuild,"$22,326 ","$50,000 ",Events," July 19, 2016",478,2,BELMONT,MA,2700,,4,"

                                                            on behalf of Marybeth Klemm

BELMONT, MA                                





                        Just so you know this is real and going to the Ohlin's Bakery owners. Here is a screen shot of their Facebook endorsing this Go Fund Me.I chose $50,000 since we don't have a number that they need so lets exceed it!On March 15, 2016, a staple in Belmont, MA, Ohlins Bakery, exploded. One stack of doughnut pans was all that separated baker Paul Klemm from disaster Tuesday morning as the oven at his Belmont bakery exploded just feet from where he stood.If it wasnt for me behind those pans . . . it wouldve done some serious damage, Klemm, the owner of Ohlins Bakery, said at the scene. Thats what saved me.He had just walked behind the pans  stacked 6 feet tall  when something ignited the gas that had collected in the large industrial oven that he had turned on moments earlier.The blast around 2:45 a.m. was powerful enough to blow out a brick wall and partially collapse a roof at the popular century-old family business, but Klemm escaped with only his hair and eyebrows singed by the flames.Im lucky to have no marks on me, he said. I really wasnt hurt, and I was less than 6 feet away.Klemm had just walked behind the stack of sheet pans when the blast rang out. He had been standing next to the oven just seconds before the explosion.Its really a miracle that I had moved from that spot, he said. I could feel all the pressure around me.One other bakery worker was in the building at the time, but he was not harmed.The blast also knocked out two windows at a barber shop that shares a wall with the bakery. Construction workers Tuesday morning were placing wooden panels where the glass had been.A large pile of bricks surrounded the back door of Ohlins, and the area was blocked off by police tape. The roof showed obvious signs of damage.The exact cause of the explosion is still under investigation, Fire Chief David Frizzell said at the scene.Donata Barber, who owns a consignment shop on the other side of the bakery, said she was relieved when she arrived and saw that nothing in her store was broken.I thought it was a miracle I didnt have any damage, considering all the glass and fragile stuff I have, she said. My heart goes out to these guys. Its a miracle nobody got hurt.The bakery, which celebrated its 100th-anniversary last fall, has the best donuts in town, Barber said.It even made the Globe Magazines recent list of Bostons 13 greatest doughnut shops.Barber said when she was a young girl, her mother took her to Ohlins every year to get birthday cakes. The shop hasnt changed since.I dont know where Im going to get my donuts with my coffee break this morning, Barber said.On July 19, 2016, the owners ofOhlin's Bakery posted the following message on their Facebook Page. Dear Customers,A lot of you have messaged us asking when we will be reopening, and for the longest time we really had no idea. We have learned that the landlord will be rebuilding the damaged part of the building soon. Her insurance company will pay to make it into a retail store ----- not a bakery. A bakery has special requirements, and we would be responsible to make it into a bakery. The problem is a bakery would need different code up grades than just a retail store, such as... a certain kind of flooring, fire suppression system, walls, new sinks, electrical up grades, plumbling up grades, plans from architect, etc.Our insurance company will pay for the things that were damaged during the explosion, like the oven for instance. Our biggest problem is our insurance will not cover any code upgrades that we need. We are trying to figure out how much all this will cost us. We will need to see if this is something we can personally afford. We are incredibly nervous and stressed about the unknown. It is difficult telling you all this information, as we wish it was all good news, but unfortunately this is what we are trying to deal with at this time. We were hoping the insurance would cover everything we needed, so that we could have confidently told you we would be opening soon.Our family has been in the bakery business for 100 years and we would like to continue to bake again. We love baking and feel proud that we have won recognition as a bakery, and for our donuts! We want more than anything to get back to doing what we do best. We pray that this will be possible.We miss all our customers and want to see you all again! We love that you miss us and send us messages every day!

SAINT PETERSBURG, FL                                




HISTORIC CAMPAIGN: The first beauty and self-esteem campaign/movement in the history of the world for dark skin women and girls! The History of the Dark Skin is Beautiful CampaignI am the dark skinned activist, Rashida Strober. Before Social Media, and the prevalence of the internet I have been advocating for the beauty of dark skin women and girls from a grassroots level. My advocacy began in 1998 with a speech given at St. Petersburg College about the beautiful Sudanese Model Alek Wek. I spoke about the hatred she received by many who said she was not the standard of beauty for black women.  Since that time I have poured my heart and soul into building the self- esteem of the next generation of dark skin women and girls as well as all dark skin women and girls world-wide. We can no longer sit by while the world continues to ignore the beauty of dark skin. We can no longer sit by watching the billion dollar skin lightening industry consume the self esteem of dark skin beauty on an international scale. I realized that I must use my God given talents and lived experiences as a dark skin woman to propel the dark skin is beautiful campaign to the next level. In 2006 I wrote the play A Dark Skin Womans Revenge.  Through the writing, producing and performance of A Dark Skin Woman's Revenge aka Darkism the next level of the campaign was spearheaded. Since 2010 I have personally financed all previous productions of the play, which has been performed at venues like the Prestigious Atlanta Black Theatre Festival and the University of South Florida. Now I am asking for your help to spread the message of the dark skin is beautiful campaign and to take it to the international level! Its never been a time like right now to support this campaign! MAKE HISTORY! DONATE NOW!YOUR DONATIONS WILL FUND1.A world-wide Darkism Campaign which include world wide travel for campaign speeches and conferences to promote the campaign 2.The writing, self- publishing, marketing and World- wide distribution of the book A Dark Skin Woman's Revenge, Darkism and other publications to help millions of dark skin women and girls world-wide realize and bolster their beauty.3.World -wide performances of the play A Dark Skin Woman's Revenge aka Darkism.DARK SKIN GIRL POVERTY FUNDWhen 1 million dollars in revenue is reached from the products of the dark skin is beautiful campaign 10 percent of the revenue will go to a Dark Skin Girl Poverty Fund. This fund will help dark skinned girls 0 to 23. I was once dark skinned, homeless abused and raped. I was dark skinned and ignored. I had no one to help me. I had to fight my way out to become someone in life. I dont want other dark skinned girls or go through this. You all have a responsibility to assist in the building of this campaign. DO IT NOW!BIO  RASHIDA STROBER aka The Dark Skinned ActivistA HELL OF A SUCCESS STORYEven if youre going through hell, keep going! This is one of Rashidas most inspiring quotes by the motivational king, Les Brown. Rashida knows about going through hell. A Florida native, Rashida is the only girl among 6 siblings. She was born into what seemed like hell on earth, yet through it all, she discovered a burning desire to become a talented performer. At a young age Rashida was destined for success as she won numerous acting awards, including a prestigious Ruth Eckerd Hall Scholarship and the Florida Thespian Festival Superior award. The St. Petersburg Times wrote about her crowning achievements at the tender age of 13. Soon after, lifes trials shook the foundation of her chances at achieving her dream. Rashidas self- esteem was brutally assaulted at every turn by classmates who made her life a living hell. Known as black and ugly monkey mouth and African Booty Scratcher, she was told by many that she would never make it as an actress. Living on the streets and all alone by the age of 14, Rashida endured poverty and sexual exploitation. Although homeless, beat down, busted and disgusted with life, Rashida held fast to her dream of acting.With Gods help she escaped the poverty and sexual abuse and by age 17, she earned a GED, found employment, saved money for an apartment and enrolled in college. After graduating from the University of South Florida with a Masters Degree in Political Science, Rashida moved to LA to pursue her acting dream. In 2006 she wrote, produced and starred in her autobiographical one-woman show, The Ice Cream Ladys Dream. Inspired by the dark skin mental abuse of the main character and a lecture Rashida delivered on dark skin in 1998 at St. Petersburg College, she decided to write A Dark Skin Womans Revenge in the summer of 2006. This groundbreaking play spurred an international movement recognizing the beauty plight of dark-skinned women and girls. After three years in LA Rashida relocated to St. Petersburg. After returning she continued to write, speak and perform the play with the theme of uplifting dark skin beauty. She taught in Pinellas County Schools and St. Petersburg College and appeared on televisions The Forensic Files and various theatrical productions, including TV Commercials. Rashida launched the website Actortube.com, a video sharing site to promote actors, actresses and performers and in 2008 she founded ICLD Productions. ICLD is the first production company of its kind, producing plays specifically about the dark-skinned female experience. Since 2006, Rashida has been performing as 5 characters in the groundbreaking play A Dark Skinned Womans Revenge. Select venues include The University of South Florida, The Atlanta Black Theatre Festival and The Washington DC Black Theater Festival.Rashida has been recognized by her peers for her stellar acting talents. In 2012, she won the Playwrights Red Carpet Award. She won Actress of the Year for her heart wrenching performance as Georgana Nelson, a badly treated dark skinned, mentally ill woman in A Dark Skin Womans Revenge. Rashida has been featured in local and national newspapers and on numerous television programs. In 2013 she made the cover of the Floridian Magazine.Rashida is on a mission to change the world for dark skinned people. Her talents as an actor and orator are reflected in her ongoing efforts as The Worlds First Dark Skinned Activist. In 2014 Rashida made history. Inspired by the play A Dark Skin Womans Revenge, she created the International Dark Skin is Beautiful Campaign, the first in the world to uplift the beauty of dark skinned women and girls. An expert on the plight of dark skinned women and girls, Rashida tours the country speaking about the issue of dark skinned beauty. Sought after for her unique views and expertise on dark skin, Rashida has appeared on numerous talk shows including The Tommy Sotomayor Show, Questions of a Lifetime and was seen by millions as the feature story on Bay News 9. The highly anticipated book version of the play is available at rashidastrober.com You can also find other books written by Rashida including, Darkism:25 ways dark skin people are discriminated against, How to be the hottest dark skinned chick on the planet and She Black But she aint ugly: A dark skin girls triumph.Rashida is one of the lead panelists on the Girls Change the World Workshop in Pinellas County Schools. She is also a keynote for the Great American TeachIn.

FARMINGTON, UT                                




My name is Creston Inderrieden and I was fortunate enough to play under Coach Downs in the mid 90s. For the past year I've been soliciting the school to allow us to name the court in Coach's honor upon his retirement; which is now just weeks away. I just received word that the powers that be have given us permission to honor Coach in this very special way...we just have to raise the $$$...to which I stated, NO PROBLEM!Coach has been at the school from the very beginning and has literally impacted thousands of people for good. Coach although large in stature, has one of the gentlest hearts I've ever known. I know there are many others who share the same fondnessfor Coach that I do, and that will want to participate in this amazing opportunity. Please help by passing this campaign on to as many Farmington Junior High Alumni as possible! 100% of the funds will go to honoring Coach, includinginstalling a graphic which will name the court in his honor.We are going to honor Coach after the boy's basketball game on November 17th, at approximately 4:45. We'd lovefor as many people as possible to come out andshow your love and support. ALL OF THIS IS HUSH HUSH...COACH DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING YET...LET'S TRY TO KEEP IT A SURPRISE!!!Should you have any questions, or want to help...please LMK!Cheers,Creston

Let's help fix Inelia's boat home,"$26,871 ","$30,000 ",Events," February 17, 2015",492,19,NEAH BAY,WA,2600,9,18,"

NEAH BAY, WA                                




In my life, I haven't really ""asked for support"" for a personal project. The support I request is usually for a collective need, such as the Global Ascension Center, or Ascension101. But for personal support, there was never an opportunity for me to actively ask for support. When I heard how much money it will cost to repair some key areas of our boat's hull (which is our home), the first thing I thought of was, ""I'll ask for support from my audience, start a crowdfunder or something like that"". Which was soon after blocked by... ""how does one do that?"" And then I hit a program which said, ""asking for help for your personal life is wrong"". When I looked at that program I was really surprised it was there because the individuals who follow my work, and hang out with me, are extremely supportive all the time, and would be really happy to be part of an inflow of energy and well being into my personal life. Yet, every time I looked, that program would kick in. It felt artificial and external, but there was something in my own field where it latched on, or it wouldn't have affected me.So, I asked a bunch of friends at Walk With Me Now to look at this particular program with me. And the energy started freeing instantly. Before I knew it, I was ready to ask! The block was very simple, it assumed limits and lack of where the support could go, and projects that benefited others were ""more important"" than my basic physical needs. How come we live on a boat?I had been asked by Source, Gaia, the Human Collective, to stay, live and work in California for many years. But at the start of 2014, it asked me to leave. In fact it was very insistent that I leave! But by now I had been in California for nearly 10 years and had a life there. Two of my children live there, my ex-husband and close friend lives there. And I had nowhere else to live. So, I procrastinated moving out. The result was that I got extremely sick for months. There were a couple of close calls, when I nearly didn't make it.But I stayed!In September 2014, I had the opportunity to spend some hours with my friend Larry. A man who lived all the way up on the very tip of Washington State, so we didn't get to hang out very often. We'd originally met in 2011, at one of my public events. He was then very active in most events, volunteering, helping out and even organizing some too. We also became collaborators on a couple of projects, and would often hang out with friends. He was like a brother to me. Or one of the girls. Completely invisible as a man, or possible partner. In fact, the thought was so ridiculous, when someone finally verbalized it to me after a mutual friend's birthday party (they thought we were secret lovers), I thought it was hilarious and also impossible.Normally, when he left California, he would also leave my attention. When he was gone, he was really gone. And he wouldn't pop up in my attention field until he sent me a text or Facebook message. But this time, this time not only was his visit different (I noticed two things: one that he was a man, and the other that he was extremely handsome), but after he left, he sent a continuous flow of text messages, which meant he did not disappear from my consciousness.The second day after he left, I looked at all the messages on my phone, and realized that our discourse was not over. That our conversation needed to be had and concluded... Long story short, some serious fires engulfed the areas around Sacramento, where I lived. My asthma kicked in, and I was not able to procrastinate my exit from California any longer. I packed my car, my dog, and drove North West toward the coast. He suggested I travel to where he lives, as the air is clean, cooler and the sea is all around.It's now February 2015, and we moved in together... onto a liveaboard boat. Another amazing surprise is that living on a boat on the sea was one of my most cherished dreams. A dream I had actually given up on. When we tried to rent a house, any house, we found really crazy blocks coming up. We realized we were not looking for the right thing. Then his mother said to me, why not a houseboat? And I thought... whoa, that is one of my life long dreams. So I asked him if he wanted to live on a boat. And guess what! That was his lifelong dream too... figures.We found an amazing boat - a beautiful wooden trawler-yacht from 1961 designed by William Garden. The price was really low, so we didn't have to get into debt to buy it due to the extensive repairs it needed. Some planks in the hull have dry rot, as do some ribs, and the ""house"" needs a bunch of caretaking done too. When we posted our predicament in Walk With Me Now, someone immediately volunteered to help us with the house repairs. So that brings our total bill down many thousands of dollars (thank you Hopi!!)This campaign is to repair the hull, which can only be done by shipwrights (expensive) and it will make our new home sound and safe to be in the water.

Chesty Puller House - Veterans,"$33,569 ","$100,000 ",Events," August 13, 2015",303,13,WASHINGTON,DC,2600,,12,"






                            Maleesha Kovnesky
                            
                            
                                                           
WASHINGTON, DC                                




THE NEED:Did you know that 22 veterans are committing suicide EVERY DAY in America? Lewis Burwell ""Chesty"" Puller was a United States Marine Corps lieutenant general and one of the most decorated members of the Marine Corps. Puller is the only Marine and one of two US servicemen to ever be awarded five Navy Crosses.Some do not know that Chesty's Puller's son, Lewis Burwell Puller, Jr. (generally known as Lewis Puller), served as a Marine lieutenant in the Vietnam War. While serving with 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines (2/1), Lewis Jr. was severely wounded by a mine explosion, losing both legs and parts of his hands. ChestyPuller broke down sobbing at seeing his son for the first time in the hospital. On May 11, 1994 Puller Jr. died due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. The Vietnam-wounded son of a WWII hero - Chesty, a man still revered today - his son killed himself. We like to think that we have better support systems in place today, but the truth is, we have a long way to go.Serious issues continue to this day - the bureaucracy within the VA and the backlog of injured vets contributes to the high number of servicemen and servicewomen who just cannot take it anymore. THE PLAN:It just so happens that the current owners of Chesty Puller's house are selling it. That's right - CHESTY'S HOUSE IS FOR SALE on a lovely 3.37 acres of Virginia greenery.We want to make the Chesty Puller Home a place of refuge for those who are in need ofhelp.WHO WE ARE:Our non-profit group, 3000+ strong USMC Family, is negotiatingto purchase this house and make it a place for veterans to stay for short periods of time to get back on their feet. We have spoken with the local realtor, zoning board, and have gotten clearance to make this a reality.  Now comes the hard part - getting the money. We are looking into loans as well as fundraising, but we have little time to get things put together as the attention given to this house has exploded since it went viral on the interwebs. Our group specializes in doing all we can to prevent veteran suicide. This will be our flagship undertaking. All donations received will be placed into a trust - no one individual will benefit from this effort. Should we fail to raise the money for this, every cent of money raised will be donated toInjured Marines Semper Fi Fund and Fisher House Foundation (both of which have A or A+listings at charitywatch.org). https://www.charitywatch.org/ratingsandmetrics.php?charity_id=536 https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/fisher-house-foundation/531HOW WE WILL KEEP IT RUNNING:Our plans to continue funding the home after it is purchased include keeping one of the rooms open for rental from anyone - meaning you could sleep under the same ceiling as Chesty did! This probably means a lot more to you if you were a Marine or related to a Marine or just love the military, but we believe this is a great source of continued funding.Also, we would rent the grounds of the Puller home for weddings, reunions, and other events. The property would be occupied by veterans who refrained from drug and alcohol use during their short term tenancy. Help to find counseling, patient advocacy, and a friendly ear will be things that veterans can find during their stay at the Puller House. The sky is the limit, and Chesty would want it this way. Owned by Marines, managed by Marines, and FOR Marines. (Other veterans will not be excluded). More details to come - we will be transparent with the funds and the plans for the home. This is a home FOR VETS BY VETS. Chesty's House

COSTS:The home is for sale now for $395K. We are (ASAP) turning in acash offer on this house and land with a 30 daycontingency - meaning if we don't have the cash in hand in 30 days we lose the contract and it goes to the next buyer.  We have local Marines on site who are visiting the house to ensure the worth is correct and that our offer is proper. Additional money here is needed to establish simple yet nice furnishings, develop the website and materials, as well as low budget marketing to places like MCL, VA, and other Veteran organizations to ensure awareness is raised that veterans have this option. No one will get paid from the money raised here. All of it will go into making the house and the various activities needed to establish the house a reality.Lastly, I have contacted GoFundMe to ask for a discount on the commission they take from each donation so that donors get more bang for their buck. I am not expecting a miracle, but I am going to try. HOW YOU CAN HELP:WE ARE SHORT ON TIME. We need to raise the money for this in 30 days. SPREAD THE WORD - OOH RAH!!!If you cannot donate, that's fine! Maybe just share our campaign to your social media accounts, or to friends and family that might be interested.Another great way to help is to click the little red heart at the top of this campaign. That helps this fundraiser gain popularity within GoFundMe and helps more eyeballs see it. Please help our organization purchase this home. We served our country as Marines, and now as Veterans we have no plans to stop serving. I am pleading with you to share this fundraiser with your friends and family, especially those with ties to the military.

                        I have been chosen as adelegate tothe Democratic National Convention in July, supporting Bernie Sanders. I am from Congressional District 7 in Wisconsin.I am trying to raise money tohelp with my travel, lodging and other expenses to attend the convention.I have supported Bernie since before he declared his candidacy. I am the head of the group Central Wisconsin for Bernie Sanders. My experiencein working for the Bernie campaign includes canvassing, phonebanking and organizing numerous other activities such as flyering, honk and waves, and debate watch parties. I have served as a volunteer Team Leader at 3 of Bernie's rallies here in Wisconsin. Last summer, I wrote and circulated a petition on Change.org, asking DWS and the DNC to add more debates to the schedule, and collected over 25,000 signatures. The petition was hand delivered to DWS's office in Washington, D.C.I worked closely with Bernie's staffers when they came to my town of Wausau, WI to help us get out the vote, by organizing and training canvassers, inputting computer information, and recruiting volunteers for the rally, and was honored to be chosen by Bernie's staffers to give the welcome speech at the rally in Wausau. I was very honored to be able to meet Bernie and Jane after the rally.I can assure you that there is no one who will fight harder than I, to see that Bernie receives the Democratic nomination!I appreciate any help you can give, even if it's just a few dollars! I hopeto raise money just as Bernie does; a little at a time, from a LOT of different people! Thank you my Bernie friends!

                        This campain fund is being established for the family of Officer Brent Thompson. Numerous people have called about setting up a donation point Brent's family, and we found this to be an easy avenue that can spead through social media.Officer Brent Thompson with the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Police, 43, was killed during Thursday nights sniper attack during a protest in Downtown Dallas.  Thompson, who was married just two weeks ago to a fellow transit officer, leaves many family and friends to grieve his loss. His former classmates, friends, neighbors and colleagues in CORSICANA, TX will fondly remember his years in his hometown and the work he dedicated his life to -- serving and protecting others.  Thompson began his law enforcement career as a Deputy with the Navarro County Sheriffs Department.  He later spent several years with the Corsicana Independent School District as a Police Officer and was a member of the City of Corsicana SWAT team.  He went on to serve as an international police trainer who mentored Iraqi and Afghan police before going to work for DART.  His family will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers.  https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/07/rip-officer-brent-thompson

                        Mitakuye pi (my relatives), Anpetu Waste (good day), Cante Waste ya Nape Ciyuzape (I want to greet you with a warm handshake from my heart). I am writing to you on behalf of the Tiospaye Sakowin Wounspe na Woapiye Otipi (Seven Extended Families Education and Healing Center) located in porcupine, SD. Research suggests that cultural awareness and strengthening the individuals self-esteem, cultural identity and language are key elements in preventing suicide, truancy problems, alcohol and drug use, abuse, teen pregnancy, and reducing health risk factors. There is an urgent need for increased cultural awareness and cultural activities that promote healthy lifestyles for all age groups. The need for cultural activities is critical due to the nonexistent programs and services geared toward helping the entire family, as well as the shortage and over expended health education, prevention, and service programs located within the Pine Ridge Reservation and other Indigenous communities. Tiospaye Sakowin Education and Healing Center is now gearing up for the secondLakota Koskalaka Wica Yuwita Pi - Lakota Young Men's Gathering of 2015. This event will be hosted the weekend of November 6th through the 9thon the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.In wake of the nine tragic suicides on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, a meeting was hosted by Tasunke Wakan Okolakiciye, Mila Yatan Pika Pte Oyate Okolakiciye and Oaye Luta Okolakiciye. An intense desire and need to help the youth and their families suffering from the impact of this epidemic, Tiospaye Sakowin was born and a strategic plan developed to continue to provide healing services to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. These organizations are the first of seven families to align in this effort to promote Lakota Cultural Healing and Education. We were quickly joined by Sung Nagi Okolakiciye(Spirit Horse Society) from Manderson, SD. Each of these organization provided unique attributes that provide healing and empowerment services to the Lakota Oyate. With room to grow, Tiospaye Sakowin will partner with seven organizations with like minds, missions and philosophy to strengthen and expand the impact of indigenous services. As you will see in the remainder of this proposal, community connectedness and the participation and support of the agency are immeasurable. Please join us in making this camp a success and impact the lives of the Lakota youth living on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.In 2003, a respectable elder the late Johnson Holy Rock stated If we lose our language we lose our identity as Lakota and our total way of life. The Tasunke Wakan Okolakiciye (Medicine Horse Society) works to provide Lakota cultural, language, and hands on education services to the Lakota Oyate to strengthen the individuals self-esteem, cultural identity and use of the Lakota language to promote healthy lifestyles within the family (tiwahe) and extended family (Tiospaye) in order to make an impact on the Oyate (community). Our mission statement is as follows; When the people followed the Lakota life ways and laws, the people flourished. Therefore, Tasunke Wakan Okolakiciye promotes the rebirth of the Lakota life ways and laws through education, healing, and collaboration.Primary goal of Tasunke Wakan Okolakiciye: Implement Lakol Wicohan (Lakota life ways and laws, which includes language, values, beliefs, ceremonies and laws of the Lakota people).Long term goals: 1) To revitalize and implement the Lakota language through education and practice.2) To strengthen the cultural identity of the Lakota Oyate through linking Lakota Philosophy with the Lakota language.3) To empower the Lakota Tiwahe (families) in reclaiming their Lakota identity, through integrating the Lakota Customary, Natural, and Spiritual law within the educational process. 4) To provide education training and assistance regarding cultural competency.Please join us in making this dream a reality for our youth. Wopila Tanka Iciciyapi, Tiospaye Sakowin Board, Staff and Volunteers!

                        This is what we should be supporting if you have monies to support something. Teaching and creating gardens so people can have natural organic healthy food to eat. Great job Yongo Otieno Wycliffe . This fund is to bring Yongo from Kenya Africa to the USA to teach and learn from us here at Angelite Center. This picture is an example of his work as he just made 3 portables using sacks ,soil and organic components. On a small piece of land this system of gardening will help the community gain some knowledge in producing varieties of crops and balance diet on just a small piece of land so they are not living on and eating corn every season. We are so excited to have him visit so we can teach him even more ways to garden and teach others to bring healthy foods to many. He already has his passport the money needed is for just for his visa and round trip ticket. I will take care and support him while he is here and if there is any extra money it will go to Youngo for spending money. Thank You! We reached our goal for his ticket but it turns out that getting the VISA is nearly impossable from Kenya to USA. I am asking for help now so we can hire an attorney to help Yongo get this VISA so he can come for his diplomatic journey.

NEWPORT BEACH, CA                                





                                                Please help us get Kevin to Spain!!! We have weeks to raise the funds to get his plane ticket. WE got him to Rome and kept him there for his 46 day hunger strike and now we can take this to a whole new level to end covert genocide, for our children, our future.Message from Kevin:I need your help to get to Spain.The medical community has invited me to present evidence of global genocide at the 3rd International Conference for Epidemiology and Emerging Diseases in Valencia, Spain, from August 4-6.This is a breakthrough for several reasons. First, it is a clear acknowledgement that my findings with respect to covert depopulation are valid. Second, it marks a break in the systems censorship abilities and that we have created a rift between the manipulators at the top and the manipulated in the ranks of the civil service, the medical and the scientific communities. And third, once I address the worlds doctors and scientists they will be fully on our side and will dismantle the system from within, as they will refuse to cooperate in genocide.I have submitted the following abstracts and both have been accepted:Abstract 1:The Subversion of Medicine and Public Health by International Security PrerogativesMedicine and public health have been gradually compromised by the highest echelons of science, industry and public administration, both nationally and internationally, for the geopolitical and geostrategic objectives of peaceful international cohabitation, preservation of vital natural resources, depopulation and decarbonization. Under the cover of reproductive health, involuntary and coerced sterilizations are carried out throughout the developing world through adulterated vaccines to bring the overpopulation problem under control, while in the developed world flu immunization programs serve to weaken the immune systems of the old and of civil servants to spare governments from meeting their already insolvent health care and pension plan obligations in the fourth and last stage of the demographic transition. Endocrine disruptors inserted in the basic elements of life  water, salt, milk, beverages, food, dental and cosmetic products  have been used, under the pretext of preventing caries and the spread of communicable diseases, since the early 1950s to chronically subvert the human reproductive system and bring down the total fertility rate of every country on earth to replacement level. In the name of sustainable development, experimental carbon capture and sequestration methods as well as solar radiation management methods double as weapons against human longevity throughout the developed world by subjecting billions of people to unnaturally high exposure levels of toxic heavy metals so the worlds decarbonization goals are tackled from two directions, by reducing greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere while at the same time increasing morbidity and mortality among the general population to proactively lower future emissions. Poverty and hunger are used as fronts for the deployment of genetically modified crops that purportedly increase yields, improve nutrition and require fewer fertilizers and pesticides, but that in fact misuse the latest bioengineering advances to cause subfertility, immune deficiencies and crop failures and thus lower the population by limiting births and increasing deaths. These chemical, biological and bacteriological methods are designed to weaken and confuse the autoimmune response of billions in preparation for naturally occurring pathogens or man-made pandemics, such as the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, that are engineered when and if the UN and its agencies, aided by the military-industrial complex, decide to implement final solutions to prevent select regions of the world from losing control of society and to aid backward countries in reaching the Millennium Development Goals.Abstract 2:The Epidemiology of Genocide: Medicine as the Handmaiden of Population ControlCovert depopulation methods carried out in the name of medicine and religion for more than a millennium have undermined the genetic and intellectual endowment of the human species and have led to moral and cultural degeneration. Monasticism, the bubonic plague, the Inquisition, the Crusades, the Counter-reformation and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic constitute a virtually uninterrupted social and scientific effort to prevent Christendom from outgrowing its food supply. With the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948, medicine became the central agent of covert depopulation and epidemiology its primary tool. Covert methods of population control employed in virtually every country on earth have lowered fertility to or near replacement level in all but fifty nations and one territory. Statistical and demographic data collated from across the world shows that prosperity follows drastic decreases in fertility and not vice versa, as it has been asserted for the past several decades.I cannot stress how important it is for all of us that I get to address the worlds doctors. This will create momentum for a change in the international system that I have been able to initiate through Peace Without Poison, the 1050-page book of scientific evidence of global genocide that I have published in March 2015 and that I am now making available to the general public free of cost here: http://objects.liquidweb.services/depopulation/Peace%20Without%20Poison.pdfAs a result of the pressure I have put on every head of state and government to abandon covert methods of depopulation many countries now refuse to cooperate with the depopulationists, the UN and its agencies have released statements identifying endocrine disruptors and GMOs as threats to public health, and the EU has committed to eliminating all endocrine disruptors from the environment by the end of 2016. Also as a result of Peace Without Poison several governments are now fully on our side: Sweden, France and Denmark being primary examples.The Canadian government and the depopulationists however have confiscated my passport on April 21 to saddle me with additional costs for a new passport in the hope that I will not have the necessary money to make it to Spain. They have refused to return my old passport and have failed to explain why. The Canadian government has also incarcerated me for a 7th time without cause for reasons that remain obscure but probably in the hope of breaking my resolve and so that I would miss work and hopefully lose my job and thus lack the money to pay for the trip. I describe this experience here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uy_IScrD4oLets show them that they will not be able to stop me.Help me get to Spain and bring the system of genocide down to its knees so that our children are safe again and have a future.

10 years ago, our community was rocked and horrified and our hearts were broken for a family that was ripped apart by murder and the kidnapping of two CDA young children by a monster whom I will not name. So many of us were sick over this story and I remember I just wanted to help this poor little 8 year old girl survivor of this unspeakable tragedy. There was no Go Fund Me at that time so I think it's fitting that we all show our love and support as she is expecting a little boy in March. Let's give her a HUGE ""baby shower gift"" from our community here in CDA by donating what you can to help Shasta and her finance' with the expenses of a new little baby. If this grows quickly, maybe they can go on a vacation or....whatever! She is a strong, resilient, beautiful woman and I am in awe of her. Please just donate what you can, let's show her our love and support.  Shasta will have full control over all money raised.

The Ohio Valley Indigenous Music Festival was formally known as the SunWatch Native Flute Festival and ran for nine years at SunWatch Indian Village in Dayton, OH. It was cancelled this year because of restructuring of priorities at SunWatch. I started this event and served on the committee all nine years, so even though it has been renamed and is at a new location, it has a long running track record of being a good event in this area. This year is it FREE and open to the public, so we are expecting over 2500 to attend over the weekend. You can find us on Facebook at facebook.com/TheOhioValleyIndigenousMusicFestivalUpon reorganizing the event, I wasn't able to find a new venue until March, 2016 and by then it was too late to start my own nonprofit and apply for grant money. So, this year we are relying solely on public donations and sponsors to fund the event. This year, my goal is to raise $6000 to cover the rental of a performance tent, staging & chairs, sound & lighting equipment, advertising, hotel & travel expenses for our performers, and the venue rental. The majority of our musicians perform music featuring the Native American flute, a very peaceful and healing instrument that has touched the hearts of millions. We will also have a few folk and traditional singers, including Chief Golden Light Eagle who is a hereditary Chief and Sundance Chief from the Yankton Sioux Reservation in S. Dakota, as well as several educational workshops and presentations. As a professional musician and voting member of the Grammys in the Producer's & Engineer's Wing since 2007, it is my goal to evolve The Ohio Valley Indigenous Music Festival to a national level and to be able to include some of the biggest names and Grammy winning Native American artists in that genre in the upcoming years.I, Douglas Blue Feather, want to personally thank you for your consideration in helping fund The Ohio Valley Indigenous Music Festival and making it a success. Together, we can make this local event a national event.

Renengade Pigs Milwaukee IronmenAs you may or may not know, The Renegade Pigs are proud supporters of National Concerns Of Police Survivors and Wisconsin Concerns Of Police Survivors. Every year C.O.P.S. hosts Kids Camp here in Wisconsin. What is C.O.P.S. Kids Camp?C.O.P.S. Kids Camp is a camp planned for surviving children ages 6-14 and their parent/guardian of law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty. C.O.P.S. Kids Camp provides family interaction, camp activities, grief counseling, relaxation and lots of old-fashioned fun! Campers have the opportunity to attend grief counseling sessions specifically designed for their needs and participate in activities such as swimming, fishing, arts and crafts, canoeing, ropes courses and campfire skits. The goal for campers is to leave the week with a continuing support system and a tremendous sense of personal growth and self- awareness for the future. It has been our pleasure assisting with the arrival of campers at General Mitchell International Airport along with escorts to camp by on duty club members and other area Motor Officers. Members of the Renegade Pigs Milwaukee Ironmen also host ice cream night where they provide and serve ice cream so that campers and staff are able to make sundaes. In 2014 we set a Bigger Long Term Goal. Families that attend the C.O.P.S. Kids Camp were required to bring items such as sheets, blankets, and towels. After speaking with many parents we learned that packing these linens for sometimes multiple surviving children along with themselves adds a huge addition to airline travel baggage fees.This is where you can continue to help. Your donations allowed The Milwaukee Ironmen to purchase 300 sets of sheets, pillow cases, blankets, beach towels, and 600 bath towels. With a donation from WI Concerns of Police Survivors we were able to purchase bins for storage. These linens will be delivered, picked up, laundered, and then stored for future campers as our ongoing commitment to C.O.P.S. and the families of fallen officers from all over the United States. Feel free to make donations for storage space, laundry expenses, and future replacements. We hope to never need more than 300 campers worth but if necessary purchase additional items.  https://www.facebook.com/RPMCMilwaukeeIronmen https://www.facebook.com/nationalcops http://www.nationalcops.org/programs.asp

NAPA, CA                                





                        I want to thank each and every one of you for your donation to support Rooter Bob. We are closing the campaign and wanted to notify you that the funds will be directed through my mother, Beverly Lake, and sent on to Rooter Bob. Since my attempt to close the campaign, more donations were given and I was not aware. I will gaurantee that every dollar will go to Rooter Bob.Most people in the Napa community know the man named Robert Zanardi. (More commonly known as Rooter Bob.) He is a unique individual who bleeds blue and gold and has always supported every facet of Napa High. Whether it is football, soccer, basketball, volleyball, cross country, tennis, baseball, wrestling, badminton, track, golf, water polo, swimming, dance, choir, band, drama, rallies, academic events, awards ceremonies or anything to do with Napa High, he is there. Over the course of his forty years with Napa High he has been a special education teacher, substitute teacher, and the biggest Napa Indians fan ever. Rooter Bob attends every Napa High event whether big or small. On behalf of the Napa High leadership and student body, on May 11, we would like to honor him at our scholarship ceremony with a nice gift basket and other items such as all new Napa High gear, a $500 gas card, a large custom framed picture collage of his time at Napa High, gift certificates to restaurants around town, $500 travel money, custom letterman jacket, and other great items. If everyone who Rooter Bob has impacted donated just a dollar, we would have more than enough money for his gift. In some way he has supported us and touched all of our lives. For all that he has done for us, it is time that we give back to him.'Rooter Bob' bleeds Napa blue and gold

Early morning Monday, July 18th, a driver smashed into the side of Cassidy's Bar and Grill, destroying the entire north wall. The establishment is set to be closed for several weeks. 

While insurance will cover most of the physical damages, in the meantime,the employeeswill not be able to rely on the income that pays their bills in the middle of summertime-- the busiesttime of year, and when much of their annual incomes are earned.

Thisfunds raised by this will be given to Cassidys and earmarked for their employees, and any excess to help go to rebuild the structure.

                        Thomas has been on campus for many years after ourfellow students of North Central University gave their lives to protect and provide him with essentials. Thomas has continued since then showing the same love that we showed him by giving his iconic high-fives and being a man of his word by meeting people for coffee or anywhere he promises. This September 24th, 2016, it is Thomas' 60th birthday. I know I've only known Thomas for a year, but after seeing Thomas on campus again this year, something jolted in me to do something for him. I want to get him a new, close to similar, leather jacket. I'm reaching out to you guys because I know a great majority of you guys admire him and I'm not entirely sure what he has or what he accepts. Just wantto surprise him. If more money is raised than the goal, I plan on not only getting him a new jacketbut potentially an entire outfit or two. Share your love! Every donation matters and I will make sure to acknowledge all that contributed within a card I intend on purchasing. Thank you and God bless!P.S. We will be presenting his gift(s) to him on his birthday (September 24th, 2016) at the girls Volleyball game either during the half-time show or after the game. I believe the game is @ Trinity Bible College. The game starts at 7 pm. If anything changes, I will keep you posted.

                        Subject: Fox Company, second Battalion third Marines Reunion Fund Raiser.I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this. As you may know, many service members have a difficult time transitioning back into regular life. It has been over 5 years since all of us have been together in a country half way around the world where no one liked us. It has been years for some, months for others, since we got out of the Marines where everything we did was accepted, valued and normal. Then we were thrown into a life as a civilian, a vet, where people think we are crazy and dangerous. Things that we thought would fade are not and instead of integrating into society, for many of us we feel more and more separated from it. After years of trying to fix our problems either individually or in small groups of two or three, we have decided that we all need to get together and work on our problems. No one cares about us more than the Marines that were there and experienced the same things. Coming together as a unit and tackling these issues head on is the intent of our reunion. We are working on having VA and mental health professionals attend our reunion as well as any other resources we can gather that might help these Marines get better. The problem that we are facing that I hope you can help with is that many of these Marines, the ones that have given up and that really need help, cannot afford to attend the reunion. We have found a location on a ranch in Texas that is not charging us to stay, but air fare is a burden for many of these Marines. We all appreciate your consideration, thoughts and prayers. Anything will help us help ourselves. Thank you, and Semper Fi

                        Aspen, Colorado hosts the 2016 Ski Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and other festivities, scheduled 5th  10th April. I hope to attend, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of my participation in the now-legendary freestyle global competition tourgroup, recently documented in Brian Gilmoress award winning film, Dog Days of Winter ( www.dogdaysofwinter.com). I especially want to bring with me, from Maine, my dad who will turn 84 on the very day of the Induction Ceremony, and my son who will turn 14 in August. I want to share this once-in-a-lifetime adventure with the two people who matter the most in my life -- my son, who is just learning to ski, and my father, who shared his love of skiing with me. I am a single parent home-schooling a child with Down Syndrome, without any financial resources for an adventure of this scale. I need to raise $10,000 to cover the full travel and event participation costs of this trip.  In 1975, I won the first ever national amateur freestyle contest hosted by the United States Ski Association (USSA) and sponsored by Olin Ski Company. In 1976, I was recognized as Rookie of the Year on the Colgate Womens International Freestyle Ski Tour, organized by Professional Freestyle Associates. I garnered sixth place overall, including a first place in aerials, a third in moguls, and numerous other top ten places in moguls and ballet. The following year I placed seventh overall, at year's end. What an adventure for a young girl fresh out of high school! Dad's ardent and unflagging support made all that possible.My dad made sure I had all I needed to enjoy skiing from the age of four, all through my school years of coaching and training, through local and state and regional and national competitions with the amateur USSA. He built a ski camp in remote Maine and kept a family with four children in ski gear and ski passes for decades.This trip affords me the opportunity is to acknowledge and thank my dad for making possible a high point in my life: all my years of skiing adventures as an amateur and a professional competitor. I long to share my joy of skiing with my boy, who is just now learning to ski. For one week this April, for my dad's birthday, I will take my dad and my son for a family adventure. I will luxuriate in my first real vacation in well-over a decade with a whole week's time away from our every-day, very-busy schedules with educational and special needs and wellness service providers. I will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of my adventures with freestylers who are gathering to enjoy the Ski Hall of Fame induction festivities at Aspen.  I dedicate the week to sharing celebration of friends and family and love and laughter. Please support my desire to make this happen. Please give, as soon as you can, so we can register for limited tickets and lodging during a busy week. We have so many reasons for gratitude, and so many reasons to celebrate.Information about the Ski Hall of Fame festivities in April can be found at  http://skihall.com/index.php?_a=document&doc_id=37

I'm writing to ask for your help to raise flight and food money to fly my little sisters out towatch my Masters commencement in May 2016.Iam raising funds to cover the cost of flights and food for my two sisters and my two young nephews to fly from CO to NY. As flight prices increase daily, I would like to raise the funds as soon as possible to avoid changes to my goal and budget.I'm theeldest of my family and since 19, I've raised my two sisters on my own as a single parent. As a sister-turned-guardian, I've worked my tail off to provide the basics, food, shelter, education, and most of all love. Two years ago, I had to temporarily depart from them. Amid the La Plata Mountains in CO, I ventured east to the City of New York to puruse my Masters in Science degree at Columbia University's School of Social Work. It'sbeen an ongoing challenge being away from my sisters yet it's also been a very rewarding experience and now the time has come. My graduation date is set for May 2016. As a first generation college student and first of my family to graduate from an Ivy League University, I hope I've honored my family, my people and aboveof all, I hope I have made my sisters proud. It would mean the world to us if they could see me graduate and walk across the stage.If we are able to raise this money together I would be incredibly thankful and humbled. Please donatewhatever you can and also equally important if not more please share this campaign with your network.Thank you for your contribution and thank you for your time.

                        Rivendell is Frodo's house, where she lives with her partner Jamie and their seven cats! Our former housemate is moving to a retirement center, and is selling the house where we have been renters for 35 years (Frodo), 19 years (Jamie) and 1-14 yrs. (cats). We want to buy our house, and with the help of family we're almost there! We just need to raise a little bit more to make an offer to buy it. Over the years, Rivendell has been the site for community and family gatherings for SisterSpirit, other communities we are active in, and our extended family. It has hosted baby blessings, graduation ceremonies, birthdays, Faerie teas, music jams, barbecues, seasonal celebrations and even parades around the block complete with bagpipes and drums. If our campaign is successful, we envision expanding our offerings for the community, hosting workshops, retreats, weddings, and other celebrations.

Help us save our camps!!Camp Sue Osborn is a special place for special people.Our mission is to provide excellent, everyday camp experiences for individuals with special needs in Lake and Geauga Counties, Ohio. We offer three camp programs: atwo-week day camp, a week-long residence camp, and a three-night Alumni Reunion Camp.   This year we have been hit with funding issues and donations are down.  Our programs are in danger of facing serious cuts to camp days, staffing, programming and camperships! We are hoping to raise at $15,000 to cover our funding deficit this year. The first $5,000 raised will be used to keepour Alumni Camp at three days, and the remaining amounts will go toward camperships and programming for Day and Residence Camps.   Our campers look forward to camp all year! Please help us to give them the awesome experience that they have come to expect from Camp Sue Osborn!  Thank you!

                        All year we have had to fight for everything. We have been on the front line for equality and for 28 years have had a pride parade in birmingham. As of today, the city has informed us (although we applied for our permit in February) that rather than $150 fee as normal we must pay $2600-$3000 to be permitted to have our parade. Help! The same day as our parade is birmingham is an anti marriage equality rally in Montgomery. We need to be bigger and better and continue the fight!

A Festival for Emily and Yvonne,"$11,600 ","$50,000 ",Events," May 18, 2015",111,16,PHILADELPHIA,PA,731000,,2,"

PHILADELPHIA, PA                                





                        Hi everyone,As you may recall, earlier this year, Germanwings Flight 9525 tragically crashed in the French Alps. There were no survivors. Aboard the flight was one of my dearestfriends, Emily Selke, and her mother, Yvonne Selke.Our goal with this GoFundMe is to combine Emily's three passions -- live music, travel, and helping others-- into one meaningful endeavor.Emily was one of the most beautiful human beings and I am incredibly blessed to have known her, let alone be able to call her my friend. She was an incredibly selfless individual who always expressed her caring and love of other through her actions, both big and small.We met our Freshman year in the Music Industry program at Drexel University and bonded almost immediately over our passion for live music.Em had huge dreams and goals, as well as the willpowerand determination to achieve them.When it comes to a tragedy of this severity, it is easy to wallow in sadness and self-pity. However, those are two things that Emily never wanted us to do.During her short time here with us, she constantly encouraged us to ""be gentle with ourselves"" and turn our pity parties into actual parties.Following the crash, my close friend (and Em's college roommate/best friend) Haley and I began brainstorming ways we could keep the memory of Emily and Yvonne alive.On the one year anniversary of the plane crash, we would like to put together a music festival to raise money for Music Industry students who wish to study/intern abroad.In her senior year of college, Emily was fortunate enough to spend the summer in Europe, working with the Edinburgh Fringe Fest and learning about festival management in Barcelona. She intended on continuing to work in international festival management before her life was cut short.Any donation you can make is greatly appreciated. The money will go toward offsetting any overhead costs to get the festival going (deposit fees, booking, promotion, etc.) as well as into the scholarship fund for current and future Drexel University students. We have compiled a list of 20+ of Emily's favorite bands and musicians (both big name acts and smaller local artists), all of whom we plan to reach out to in the near future with hopes of them playing the festival. All proceeds from the festival (to be held in March of 2016) will be put into the Emily & Yvonne Scholarship Fundto help others, like Emily, who have a thirst for travel and a passion for music.Thank you for taking the time to read this and please consider donating to this cause!Hugs, Ashley

                        Sometimes you don't realize that your life is about to change, and sometimes you know all too well. Last week my life changed when I had the honor of meeting Tiffany and her mom, Bernadette as I was the newspaper reporter chosen to cover Tiffany's early high school graduation. Seeing her daughter graduate was Bernadette's biggest wish since learning that she had a terminal form of cancer-- a life changing event they both know all too well. When it became clear that the regular graduation ceremony would come too late for Bernadette, an early one was created and celebrated by family and friends at the Hospice Center where Bernadette was receiving care. Prior to this, Tiffany, an only child raised by Bernadette alone, had been her mom's primary caretaker throughout her four years of high school, the same four years of her mom's illness. You can read my story about them here. My life was changed for the better after meeting such a courageous mother/daughter team whose lives were also about to change, and I am hoping to be able to help Tiffany as she faces the next life changes that come her way. Tiffany was accepted to all six colleges she applied to, and will be going off to school in the fall. As I considered Tiffany and Bernadette's story, I worried for Tiffany, and I kept wondering who would look out for her, who would help care for her, and who would do all those special ""Mom"" things, like sending her care packages when she's in college. I'd like to help Tiffany by giving her a ""giant care package"" and in conjunction with the fundraising that her high school is doing for her, I'm starting this GoFundMe page for her. I've set a goal of $3,000 since within just 24 hours of my story being posted online, it received 3000 hits. I'd love to surpass that amount though!Although it's always been just Tiffany and her mom together, I want Tiffany to know she's not alone as she begins this next bittersweet chapter of her life.

MILWAUKEE, WI                                




Hi, everyone. My name is Der Xiong, and I recently graduated from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee last May. That was one of the most exciting experiences in my life. Graduating was thrilling, but celebrating my accomplishment would be even more exciting. Therefore, Im asking a generosity of financial support, a donation that will go towards my graduation party in August.Before you go ahead, I would like to share you a story. Many people may have known me as beautiful, smart, always the girl with a smile on her face. And that was true, despite all the hardship Ive gone through to make it this far. I also graduated from a Beauty College in Aroura, CO and received my Associates at the Milwaukee Area Technical College. However, I missed out on the celebration on both occasions because I couldn't cover the finances.The heart of the story is that, I was homeless. Nobody knew, except the girl who sat down and ate lunch with other people like everything was normal. Like the girl who stopped to chat with her friends and families like everything was okay. And I was so determined to finish college. I survived a semester living in my car during the cold season, and jumped from places to places whichever provided shelter, even if it was temporary. This time, I wont miss a chance to throw myself a celebration party.Please consider supporting my graduation party financially by making this become a reality with the help of yours. Thank you for all your love and support everyone.I spoke to a couple of people who hosted before, and estimation came between $3-5,000, depending amount of people. Therefore, these are a rough estimation:  - $1,000 to purchase one cow for the blessing ceremony  - $1,000 to rent the place, things, and decoration  - $1,500 for live band and remainder of the food, beverages, and cake  - $ 500 in case came shortPlease share the link and any amount is greatly appreciated.

(English version below)

Cosa vogliamo fare?Gli abitanti di molti stati del Sud-est asiatico si affidano a piccoli motorini per tutte le loro esigenze. Vogliamo andare ad Hanoi, nel nord del Vietnam, e comprare due motorini usati e caricarli con tutti gli oggetti scolastici che riusciremo a comprare con le donazioni fatte da voi. Proprio come fanno i vietnamiti, metteremo tutto sui motorini (sar un carico enorme, circa 100Kg) e lungo i 4000Km che ci aspettano fino a Ho Chi Minh (a Sud) ci fermeremo nelle scuole per incontrare e regalare tutto ci che abbiamo ad almeno 6000 bambini.Sar un viaggio slow, a contatto con la popolazione e in bala degli eventi e degli imprevisti. Durante il viaggio, qualvolta i mezzi avranno bisogno di assistenza, dovremo chiedere aiuto e affidarci alla gente del posto. Non dormiremo mai in alberghi ma aiuteremo le piccole strutture a gestione familiare o dormiremo a casa delle persone incontrate lungo la via.Chi siamo?Gabriele Saluci e Daniel Mazza . 53 anni in due e una passione comune per lavventura e il mondo. Curiamo progetti di viaggio per il web: Gabriele tramite video e Daniel con il suo blog , ed  proprio cos che ci siamo conosciuti. Abbiamo sognato questo viaggio da tantissimo tempo e ora finalmente abbiamo messo insieme tutti i pezzi per partire.Quando partiremo?Da met Luglio il Vietnam sar sotto i nostri piedi e le nostre ruote.La donazione dovr esser fattail prima possibile per permetterci di organizzare e spedire tutto il materiale in tempo.Come utilizzeremo le donazioni?La maggior parte delle donazioni servir ad acquistare oggetti scolastici: abbiamo stimato che con 10.000 potremmo stra-caricare i nostri mezzi con 100Kg tra matite, penne, gomme e quaderni.Una parte minima delle donazioni servir a finanziare le spese del viaggio che non riusciremo a coprire e la parte organizzativa. Investiremo il pi possibile, ma alcune spese non riusciremo comunque ad affrontarle. Stiamo lavorando per cercare sponsor e partner cos da poter aumentare la donazione!Per ogni euro donato:80 centesimi serviranno allacquisto del materiale;8 centesimi  il costo del servizio cheGoFundme offre;2 centesimi l'investimento che indirizzeremo per promuovere l'iniziativa sul web;10 centesimi per le spese di viaggio che non riusciremo a coprire.

A viaggio concluso anche il motorino sar regalato.Perch lo facciamo? - abbiamo gi visto gran parte del mondo, e non vogliamo che questo sia un semplice viaggio. Mettiamo alla prova la potenza dinternet per creare un progetto in cui tutti possano dare una mano e sentirsi partecipi;- unire la passione per quello che si fa con un buon motivo per farlo  la cosa che ci rende pi orgogliosi;- siamo curiosi di capire e raccontare come le persone riescano a lavorare, trasportare la famiglia e vivere con dei mezzi di trasporto cos piccoli e apparentemente inadatti;- il Vietnam  un posto fantastico e vorremmo raccontarlo come noi sappiamo fare.Cosa creeremo:- Materiale fotografico, post giornalieri e diario di viaggio, anche live, sui social e disponibili per tutti;- Documentario completo sulliniziativa che potr vedere in esclusiva chi ha effettuato la donazione, insieme ad altri contenuti privati;- Le donazioni pi generose riceveranno un set di fotografie inedite.Noi siamo Carichi per il Vietnam, ma abbiamo anche bisogno del vostro aiuto per essere ancora pi carichi!XXXXXXXXXXX  English Version XXXXXXXXXX

OUR PROJECT?The people of many South Asian countries rely on small mopedsfor all their needs. We want to go to Hanoi, North Vietnam, buy 2 used scooters and load them with all the school materials that we can buy thanks to your donations.Just like the vietnamese, we will carry everything on scooters (it will be a huge load, hopefully around 100Kg).Along the 4000Km down to Ho Chi Min (in the South) we will stop in schools to give your presents (your donations/what we have/all we have) to at least 6000 kids.It will be a slow journey in touch with the people and at the mercy of events and the unexpected. Whenever the scooters will need assistance we will ask for help and rely on locals. We won't stay in hotels but will help small family run facilities or we will stay in the houses of the people we meet along the way.WHO ARE WE?53 years between the two of us and a common passion for adventure and the world. We both look after travel plans online: via video for Gabriele and blogging for Daniel, and that's how we met. We dreamed of this trip for a long time and now we finally have put together all the pieces and are ready to go.

WHEN? From the middle of July Vietnam will be under our feet and wheels.The donations need to be made as soon as possible so that we will have time to organize everything and ship all the itemsin time.

HOW WILL WE USE THE DONATIONS?Most of the donations will be used to buy school materials: we estimated that with 10k we will be able to overload our scooters with pens, pencils, erasers and notebooks.A small part of it will finance the expenses of the trip that we won't be able to pay for ourselves. We are trying to find sponsors and partners to increase the donations. For every euro donated:80cents will be used to buy the material;8 cents will pay for the gofundme service;2 cents will be used to promote the event online;10 cents will take care of the travel experiences that we can't cover ourselves.At the end of the trip the scooters will be given away as presents as well.WHY ARE WE DOING IT?-We have been travelling all over the world and don't want this to be a simple trip. We want to test the power of internet in creating a project where everyone can help and be a part of.-our biggest pride is to combine the passion of what we do with a good cause;-we want to understand and tell how people can work and carry their families on such a small and apparently unfit conveyance;-Vietnam is an amazing country and we would like to tell you the way we do it.WHAT WE ARE GOINT TO CREATE?-photos, daily post and travelogue on social medias;- full documentary exclusive for donors including private contents;-biggest donors will receive a set of unpublished pictures.We are ready for vietnam but we can't do it without your help!

Strength and Honor Mentoring and Tutoring(SAH) was started by an educator named Albert Harrold who wanted to make a change in struggling communities. Albert is a husband and father of four. He has always had a passion for underprivileged youth. Being that Albert is an educator he is able to see first hand what our youth are dealing with in day to day life. Watching young people go down the wrong path and ending up in prison or even dead really impacted his decision to begin this program. He wanted to touch on core values that are important in helping children become effective adults, but most importantly boys become men. Education is the key! Offering tutoring services allows children to work one on one with a highly skilled individual to better themselves in their area difficulty. Mentoring services gives children and young adults the opportunity to maximize their chance at becoming the best they can be by being strong, confident, honorable adults. Summer camp is a bonus! SAH summer camp is the place to be in the summer. We offer a summer camp program like no other. At SAH summer camp we do community service each week, arts and crafts, camping retreats, weekly field trips, mentoring sessions and so much more. SAH summer camp is help during the months of June and July. We have consistently served between 30-40 campers each week. Over 98% of our campers attend a school that is considered high risk. SAH needs you to help in order to continue giving these young menan opportunity for hope. We personally thank you for the impact that you willhave on our boys. www.mysah.org

PORTLAND, ME                                





                        Yoga is Medicine. At Maine Hatha Yoga we continuously witness those in our community heal and overcome many challenges- whether it be physical, mental, emotional or spiritual. These last few years there has been a significant increase of people from the addiction recovery community coming to our studio and we see them find freedom through a committed practice. Opiate addiction is hitting record numbers in Maine and elsewhere. It seems like government institutions are more interested in locking addicts in cages rather than helping them heal. Our governor is shutting down addiction recovery clinics and building prisons. An addict is someone who is sick and suffering . We need to unite in support of our loved ones. So many people are affected but there is a lack of understanding. We are breaking the silence with our first annual Yoga, Mindfulness For Addiction Recovery Conference in Portland, Maine. On October 9th at the Portland Public Library we have some AMAZING guest speakers lined up including Chris Grosso and Joe Putignano, more about them in some updates. We are also presenting PUREAction to launch the Portland chapter of One Posture At A Time, bringing yoga to addicts residing in long-term or residential programs in the area.

I reside in the Fayetteville/Ft. Bragg NC area and came to know some of the Special Forces team members who were the first response team into Afghanistan after 9/11 about three years ago. In that time, I have been in awe of their story of courage, bravery and dedication to their country in the mission that they carried out. The courageous actions and unique experience of ODA-595 and these SF veterans were the inspiration for a Horse Soldier monument designed by equestrian sculptor Douwe Blumberg in 2002. Historians now credit Task Force Dagger and these few Special Forces teams and operators because of their exceptional deeds as allowing America to be seen by the Afghan people as liberators, a living example of the Special Forces motto, De Oppresso Liber meaning to liberate the oppressed. They would later be identified by President Bush as the Horse Soldiers which inspired a book by Doug Stanton as well as other publications including ""The Last Warlord"" by Brian Glynn Williams.We need your support to help these original Special Forces team members who bravely fought in Afghanistan & their family travel to NYC to attend the dedication ceremony of the monument on Sept 13th.The donations received will be used to off-set transportation and lodging expenses andI will be responsible fordispersingthose funds from the GoFundMe directly to the team members. This is important so please take a minute to make a contribution on the link, or email me about donating air miles or hotel points. We need as many contributions as possible within the next two weeks and need your help to ensure that we can support as many team members and their families as possible to attend the dedication. Please also share this post and help get the word out for these brave heroes.Thank-you!

Greetings my Brothers and Sisters,
My fondest memories of Jamaica, this beautiful land of wood and water are filled with sunshine, food, love, and laughter. My affection for Jamaica started when my family would send me there to spend summer vacations with my extended family in a little fishermans village called Whitehouse. The encounters there presented adventure and kinships that are still present in my life today. I knew then, as a teenager, that someday I would return to Jamaica to do something that would make a difference in the lives of others. The Library of Hope is that something. It is an educational resource center that offers a space for educators and emerging educators to participate in educational workshops that cultivate a sense of cultural enrichment via the arts and technology. Educators will gain a deeper understanding of culturally responsive pedagogy as strategies for student-centric teaching and learning are shared for utilization in their future classroom practices. According to Hanley and Norblit (2009), culturally responsive pedagogy is about using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters more relevant and effective for them. It teaches to and through the strengths of these students (p. 28). The Library of Hope plans to develop an educational collective in Montego Bay as means to birth a cultural excursion that explores current issues about human rights, sustainability, social justice, health and wellness. As synergistic relationships with each other are nurtured an authentic support system will emerge as a collaborative learning community with opportunities that go beyond the classroom.As part of the vision, the Library of Hope offers teachers a chance to borrow books for their classrooms, assistance with lesson plan development, threaded discussions, PowerPoint presentation development, and educational giveaways to name a few. The Library of Hope also provides community outreach initiatives for schools, summer camps and educational groups by offering Kemetic yoga classes, urban theatre, sustainable creative art workshops, book read-a-thons, poetry contests, scholarships, giveaways, and much more. In an educational and entertaining way, our cultural enrichment programs build self-esteem by highlighting the importance of identifying with positive character traits. With integrity and genuineness the Library of Hope strives to uphold a vision to build academic success and educational equity for disenfranchised students in the 21st century and beyond by empowering teachers with the tools to motivate their students to learn. Located about 20 minutes away from the Montego Bay airport, the Library of Hope is situated in the lush hills of Lethe, Jamaica and is ready to empower and serve. We hope that you will feel our cause to empower and serve by donating to the Library of Hope. Currently, we are seeking monetary donations and/or educational supplies:* USB drives* Laptops or Desktop computers* Yoga mats (18 were gifted by an anonymous donor)* Yoga bricks (8 were gifted by an anonymous donor)* Crayons new, old, or broken & Markers* Books by Black authors that cater to Black themed concepts* Spiritual and Sci Fi books* Board games* Magazines* Comic books * Dictionaries, Thesaurus, Encyclopedias* Pencils and Pens* Puzzles, jacks, deck of cards* Printer(s)* Paper (construction, newspapers, computer, loose-leaf, tissue)* Glue (sticks and liquid white)* Fabric scraps, ribbons, buttons, embellishments* Light bulbs, ceiling fans* Scissors, staplers, paper clips, staples, rulers, tape measure,  rubber bands* etc.There are several levels of donation, so please read carefully as each level offers a perk for your dollars, energy, effort, and time.

Help us bring glamping to our Girl Scouts!At Girl Scouts of North East Ohio, camp is our home away from home, which is why were excited about the opportunity to build a yurt! A new outdoor trend, a yurt is a form of glamour campinghaving all the amenities of home while being immersed right in the middle of nature.Yurts are made from sustainable and recyclable materials and are one of the most eco-friendly ways to connect with the outdoors. While most structures have a permanent foundation, yurts are built on a platform, leaving minimal impact on the surrounding environment. Just like the Girl Scout way!The yurt at our camp will be available for use year-round and will have all the amenities of a cabin: a kitchen, indoor bathrooms, heat for the winter, and an enclosed patio. With enough bunks to sleep 16, its the perfect way to glamp at Girl Scout camp.With your support, construction for the new yurt will begin in the fall at Camp Timberlane. That means reservations will be available to troops for spring of 2016!We need our Girl Scout sisters and friends to help us reach our goal of $24,000 to purchase the yurt kit by September 15. Please contribute to make this unique opportunity possible for our girls. We need all of our members and their families to help us get there! To get the greatest reach, we need you to also share our GoFundMe link and our social media posts on Facebook and other social media sites.Every gift of every size matters--even a gift of $1 helps! Any funds we raise over our goal will help pay for the construction of the yurt.Thank you for helping us bring glamping to our girls in northeast Ohio!Note: All rewards are cumulative. Meaning a $250 donation will get you two ticketsto the Donor Experience Day, as well as the ""I Helped Build the Yurt"" patch and 10 chances to pick the troop with the first reservation.All gifts are fully tax-deductible, with the exception of the fair market value of the Donor Experience Day for donors of $250 or more who choose to redeem this reward. (Fair market value for two participants: $70.) All minors must be accompanied by an adult chaperone. To use the high ropes or zip lines, participants must weigh between 55-300 pounds and be in 6th grade or above. All other Donor Experience Day activities can be enjoyed by participants of all weights and ages. Event will be held rain or shine!

                        Darkhorse Lodge Veterans Retreat~Yes... we have a very lofty goal! With over 2.3 million American veterans of the Iraq & Afghanistan wars, we have a large group of men and women that our nation is blessed to call ""Our Heroes""! Many of these heroes suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, and otherphysical wounds. Let's do what we can to get this combat veteran's retreat up and running as soon as we can. It can offersome tranquility for mental & physical healing. We can show them that they, indeed, are NOT forgotten heroes! GOD BLESS THEM ALL!!!Darkhorse Lodge is a non-profit organization with 501(c)(3) recognition.Donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law (see your tax advisor formore information).Oncethe fundraising goal has been met, construction phase will begin. When completed, this will be a retreat for combat veterans of all branches to come to relax, fish on Kentucky Lake, and enjoy area activities. It will allow our veterans time tocommunicate with others who have walked in their boots and hopefully find some peace and healing. There will be no charge to the veteran.Once completed, there will be 5 guest cabinswith 5 rooms each named in honor of the 25 men lost from the Marine Corps 3/5, Darkhorse unit during the 2010-2011 deployment. Whenthe Catherwood's19 year old son, LCpl Alec E Catherwood, was killed in action during that deploymenton October 14, 2010, it felt as if the world had ended for them. After realizing thatthey had no choice but to go on,Gretchen stayed up nights wondering whatshe could do for those who did come home. Onceshe had the basics down,her very smart husband, Kirk,added some much needed improvements to the plan. The Catherwoods found a beautiful piece of land and moved to their new home in Paris, TN.This was the first stepto turn their dream of helping returning combat veterans into a reality.Findinga new purpose in life has giventhe Catherwoodsa reason to get up each morning and face the challenges ahead. We are going to need A LOT offunding to get this built.Five guest cabins, a staff cabin, a shower house and a dining facility (named for US Army National Guard, Specialist Tim Bowman, who committed suicide on Thanksgiving Day, 2005 after returning home from Iraq).The Darkhorse Lodgeemployees will be combat veterans as well, including those who will take the participants fishing at one of the most beautiful spots in the south (oh yeah, we'll need boats and gear donated as well). Our cabins will be handicapped accessible to accommodate as many of these heroes as possible. We will also need continued support for the long haul, so please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.You can find out more information about the Darkhorse Lodge on the Facebook page ""Darkhorse Lodge"" and on the website  www.darkhorselodge.org.Every donation, big or small, will help build this dream! Thank you for taking the time to read about the Darkhorse Lodge. Have a blessed day :)

Silkies Hike- Austin,"$4,333 ","$6,300 ",Events," August 12, 2015",41,13,AUSTIN,TX,588000,,,"

AUSTIN, TX                                




This campaign was very successful, and we are beyond grateful for everyone's support, but we still ended up paying $2500 out of pocket for this incredible event.

We kindly ask that everyone who participated in the hike please donate just $5.

If EVERYONE donates $5, we'll have enough money to finish paying for the police escort that enabled us to hike safely throughout the city of Austin for over 14 miles.

This GoFundMe is a great tool, however they take 6% of YOUR donations right off the top.

Irreverent Warriors has started using another donation platform called CommitChange, which takesZERO percent of your donation. This is this it!

This is our new donation processor! https://commitchange.com/ca/san-diego/irreverent-warriors

Please make your donations to our new platform so that we don't lose 6% to GoFundMe.

We are a registered 501c3 non-profit, and therefore your donations are tax deductible. You will recieve a receipt for your donations.Tax ID Number-47-4789126

This campaign is to help pay for some of the costs associated with the execution of the Irreverent warriors- Austin Silkies Hike- 22 km with 22kg for the 22 veterans each day who take their own lives,taking place on Sept 26th, 2015.These cost are things like City Permits, Police escorts (we are required to have and pay half of the officers wage), baracades that may be required by the city, water, safety vehicle (rental or use), other safety related items, and snacks along the way.Of course we are striving to have these items donated if possible, and anyremaining funds will go towards plane tickets for combat veterans to come out to one of the hikes of their choosing, anywhere in the US, or will go to the main organization we support  http://irreverentwarriors.comThe Silkies Hike Movement was started by Donny O'Malley (Danny Maher) and Ryan Loya in San Diego, CA.We hike because it makes us feel nostalgic, because the pain and suffering brings out the best of our personalities, and because shared misery brings us closer together.22 pounds is too light, and not enough pain.22 kg (48 pounds) is just right.22 miles is too long for most, and not enough people can do it.22 km is just right.We wear silkies because they make us laugh. Humor is how wedeal with pain, suffering, and tragedy, so everything we do as a group should be humorous and fun in nature. Laughter in the midst of suffering istherapeutic for us.We stop at bars because bars have been a part of military culture since day one.When you put all these incredients together, you have a large, walking, group therapy session.Veterans have to be there for each other. We have to be remindedthat we understand each other, we love each other, and are always there to support each other.Just by reading this you are now aware of the 22 veterans who kill themselves everyday, so this hike is about more than awareness, it is one form of therapy for our nations veterans.Every single veteran who shows up is now less likely to kill themselves, and that's what were trying to do. We're trying to stop just ONE person from killing themselves. If we can do that, we've succeeded.These hikes support ALL veterans, combat or not, and if you talk to any of the non-combat veterans who have attended, they will tell you that they had the time of their lives.To be clear, outside of this Austin events costs (as listed above) this campaign funding will go to support Donny and his missionto, ""pay for plane tickets for combat veterans, specifically mostly combat wounded guys in my network of combat wounded friends. I myself am not combat wounded, but MANY of my friends are. If I raise enough money, I can extend plane tickets out to anyone who you all recommend me to.It's not too much to say that this event can literally save someones life, so please help me bring these boys to one of these events, and hopefully there will be fewer suicides this year.""This is something I plan to get behind 100% as it falls close to my heart. This is a true and just cause that can really help our vets.We in Arizona would like to thank Donny O'Malley for his hard work and passion to get this movement soaring as it already is!!!!And Thank you all for your continued support

If you'd like us to pack any of these requested supplies in our car as a gift to the beautiful souls who are standing up to protect sacred ground, please contribute whatever you can.We'd love tobring all of you with us in some way, and we hopeto bring stories back that can inspire all of us to dare great things in service of our land, water and one another.UPDATE: We've arrived now, supplies in hand. Any additional contributions to this GoFundMe will help provide additional supplies to meet emerging needs here in North Dakota. It's cold here, and getting colder, so our first purchase will be an additional wood stove.Photo by Dallas Goldtooth .PS: If you would prefer, you may also make a cash PayPal transfer.

                        Due to a tragic event, our dear friend Tasha Hanson has passed away. She was an incredible person who brought smiles to many faces. Her two children are now with her family. We, the Class of 2010, are setting up this fundraiser to aid in raising the children as well as help provide for the funeral services. Any donation is tremendously appreciated. Any funds raised will be donated directly to Tasha's family.

WEST CHICAGO, IL                                





                        This is painful to say and even more embarrassing to ask. But ask I must, so here it is: My family is in need of assistance. My brother Shane, 16, has lost a severe amount of weight and has spent much of the last twelve weeks in the hospital as doctors try to figure out the cause of the weight loss, dangerously low blood pressure and severe nerve pain. In the last year, our dad and grandma (moms side) have passed away, so it has been a very tough time for our family, especially Shane, outside of his own health issues. With the hospital bills starting to roll in, my mom has been with Shane the entire time of his hospital stay and has not been able to work for a majority of the last twelve weeks, while also having to juggle the loss of her husband and mom. Without my dads insurance, which was job provided, the financial responsibilities for my family are so significant that staying in the only house Shane has ever known, may not be possible. Im biased, naturally, but Shane is a much better person at 16 than I could have dreamed of being. He is grounded, willing to help anyone in need and has maintained a positive attitude amid all the adversity he has faced this past year. As a family, we are doing everything we can to help Shane get the care he needs and discover the underlying cause of his issues. However, without my dad around anymore, the fiscal aspect of this is daunting. I always think of Shane, not as the teenager that struggles to walk right now, but as the athlete that enjoys football, basketball, track and the work that comes with improving at those. Any help you could provide my brother and my family would be much appreciated.-Rick Camp

Hey there! My name is Brittany Mothershead. I am wife to Chad and Mama to our 3 girls, Joeli (angel), Brelan, and Mileigh. I have congenital cyclic neutropenia and so does 2 of our girls. Joeli went to be with Jesus on Jan. 18, 2007 at the age of 3 www.joelissong.blogspot.com. Brelan is healthy. Mileigh is also neutropenic. Often the National Neutropenia Network puts on a family conference in the summer for parents and patients to meet with each other as well as world experts in neutropenia. These forms of neutropenia are very rare. Mileigh has never met another child like her so we are planning a trip this summer so she and Brelan can attend the camp they have for children and siblings affected by neutropenia. We are in South Alabama and will be driving to Michigan to attend. As you can imagine, our medical bills are often overwhelming and seem to never end. We are doing local fundraisers to assist with our trip but figured maybe this could be bigger. It's so important to me for her to find friends like her and for Brelan to find other siblings like her. Brelan is a great big sister and is always near to be supportive to Mileigh. 
 I am neutropenic as well so I stay home with our girls. Chad does so good making sure our needs are met. Brelan was very young when Joeli left this Earth and Mileigh came along shortly after. Although Mileigh was never able to meet Joeli she has an incredible connection with her. I long for the day that I'm able to hold all of my girls together...for now, we fight for Joeli by fighting for Mileigh and for children like her. Please pray for our family. Pray for strength when we are low and peace in the storms and for finances to be enough. He is ABLE! Thank you so much for taking the time to hear our story. Please consider donating and more importantly please keep praying. He hears. Be Blessed!

Sp. Needs' Christmas in July 2016,"$2,830 ","$2,700 ",Events," March 27, 2016",56,6,LEBANON,TN,570000,1,27,"






                            Debbie Wooden
                            
                            
                                                           
LEBANON, TN                                




My name is Debbie Wooden, and I am a proud mom of 2 adult children, one of whom has multi-disabilities. Daniel is now 26 years old. After he aged out of high school, I was approached by another mom of special needs' adults. We realized there were not many programs geared toward special needs' adults. Everything seemed to end once they aged out of school. She began a day program called Joy Center. We opened in July 2012 with ten students, who we call VIPs because we know they are Very Important People. As Joy Center's one year anniversary rolled around, I felt led to do something special for our VIPs. I decided on a Christmas in July Party, complete with Bible lesson, games, relays, crafts, and of course, gifts that were donated by local businesses and individuals.  The director and I also challenged each other to a relay with the loser getting a pie in the face. For some reason, it always seems to be a tie, with both of us getting pied.By 2014, our VIP numbers had grown considerably, but through private donations, we managed to continue our tradition of our Christmas in July Party.  As I began to plan for Christmas in July 2015, with even more new VIPs, I realized our once small group party had outgrown my 1500 sq. ft. home.  WHAT A BLESSING. ...Our 2015 party had grown so much that we rented a venue for that year. With God's blessing us, we had our biggest ever Christmas in July Party, managing to get gifts for not only our 21 VIPs, but a few special needs' guests, as well. Our students even enjoyed a talent show and a beauty pagaent,complete with hair stylists, manicurists, and makeup assistants. (We had to make good use of the stage, now didn't we?)The funds raised from this account will be used to purchase gifts, averaging $100 per VIP, maxing out at 25 gift recipients. Anything over that amount will be used to purchase food items, pagaent necessities, craft or game needs, or it could possibly opening it up to including another special needs' guests or two. I am hoping to have the funds by June 1st to ensure enough time to buy all gifts and have each individually wrapped by our party date of July 7,2016.Seeing these kids smile and making them happy means the world to me. Some of our VIPs can't walk, talk, or see. They have been excluded by so many because of their disabilities, that I would like to continue to show them how special they are by including them specificially......by having the best Christmas in July Party...EVER. I would be so thankful for each donation, no matter how small.  Remember the story of the Widow's Mite?  It's not about how much you give, but doing so with a loving heart. Thank each of you for taking the time to read my story. God Bless each of you.

Sponsored Silence ,,,Events," April 19, 2014",69,29,Shirley West Ward,ENG,559000,,2,"

                        ""It's good to talk"".I remember this as the slogan for the BT adverts when I was growing up and I seem to have taken it literally - ha!Anyway in order to stop your ears from bleeding and in turn doing a little bit for charity, I have decided to do a sponsored silence for 48 hours. Yes a WHOLE TWO days of no communication - this actually means no talking, no texting, no whatsapp, no emails, no twitter, facebook, instagram, no secret notes and not even any talking to Dizzy and I'll up the stakes even further and no talking to myself either! I must be totally crazy or really passionate about this cause - I like to think its more of the latter and less of the former!My chosen charity is 'Socks and Chocs'. 'Socks and Chocs' is a charity founded by Ian Northcott. Ian is a Police Officer in the West Midlands who I met when I donated some cupcakes to a cake sale that him and his students organised as part of the Princes Trust programme. ""Socks and Chocs' is not a complicated approach and it doesn't have to be because it works "" accommodation is a stabilising factor for many people and although there is no magic wand to provide everyone with stable homes, ""Socks and Chocs' makes a homeless person's situation ever so slightly better. When I spoke to Ian and he told me about his charity, it made me appreciate how fortunate I am and it made me want to do something - anything to help.So a sponsored silence is it!This is due to start at 9am on Saturday 17th May 2014 and finish at 9am on Monday 19th May 2014.So the rules are:NO talkingNO writingNO text messages/iMessages/whatsappNO emailsNO twitter/facebook/instagram*The only exception is any business calls or emails related to cakes which I have a seperate number and email address for in any event.**And in the event of an emergency, I would ask that you call Hassan or my house phone please.If there are any breaches, I will contribute one pair of socks per breach.My target is 250 and with this, we will be able to buy 750 pairs of socks!!! In 2013, Socks and Chocs, collected and distributed 8479 pairs of socks and the target for 2014 is to collect 10,000 pairs of socks and I want to contribute towards reaching and exceeding this target.As some of you are not Birmingham/Solihull based, I am happy for you to send me the money and I will buy the socks on your behalf. You can contribute socks, chocolates, sleeping bags and even hats and gloves and for those living locally, I would be willing to collect any items offered.Start pledging people, it might be the only time you get some peace and quiet!!

                        That's right folks we're headed back to the largest libertarian festival in the country The Porcupine Freedom Festival in Lancaster New Hampshire, and we're bringing Ramadan with us.This year promises to be our biggest and best year yet. Porcfest itself is joining in the festivities, and Ramadan@Porcfestis becoming a central part of the festival itself.Along with our normal iftar program, of offering thousands of free iftar meals to both the muslims in attendance, and the non muslim festival goers, every night of the week. We'll also be locally sourcing 2 goats, which will be slaughtered, with one being fed to festival goers, and the other prepared, and taken by muslim and non muslim volunteers, to be handed out at the local homeless shelter.Time is of the essense, and the faster we raise all the money needed, the sooner all fees can be paid, and we can reserve a prime spot for handing out iftar this year.The Prophet(saws) is reported to have stated that the best action in Islam is to feed the people, and great those whom you know and do not, with greetings of peace.Please assist us in putting this sunnah into action, and in the process winning more supporters, defenders, and allies for the Muslim community here in the US.

MILLION GIMP MARCHJobs. Equality. Economic Justice.Aint Too Proud To Beg!Hello and congratulations! You've found our GoFundMe page! Thanks for stopping by. As people with disabilities living in America, we are ALWAYS facing barriers, being abused & ignored. People treat us horrible and call us retarded, welfare scum or an uneducated waste of space and we should be shot or blown up. We are the LARGEST minority group in America. Disabilities strike us all, it DOESNT discriminate. So many people with disabilities (visible & invisible) are highly educated and would love the opportunity to work. Yes, the unemployment rate has decreased but for people with disabilities it has increased. While in Washington, we are going to rally and take our list of demands to the White House. We feel this March will be an unforgettable and incomparable journey we must take.We're MGERF and we're a national organization. In our two year career, we've had the pleasure of starting new chapters in some great states. We're talking states like Colorado (Super Bowl Champs), Texas, Arizona, Utah and Ohio (Bowl winners- Ohio State Buckeyes). But now we've been presented with an opportunity unlike any other opportunity we've ever had: A chance to march on Washington, DC! Our March will be very similar to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jrs iconic March on Washington.We will roll/walk from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, where we'll have a rally featuring speakers and performers. The Marchitself isabout a mileand we will be seen carrying banners, posters and handing out informational flyers. That's where YOU come in. We need help getting there. Your donation will go toward helping us pay for airfare, hotel rooms in one of the most expensive places in the country (Washington, D.C.), as well as transportation while we're there. Its hard to put a value on the experience of the march, but it is easy to identify a price. Historically, the cost of providing program materials, t-shirts, transportation, accessibility in the park, speakers & entertainment and other logistics to have a HISTORICAL march amounts to $275,000 and it is the goal of MGERF/MGM to raise all of those funds. It is for that reason that we earnestly ask you to consider sponsoring the event. Please help us continue to the work of making MGM a safe and unforgettable march. Thanks so much for taking a second to check out Million Gimp March and our campaign. We sincerely appreciate you and we hope you'll consider donating to help us get to the 2016 Million Gimp March! And hey, while you're at it, share our campaign with your friends! Every dollar helps!For more information about the Million Gimp March and MGERF, visit  http://www.milliongimpmarch.com

SAINT LOUIS, MO                                





                        My name is Natalie Vowell. I've been fighting the establishment since 2013, advocating in Jefferson City for environmental issues and cannabis reform and connecting regular citizens to their legislators. I first challenged a corrupt dynasty incumbent for a State Representative seat in 2014. When Secretary of State Jason Kander abused the power of his office to remove me from the ballot to do a favor for my opponent, the ACLUand the Freedom Center of Missouritook my case to keep my name on the ballot.I don't raise funds; I just work hard. I'm the executive director of Project Raise The Roof, an organization I founded to fight St. Louis City's abuse of our seniors and veterans and perpetuation of cyclical poverty among African American families. My annual salary is $0. I am literally a full-time volunteer.In 2015, I came within 3% of winning a seat on the St. Louis City School Board with a campaign budget of $30, meanwhile an opponent spent $38,000.  I used biodegradable wheatpaste posters, recycled yard signsfrom other candidates' past campaigns, and knocked on doors every day.When Bernie announced his candidacy, I immediately looked for other supporters in the region. I organized the first phone bank in St. Louis City, on Cherokee Street (almost one year before the campaign office was opened there). At St. Louis Pride,I recruited Bernie volunteers from the line at the ""Ready For Hillary"" Booth. I took a Trump pinata to the Hispanic Festival and, wearing a homemade Bernie cocktail dress, spoke a little Spanish to reach out to minority voters. I helped organize the first volunteer recruitment picnic. I helped get 6 venues on board to host over 2,000 people for the first Democratic Debate. As the keynote speaker for a Bernie fundraiser/volunteer concert, I rallied fellow Sanders supporters tonot only jointhe revolution but tobecome the revolution by running for state and municipal offices. Over a dozen Bernie supporters are on the August 2016 ballot!In February, I begansaving money for airfare and reaching out to friends in Philadelphia who could house our national delegates, including myself, in the event I were to earn such an honor. On April 28, I was elected as a delegate for MO CD1, and bought my plane ticket last week.But as of today,our delegates are now officially required to stay at the Party's assigned hotel for the duration of the convention...and it will cost over $600 per night.As I said, I'm not a fundraiser; I'm a hard worker.  But the cost of DNC accommodations are an obstacle that hard work alone can't overcome. A monetary barrier to entry in a pay-to-play political game where the establishment writes the rules. I hope you'll consider making a donation to get me to the DNC. Because I will continue to fightfor Bernie's principles until the final gavel adjourns the convention.

Louis Zamperini's Unbroken Promise,"$1,500 ","$10,000 ",Events," April 8, 2015",38,17,LOS ANGELES,CA,536000,,4,"






                            Clay Zamperini
                                                            for VICTORY BOYS CAMP INC

LOS ANGELES, CA                                





                        My name is Clay Zamperini. I'm the only grandson of Louis Zamperini , hero of the major motion picture, Unbroken , directed by Angelina Jolie. While many people know the story of my grandfather's athletic prowess in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, or his heroics in World War II, his life's mission didn't begin until he came home from the war.In 1956, Louis founded Victory Boys Camp , a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that took juvenile delinquents into the California wilderness to teach them the value of self-respect, tenacity, perseverance, survival, forgiveness, and humility. For decades he was changing the lives of young people by sharing his unbelievable story, and showing them that they had the power within themselves to accomplish anything if they only believed that they could.Louis Zamperini with the original group of ""Victory Boys""My grandfather passed away in 2014 , at the age of 97. The whole of his existence was still centered on helping young people get their lives on track, even on his deathbed. It is my dream to continue the work that he started, using the great outdoors as a classroom to teach at-risk young people that they are valuable members of society.To do this, I have partnered with Summit Adventure , whohas been using adventure programming in the wilderness and experiential education as tools for challenge and growth since 1973. We have set up a program wherein at-risk young people will be taken on an adventure through the Sierra Nevada in California, spending several days camping, hiking, rock climbing, and rappelling as they are led by our guides and volunteers. All the while, they are being listened to, cared for, and taught how to life through ourcore tenets, as exemplified in the bookUnbroken, by Laura Hillenbrand:ForgivenessChallengeSurvivalHopePreparednessPositivityContentmentHumilityMy goal is to build self-respect in young people by giving them a sense of accomplishment and encouraging a life of service, so that they may go on to help others as we are helping them.It is my belief that these lessons and exposure to the great outdoors are vital to young people, whether their families can provide these to them or not. I want to raise money here so that these young people can have these experiences at no cost to themselves, or to their families. Every dollar that is donated here will be put towards making this dream a reality, covering the costs of food, transportation, professional guides, and more.Fundraising Milestones: $10,000 Raised - Send 10 young people to camp $20,000 Raised - Send20 young people to camp $30,000 Raised - Send 30 young people to camp $40,000 Raised - Send 40 young people to camp, completely funding our first year program goal!Find out more information about this program at www.louiszamperinifoundation.orgPlease, if nothing else, share this campaign with your loved ones on social media.Thank you for your support!

""Clean water is important because it will help kids grow and learn and stay alive. In my heart I feel that I should help peoplebecause they're just like me - they should be able to have the freedom to learn and grow."" ~ Olivia, 6 yrs oldOlivia is a kind andsensitive1st grader in Raleigh, NC. She came home from school recently, after learning about the lack of clean water in some regions,and quietly informed us that, forher birthday,she would like people to help her raise moneyto drill a well. Rather than recieve gifts for herself, she wants to share the gift of clean water with others! We are very proud of her spirit and passion to help others and put their basic needs above her own desire for new toys/gifts.After careful research, we are very excited to be partnering with Carol and Brian of Love One Another Project. We are working with them specifically to drill a borehole in the village of Busega, Kampala in Uganda. Families in this community have no access to clean water and instead walk about amile to fill buckets with stagnant, diseased water - the only thing available to them. This water is used for drinking, cooking, laundry, dishes, livestock,brick making,bathing,and so much more! Boreholes are deeper than wells and, as a result, never run dry. Olivia's birthday wish will ensure that an entire village has access to clean drinking water for generations to come!This is Pastor Samuel, his wife Sarah, and 2 of their children. They will be overseeing the installation of the borehole in their community!We invite you to join in making this simple, innocent, and loving birthday wish come true. Any amount you can provide will be greatly appreciated! If you are not in a position to donate, please share this link with your friends and family, via social media, email, etc to help us spread the word. We will surprise Olivia on her birthday (June 30) with our fundraising total reveal!All proceeds from this fundraiser will go directly to Love One Another Project for the expressed purpose of drilling this borehole in Busega. If you prefer, you can donate directly on Love One Another's website. Please specify that your gift is in honor of Olivia and is to be used toward the Busega borehole.To read more about Love One Another Project and their commitment to clean water, please visit the clean watersubpage of their website.Carol & Brian's last borehole project:such amazing work!

The founder of Patriotic PinUps is a military wife to a soldier currently overseas, hence why afundraiser lIke the Independence Fund has a special place in ourhearts. We have teamed up with The Adore Girls PinUps, a professional photography team,in Nashville, TN as well as Tatyana , a retro-vintage clothing national boutique chain, we are putting together a 2016 calendar showcasing each branch of the military. Ourvision has a retro feel to it showcasing models in uniforms across bases throughout the nation. Our goal is to raise over $35,000 for the Independence Fund with our classy pin up calendar by distributing them at our sponsors retail spaces, military exchanges, and maybe even in all the Independence Fund events across the country. The Independence Fund is a non-profit organization that challenges themselves and the citizens of our great nation toprovide a place and a way where injured Veterans can find their independence again.This organization creates mobile trackdevices that give limbless veterans the ability to be out in nature, whether it be hunting with buddies, playing on the beach with their children, or simplytaking their dog for a walk. These things that most people take for granted aresomething that injured veterans long for, and the INDY Fund helps them retain that once more. While theIndy Fund gives limbless veterans their independence back, which is priceless, these mobile devices carry a heafty price tag . The more we can cover of the production cost (printing services, travel, shipping costs) with your donations the more we can give back to those who have given so much for our freedom already. We truly believe that with your sponsorship we could meet our donation goal and help even more veterans regain their independence, while promoting national awareness for this great organization. And don't think that those calendars will go to waste if we can't sale all 800 we are hoping to be able to produce. All remaining unsold calendars will be boxed up and sent overseas to deployed soldiers in care packages for the 2015 holidays. What a great little extra piece of America to have hanging in their tent, rack, or barracks!  We hope that you have as much passion for our military men and women as we do and can find it in your hearts (and budgets) to donate to this worthy fundraising event. We trust thatyouwill be amuch valued ally in this fight for our veterans independence and Hope that together, we can Be a Hero, for a Hero today.

                        My name is Cory J Douglas, I am the elected Bernie Sander's delegate from the 15th Illinois Congerssional District. The hotel room alone will cost me over $500 a night. The plane ticket to Philadelphia cost me nearly $350. In short it is nowhere near cheap. Won't you please help me to get there?On October 28, 2009 I suffered a bleeding stroke. Now mind you, at this point I could still walk and talk, albeit rather labored. Three days after suffering this hemmorraghic stroke, the Drs came and told me they had finally figured out what was wrong with me-- they gave me a diagnosis of suffering with Multiple Sclerosis.Three days post MS diagnosis I woke up and was unable to walk nor talk. I have came a long way since then. I am now able to not only walk and talk, but have gone back to work.

ATHENS, OH                                




My name is Hilarie Burhans. My husband Mark and I and our son Ry live in Athens, Ohio, just 37 miles from the WV border. We and other old-time musicians from all over the US love West Virginia, the home of one our favorite festivals: Clifftop, aka the Appalachian Stringband Festival.But just 14 miles away from Camp Washington Carver is the town ofRainelle, one of the hardest-hit by the devastating floods WV experienced last weekend. 

I don't have a lot of money myself to donate, but together we are powerful, I'm sure, and enough folks know and respect me and my husband Mark that I know you'll trust us to get the money raised to the right hands. We've wanted to keep the money in the hard-hit area near Clifftop, so we've chosen the Greenbrier County Emergency Shelterto receive thefunds raised through this campaign. The folksat the local radio station, 103.1 The Bear - Greenbrier told me that this organization is ""very deserving and has assisted many in our communities who have lost their homes."" The parent organization is called Neighbors Loving Neighbors, and is an interfaith organization based within the Rhema Christian Center. It was also recommended in a press release from The Greenbrier. The person I've spoken to there has told me that the money will be used for direct cash assistance for flood victims.We hope you'll be moved to give at least a little to these folks who have lost so much. Thank you in advance for your generous donation!

                        Rose of Hope Foundation was founded in October 2008. We began with a simple goal to better the community and help youth develop competencies for self-improvement and motivation to achieve a higher education even in the face of adversity. Within the Rose of Hope Foundation are many projects, initiatives and programs that involve mentorship and workshops that encourage youth to make better decisions.The Rose of Hope Summer Camp is one of annual events. It serves as alternative summer programming for marginalized youth in the city of Indianapolis. We are raising money to ensure that we have the needed resources to provide a fun, educational, and memorable experience for inner-city youth who decide to be a part of the program. It is a 5-week camp filled with hands-on interactive activites, field trips (i.e. swim lessons, Indianapolis Public Library visits, and the Soul Circus), and speakers coming to empower the youth.The kids want to have a safe, fun summer. We hope that through your donations, the Rose of Hope Foundation can give them that kind of experience!Sincerely in Service,Brooke Moreland-WilliamsRose of Hope Foundation Executive Director www.roseofhopefoundation.org

Previously she participated in a Braille Challenge and won first at state in her division and 7th out of all the United States and Canada! She now has the opportunity to travel to Los Angeles and compete nationally in June. Because of the short notice of the competition we ask of your help for transportation, lodging, and eating so that we can fulfill Hayden's dream.

Creating Community Healing Retreat,"$1,000 ","$50,000 ",Events," March 4, 2015",27,19,GREEN BAY,WI,511000,,18,"

GREEN BAY, WI                                




This is a modest endeavor in the creation of peace and healing in the world...My vision is to create a healing, tranquil retreat place for people locally and those willing to travel to benefit from and utilize. I so strongly believe in the healing power of our minds, our intentions and our community of choice, that I am working to acquire this healing space in tiny Rapid River, MI to rehab from a quaint, tidy motel to a thriving hub of support, healing, and growth.Your contribution to my quest will be used for maintenance to the Native American community and spirituality features of the motel including a wabeno used for sacred talking circles, sweat lodge, longhouse, and more. I also really want to rebuild a labyrinth onsite as another healing opportunity for those who visit. Contributions will also defray costs of the programming already planned, including Breathwork retreats, talking circles, a sacred vessel workshop, and more.I'm Bonnie Nussbaum, a licensed psychologist and holistic coach who has spent 25 years providing care for those who have experienced trauma. I'm shifting now from outpatient mental health offering traditional psychotherapy to a more specialized, deep holistic core healing approach which I've been building for the past 4 years.Aspects of this location that support my belief that this is a prime space for the work above include its long history as a Native American gathering place, the  https://www.empowermentandpurpose.com history of sacred wisdom traditions surrounding this area, the many ""coincidences"" that have led this venture thus far and strong connections to nature including the adjacent National Forest and nearby Lake Michigan.In fact, another retreat center in another state uses this facility for THEIR annual retreat! What better testimonial to this great space could you get? Speaking of testimonials, I have asked several individuals who have utilized this wonderful place for retreat in the past to write what it has meant to them. Watch for their testimonials in the future...

                                                I've been asked by the Sanders campaign to be on the Democratic Platform Committee and stand for #integritypolitics - fighting for the Democratic Platform to include a ban on fracking, bold action on climate change, environmental justice and some other critical progressive policy measures. But I need help to get there. As many of you know, I've dedicated my life to advocacy and fighting against injustice, which means that my soul is intact, but my bank account is anemic. Can you please help me to go to both Orlando to attend a critical Platform Committee meeting andto also get to Philadephia for the Democratic National Convention? At both of these events, I promise to be a servant to the many critical issues that we are facing, which the Sanders campaign has so boldly embraced.  I'm honored to be a partof the political revolution - and believe that my actions can make a difference. Because I'm on the Platform Committee from California, and was invited very late in the game - I need to get my planet tickets and hotels booked pronto. The Platform Committee meets in Orlando on July 9 and I need to be in Philadelphia by July 24. Thanks so much for your help! Much love,David

8/31/2016UPDATE: Hello Class of '86!! Please pay for your Reunion tickets here. :) The cost is $55 per ticket. If you would rather send in a check or money order, that is fine as well. Just let me know via email (vja1986@yahoo.com) and I will let you know what to do.All remaining monies, once we've paid our 30th reunion bills, will remain in our account until the next class event and/or our 35th or 40th reunion. We will discuss the next reunion at a later date. One is enough for now!! LOL!!Thanks so much!!____________________________________________________________""We're the class that really kicks, we're the class of 86'!!"" Hello Everyone!! This is the very beginning of our 16 monthjourney to the VJA Class of 86' 30 YearReunion scheduled the weekend of October 7th through October 9th, 2016. As I'm sure you are all aware, putting together an event of this magnitude requires a bit of funding, above and beyondour per personreception cost, in order to get the ball rolling. This page has been set up in order to gather funds for things like venue deposit (approximately $1,500-$2,000, which would be applied towards our total cost for the evening), band deposit/cost, decorations, name tags, favors, etc. I would also like to be able to extend assistance to any of our classmates who would be unable to attend the reunion otherwise. I was in a very bad position myself several years ago, which was one of the reasons I did not attend the 20 year reunion. I wish that I had, as life is so short, butunfortunately it was notfinanciallyfeasible for me at the time. Anyway, this is just a thought and all ""reunion scholarships"" would be given based on need and held within the strictest ofconfidence. The funds used for these scholarships would come only afterthe money we raised together on thissite was used to pay for everything else neededas listed above. In addition, if there was any money left, we could also make a donation to a cause in honor of one or more of our gone too soon classmates. Please note that an itemized list of all expenditures will beavailable upon request at any time.Thank you so much, in advance, for your anticipated contributions to our celebration. I amlooking forward to seeing everyone, meeting your partners, seeing your pictures and spending precious time with some amazing people. I hope you are as excited as I am and look forward to making this the BESTreunionyet. Lotsof ""Thunderbolt"" Love and Pride,  Jackie Dellamano VJAClass of 1986

                        Date: October 10th, 2015Location: 1408 Washtenaw AveGame starts at 11:00 A.M.The Mudbowl is a storied tradition of The University of Michigan's Greek System. For those not familiar with the Mudbowl, the actual game is played in frigid, shin deep mud and is a culmination of a campus-wide fraternity football tournament. It is an event that unites visiting parents and alumni, students and the Ann Arbor community.While we are proud of the Mudbowl and its storied tradition, I am also writing to inform you of the primary philanthropic purpose that the Mudbowl has evolved to serve. On behalf of the University of Michigan Health System, we are excited to be fundraising for the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. I am seeking your help for the children battling illness and injury and their doctors who are pioneering innovative procedures and conducting advanced research. There is a special opportunity here for us to have great impact on a number of lives.The money that we donate to Mott Children's Hospital will go specifically to support the Block Out Cancer fundraiser and raising money for Pediatric Cancer Research. You can rest assured that 90 percent of all tax-deductible donations will go directly to the Block Out Cancer Fund and that this is an incredible cause that achieves extraordinary results. Please consider giving generously. The following is a description of the fund from the UM Health System's website:""Every day, 43 children are diagnosed with cancer. Despite everything doctors know about treating childhood cancers, we still don't have cures for many of these diseases. In fact, for rare, resistant and difficult to treat cancers, we're no further along in knowing how to save these kids than we were 40 years ago. At the same time, scientists are on the brink of incredible breakthroughs. With advances in genetic sequencing, epigenetic research, and precision medicine, we're closer to cures than ever before. Now's the time to make a difference. You don't have to be a millionaire or a brilliant scientist. If we band together, each of us has the potential to be a part of solving this problem. Please consider showing your support by donating today  or join our team in raising more money for cures. Every dollar you contribute will go directly towards funding groundbreaking innovative research taking place at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital.""In addition to donating the majority of our proceeds to the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, we are also donating 10% of total funds raised in order to help support the cause of a fellow student, Taylor Janssen. For those who do not know, Taylor Janssen is a student at the University of Michigan  a 19 year old from Michigan who is fighting the battle of his life after an accident from diving into shallow water. He is a friend to most of us here at the University of Michigan, and we want to show our support for a fellow classmate, and a fellow friend to us all.It is my hope that you will be inspired to forward this e-mail along to friends, family, and organizations. All donations, sponsorships and promotions will be greatly valuable and will help a child have a better future. Feel free to donate on behalf of any person or organization. This year, we are seeking to raise a record amount of $30,000.

                        Hello Everyone! I am a mom of a daughter with autism, who wants to put together an extra special prom for herand her classmates.The Country School, part of Teri, Inc. (aNon-Profitspecial needs school is located in San Marcos, CA) The prom students attend the middle school class, high school class and the practical skills class. For a lot of these students it will be their very first prom/dance. Some of the students have attended in the past. In the past, prom has been held in our small multi-purpose room, with food and cake bought from our local grocery stores. Our DJ is an iphone set up by one of the adults or students from another private school that attends our dances and helps us get up and groovin'. This year we would love to have an extra special prom at a venue in Carlsbad. This place includes catered food/snacks and beverages. We also want to hire a DJ and have a custom cake or cupcakes. The theme this year is ""Under the Sea"". We would love to also purchase a few decorations to brighten up the venue. I would also love to have enough funds to lower the cost of the prom ticket from $40 to $20 or less. Our prom will be held on May 13, 2016. So we would need the funds asap. These students work so hard throughout the year! They deserve an extra special prom that will be talked about for the years to come. A local private school students volunteer their time to come to the event and encourage our students to dance and participate. They teach them the newest dance moves and get even the shyest students up and moving. Just to see the smiles on the faces of these extra special students is priceless.  Please please donate as much as you can and make the day of these great students. We will be forever grateful! From all the parents: we thank you for being so kind to our students. It's the small things that bring so much joy to our lives as special needs parents. Thank you thank you thank you :)

BELLFLOWER, CA                                




The Southern California Diversity IN Leadership Conference! IN Conference 2015 Date: October 1-2, 2015 Time: Thursday & Friday, 8:00am -5:30pm Location : California State University, Long BeachDid you know:Diversity is a central strength of our nation. However, our businesses have yet to become reflective of this in their leadership and decision making ranks. Indicators across industries are alarming. According to the Center on American Progress (2012):Nonprofits: 82% of employees are white and 18% are people of color (10 percent are African American; 5 percent are Hispanic; 3 percent are other; and 1 percent are Asian). Yet in the working-age population 64 % are non-Hispanic white and 36 % are people of color.Corporate Boardrooms: The statistics are so alarming that it is embarrassing to report. (People of color represent less than 5% and there are fewer than 16 women leading fortune 500 companies in our country)Future Projections:  Hispanics will be vastly underrepresented in Senior Executive Positions by 2030, making up less than 10%.   Women will continue to be underrepresented in senior positions, making up less than 40% by 2030.  This is a new era in workforce diversity in our country and research confirms the need to include people of minority races, gender, and circumstances in leadership and decision-making ranks.  The purpose of the conference is to educate the professional/business community about the benefits of diversity and inclusion IN Leadership, while offering the latest tools for practical implementation. We focus on current issues in the society and in organizations that effect change in order to provide a nexus of support for our participants. The hope of the conference is to get a variety of industries, organizations and individuals all IN.Mission: We seek to make diversity an integral part of the ""big picture' in leadership, and the main function of organizational growth by encouraging people to:  Embrace how their cultural dynamics contribute to a stronger organization  Teach practical methods to move through diversifying to inclusion; in order to effect change  Impact the current lack of diversity in organizational leadership  Empower future leaders through education Vision: Our vision is to create a stronger workforce by embracing the cultural values of its people and integrating those values IN leadership in order to promote productivity for businesses across industries. AFRAM GLOBAL ORGANIZATION INC is a not-for-profit organization that is the fiscal partner for this event. As such, it has no designated budget for the Southern California Diversity IN Leadership Conference. The conference is planned and organized by volunteers and no member of the planning committee is compensated for his or her services. 100% of moneys raised through donations/sponsorships will supplement the cost for operation of the conference and registration to the conference, allowing students and people with lower economic capacity to attend. This conference is only possible, because of financial support of corporate and local partnerships.  Your contribution is tax deductible and your generosity is greatly appreciated.

He has said the conference is too important to miss and will spend his own money to attend.He has a travel budget. It is for travel. What better use than for our Mayor to attend a national conference for mayors. Hartnoted:I cant think of a time, even in a budget crisis, when a mayor was denied the chance to go to a conference when the money is there.One of the no-voting council members said ""Weve never had a mayor go to this conference before.""Well, this city elected this Mayor. This Mayor is trying to do his job.Those who fund this effort are saying:(1) Let ourMayor do thejob we elected him to do.(2) Let ourMayor engage with other mayors across the country at a professional conference so that he may bring knowledge and expertise back to our city to benefit Waterloo.(3) We support ourMayor's efforts to improve Waterloo. (4) He won this election, and if our city council as a whole will not support him the citizens of Waterloo will.Even a $1 donation will show the Mayor and the city council that we will not let 3 men block the efforts of a duly elected mayor and the interests of nearly 70,000 city of Waterloo residents.Anyfundsdonated will be givento the Mayor for the express use to cover histravel expenses to this conference. The campaign will be closed when the target goal is reached. [Edit 6/23/16--Funding will now be for the 2017 US Mayors Conference in Washington DC. The donation will be given to his campaign organization Hart for Mayor for disbursement].*Disclaimer* I am a Waterloo resident. I am not related to, or affiliated with the Mayor. I have never met him. I am just a concerned citizen.Link to recent Courier article: http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-council-turns-down-mayor-s-travel-request/article_2c3f7f9d-61fc-55ba-9a80-8bad41ea4477.html

"Manabumi Eco-Retreat, Hawaii","$3,000 ","$5,000 ",Events," July 9, 2015",47,14,OAK PARK,IL,448000,1,28,"






                            Alexandra Haban
                            
                            
                                                           
OAK PARK, IL                                




The mission and vision of Manabumi Retreat and Ecovillage on Big Island, Hawaii is to build a place where we can come together and experience a sense of community. We would like to create a space in which we can reconnect with our natural state of being one with the natural world, and to awaken and inspire a deep want to care for the planet.The word Manabumi is inspired by the Sanskrit words Mana = Spirit and Bhumi=Land. All structures we are building on Manabumi, will be build in harmony with Aina, the spirit of the land.Manabumi welcomes all races, creeds, genders, and ideologies. At Manabumi we focus on that which connects us rather than what we think divides us. Manabumi nurtures that spirit in us that make us seek a sense of tribal community, a feeling of belonging and purpose within a greater sense of being.We explore alternative ways of living that are in harmony with the land, using ethics and appropriate technologies. Our visitors will stay in structures such as Wall Tents and Super Adobe Earth Shelters.Whether individuals are seeking to reconnect with themselves, the community, feeling the earth in their hands in one of our hands-on sustainable living workshops, or simply come to recharge from a busy city life, Manabumi strives to hold a space for anyone interested in way of living that is healthy for them and the world around them.

We have the passion and heart to put all of ourselves into this amazing project. We are: Jesse, Christopher, Tomek and Alexandra. We don't have a lot of monetary funds, but with your help, we will bring to life this beautiful vision.

Some of the workshops we are planning to offer are:

- Hatha Yoga- Budokon Yoga- RYT 200 Yoga Teacher Training- Massage Therapy- Vermicomposting- Organic Gardening- Plant based cooking- Natural BeekeepingWe intend to focus on workshops that will let visitors take the knowledge back home with them so they may use what they learned at Manabumi in their own homes, apartments and communities. We hope to inspire us all to find practical solutions for our every day, modern challenges.

Manabumi would like to provide a space for indigeneous people to come and share their deep, cultural heritage with visitors who come to stay with us.Manabumi will have several gardent intended to feed the caretakers, visitors and eventually, the greater community.Building elements1. Central cooking & community space2. Central yoga, exercise, massage, class gazebo platform3. As eco-friendly/green as possible using photovoltaics, permaculture, composting, etc..4. As many different building elements as possible (bamboo, super adobe, shipping container, local Hawaii lumbers, tiny houses, yurts).5. Rentable & demonstrable benefits from building for ecotourism, vacations, tourism, & retreatsCommunity focus1. Teaching locals yoga, massage, exercise, detox, nutrition2. We network with likeminded experts in health & wellness3. We create programs if necessary to meet our purpose(s) & unmet needs of the community4. In this order - Fern Acres, Kea'au, Hilo, Wet side of Big Island, Big Island, HawaiiEco-Agriculture1. Locally grown vegetables2. Permaculture principles: Convergence of common sense, indigenous wisdom and appropriate technology3. Conservation of native plants and eradication of invasive plant species4. Composting with worms5. Educational programs within Hawaiian cultural frameworksWe have already begun to build and the first structure, a Yoga/Massage studio, is nearly completed.

The two most important first items we need to build, and we will need support with, is access to energy in form of sustainable, solar power and a water catchmen system. We will catch rain water for all our water needs as we are not connected to city water.

For these two imporant infrastructures, we ask your help. Part of our team is moving permanently to the Big Island in November 2015 to build. We would like to purchase the photovoltaic cells and water catchment system in advance so everything can be put in place as soon as we get there. During this process we will continuously update you with photos of the construction process.

We are greatful for anyone who helps us make this vision become reality and, once we are ready to receive visitors, are welcoming you for a stay with us.

With gratitude,Jesse, Christopher, Tomek and AlexThe Manabumi TeamThe funds we are requesting will be used for:

Fendig Summer Theatre for Children is celebrating 40 years as a not for profit organization bringing quality programs to the Jasper County community. The production of Mary Poppins will be on July 9,10 and 11 at 7:00 pm in the Rensselaer High School Auditorium.Fendig Summer Theatre has 76 children participating. The program participants are children in grades 4 through 8, no children are turned away and every participant plays a part in the production. Adults help with teaching the skills needed to put on a quality show such as rehearsals for acting, singing, dancing, set building, costumes, lighting, sound, and stage management but the night of the performance it is all the responsibility of the children. Fendig Summer Theatre is for the children and by the children.Our Program cannot exist without the support of others. In order to make the show ""Practically Perfect in Every Way,"" we are seeking funds to defray the cost of sets, costumes, and ""special effects,"" needed to bring the magic to life.Donations and ticket sales help us pay the production costs for the current performance year as well as provides enough funds to license the next years show. However, the past five years we have been doing major repairs to the Fendig Warehouse. The warehouse allows the program to cut down the set and costuming costs not only for us, but many other groups in the area seeking to use the resources collected.Please consider donating to this GoFundMe drive to raise enough funds during this season to reach our goals:Goals:1. Cover costs of our 40th Anniversary production for 2015--- MARY POPPINS2. Flying Effects by ZFX Flying Effects3. New trusses for the Fendig WarehouseThe generousity of the The Jasper Foundation and TheJasper County REMC Community Fund Grant has helped us start a wonderful production year.This year we are also happy to announce that Pat Collins (our very first director and one of the founders) is back to direct.  Other members of our production team areHelen Heinig ( Assistant Director),Claudia Earnest ( Music Director) and Blake Rushing (Choreographer).Please go to our website fendigtheatre.org for more information.Check out the new categories! Ruth Anne Bontreger has graciously agreed to make pillows and or blankets for people willing to donate in these new categories for our fundraiser! Ruth Anne Bontreger and her daughter, Tricia Gastineau have been the power behind Fendig's costuming needs. You ladies rock!

                        Happy 12th Birthday to Ryan today!!! I am not sure where the time went on our crazy journey, but I am GRATEFUL for every day. 10 years ago you were diagnosed with an ugly Brain Tumor that took your sight permanently right before your 2nd Birthday. You have tackled every challenge that has been placed before you and accomplished so much in your first 12 years. I am so PROUD of you, all you do and can not wait to see what the future holds for you on this AWESOME journey!!!!Ryan doesn't usually ask for anything for himself for his Birthday, as many of you know. He has raised money for several years for many local & national organizations. This year is different. Ryan competed last spring in the regional Braille Challenge and scored high enough to be asked to compete in the National Braille Challenge that were held in Los Angeles. He met so many talented kids like him on his trip and Ryan is hoping to be asked to compete again this year. The Braille Institute does not pay for air fare, car rental, etc... He has asked that I set up this Go Fund Me page for him to raise money to get to California in June 2016. Ryan asked me to thank you all for making the time to send him birthday wishes, if you have the ability to donate to his trip thank you and if you share his page, thank you.Have a GREAT day and HAPPY 12th BIRTHDAY RyRy!!!

____________________________ 


Hello, my name is Alexandria Stanier. I am 19 years old and I am trying to raise the money to go to Philadelphia, PA for the Democratic National Convention July 25-29. 


I have recently been elected as a delegate at large for the state of Indiana, by the Indiana Democratic Committee at the Indiana Democratic Convention in Indianapolis. 


Being a delegate to the National Convention means a lot to me, because it is a once in a life time experience. As a young democrat I am excited to participate on this level of the democratic process. 


Any money raised will go to transportation to and from Philadelphia, hotel costs, and food while I am at the convention. Please donate if you can, any amount will help me get closer to the convention. 


Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

Our WISH(Walking in Support and Hope) and Anoxic Brain Injury friends have set up a Retreat for Caregivers.The Retreat is set for the end of September, in Door County Wisconsin.

That being said, we are looking for support from our family and friends to help alleviate some of the financial burden- including airfare(for some), the cost of the house, and other incidentals including food.

Beautiful but frail, she was immediately placed in the NICU, primarily because of a need for oxygen. While in the NICU, the doctors and nurses discovered several new areas of concern; Jayla was not eating well, and failed more than a couple newborn hearing screenings. Jayla remained in the NICU for seven long weeks. I just remember test after test with the doctors trying to figure out what was going on with our sweet girl.It was a local neurologist who saw Jayla during those NICU days that ordered an important test that would eventually help in figuring out this puzzle. Because her eating on her own never improved, her first of several surgeries was the placement of a feeding tube. Upon release from the NICU, Jayla was referred to Childrens Hospital in Denver, CO. At this point, she still had not received a diagnosis. At three months old, the results from the tests our neurologist ordered were instrumental in a diagnosis of Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorder (PBD). We really didnt receive much information during that first meeting at Childrens Hospital; the only thing I really remember was the doctor saying the majority of the babies diagnosed with this disorder only live a year or two and that there was no real treatment. Of course, we were devastated but have adjusted to this new normal. Today, Jayla has surpassed all that was expected of her. Jayla is legally deaf blind and has been going to Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind for the past 3 years where she has learned so much and CSDB gives us some support with her disabilities. Another support group we have been fortunate to find is the Global Foundation of Peroxisomal Disorders (GFPD), which is a resource for families that have a child with PBD. Our family has been able to communicate and meet other families with children with PBDthrough GFPD. This summer they are hosting a conference in Omaha, Nebraska for families and medical professionals passionate about PBD. Jayla will be able to be seen by some of these medical professionals in attendence, along with being able to be around other families and children with PBD. We just need financial help to get there and make this happen. I started this GoFundMe in hopes that our family, friends and new friends can share this and donate so we can pay for the conference fees, hotel, travel expenses and food while we are there. If you want to learn more about Jayla's disorder you can visit  www.thegfpd.org.We appreciate everyone's help!

                        On September 11th I'll start my next year of life. It's been a pretty great year this year but I have a good feeling the next year is going to be even better.But thousands of LGBTQ youth won't be celebrating their birthday this year because of the constant bullying and even horrific conversion therapy they must endure.So I use a time of year to do some good. Let's raise $1000 to be sent to Trevor Project. They offer an amazing hotline for those of us who are facing suicide and continuously work with me to erradicate conversion therapy.So help me celebrate my birthday and let's save the lives of LGBTQ youth in the process.As a REWARD for you being awesome: I'll pick one of those of you to donate and you will get a thank you call from a very special someone - the First Lady of the United States (she thinks this is an awesome idea).

Unfortunately, excess security needs, record heat and a little rain on the parade stretched the budget thin. OKC Pride is the largest privately-held event in Oklahoma and is free to attendees and supported entirely by the generosity of our community.

OKLAHOMA CITY, OK                                




My family and I have taken family vacations for 20+years. In the recent years, there have been extenuating circumstances leading to not being able to do this.  Now, Mom has stage 4 metastasized triple negative breast cancer in her bones, liver and lungs. She has been fighting it with chemo and radiation for almost 4 years. Treatment is no longer an option.  Mom's husband is now elderly and recently broke his hip and is in a nursing home now. The hardships emotionally have been very difficult to endure, for her.  Family is helping take care of her as she has 6 months to a year, without treatment, to live. She has cared for her elderly husband through the years leading up to her cancer and has not been able to take a vacation with family. Her husband is now being cared for permanently by assisted living. She has a chance to go on a much wanted cruise with kids and grandkids. Momma has ALWAYS wanted to do this. Time is of the essence. We can't afford, as a family, to fly AND cruise so we are cruising out of Galveston Port from Oklahoma City in 6 weeks which is risky because of the nature of her disease.  If we could get help with the trip, her one last family vacation wish will be granted. Thank you so much for your thoughts and good energy and mostly your generosity. All of that has mattered all along and made a real difference.

You had to make the run in a set time to be able to train as a Paratrooper. For every soldier that made it many more did not. Even those who did not had much to give to others they trained with from what they learned making our Army then the respected soldiers they were.The Greatest Generation is quickly fading from our physical grasp though not from our minds and history books. This page is setup to help bring some of our last remaining Veterans to once again see their famed mountain they trained on. And also to share once again their memories with the public. A chance before it slips from our grasp to live their life, share their memories, take them up Currahee Mountain and get their autographs on some of our most cherished items.Please help us get these Veterans once again to Currahee, to that storied place of the 101st Airborne Division. Rain or shine, once again they will reach the top of Currahee Mountain.The donation time is short. The event is the first weekend of October. Sept 30 to Oct 2.

                        Please adopt me to go to Philly to fight for Bernie for President where the Democratic Party Convention is being held!PhilosophyI am a scientist and an engineer by education, a small business owner for the last 30+ years, a 35+ years resident of Orange County, and a long-time activist for causes pertaining to improved quality of life for all citizens of our great country. I believe in an effective and efficient Government, focused on issues of the common good that can only be addressed through an honest democratic process by citizen legislators, representing WE the People not by career politicians representing narrow special interests. I believe in the free market system, but not in crony capitalism which privatizes profits and socializes losses. I believe in a free market system with adequate safeguards for consumers and protection of our environment. I believe in a free market system with a level playing field between capital and labor, one that provides safe working conditions and living wages not subject to threats of outsourcing.HistoryI was elected a Bernie Delegate on May 1st of this year. Later, on June 7th Primary Election, I won a top-two spot forU.S. Congress 45th District as a Berniecrat. Ive been an elected Central Committee Delegate to the California Democratic Party since 2011. I was running MoveOn.org Irvine and South Orange County chapter for about 1.5 years from 2010 to 2012.I first met Senator Bernie Sanders back in early 2011 in Sacramento at the California Democratic Convention after he spoke as our keynote speaker and addressed our Progressive Caucus membership. I got a chance to speak to Bernie one-on-one for about 4 minutes. I told him that he is one of my heroes, he is very much loved in Orange County California, and I could fill a very large venue where folks would pay to come to see him speak. He did a double take and wanted to make sure were talking about the same belly-of-the-beast Orange County. I like to think that I helped him to get to thinking that perhaps he could very much be a viable candidate for President of the United States of America.Later in 2011, I became one of the founders and organizers of Occupy Orange County. Having spent countless hours days and nights there collaborating with the residents, I learned so much what it truly means to be a Progressive and that not just any Democrat can claim to be a Progressive. In fact most claim to be Progressive but very few are actually Progressive!My speaking to Senator Sanders and playing a big role in the Occupy movement had such a profound and powerful effect on me, that a year later I chose to run for U.S. Congress with much of the same platform Bernie has been running on. And, Ive been a Progressive Berniecrat ever since. Unfortunately, I lost my first bid that year, but vowed to run againIve been the Chair of West Orange County Democrats since 2013 and Ive also been the host and member of Progressive Democrats of America since 2013.2016This year, I couldnt resist from running again, especially since my hero Bernie was running as well. I truly think this could be our year, this year. This is our political revolution and regardless of who becomes our next President, the makeup of our Congress will be reshaped with lots of newly elected Progressive Berniecrats. Im 1 of 5 Sanders Democrats that won their June 7th elections and one of only two Sanders Democrats in OC that won their Primary elections. PhillyUnfortunately, because Bernie didnt get enough votes in our 45th District to clinch a majority vote, only a portion of his elected delegates get to go to Philadelphia as pledged Delegates and I am not one of them. However, as I promised those who voted for me, I will be going to Philadelphia any way and I will be doing my very best to try to get in the convention and attend as many meetings as I can while Im there. I will also be outside the convention with the rallies and protests in support of Bernie.My initial estimate, a month ago, was $7,600 to reach Philly! But, now that I know Im not a confirmed Bernie Delegate, I do not have to stay in one of their expensive hotels and I do not have to pay dues that are expected from confirmed Delegates. So, the new figures are now $2,458.Roundtrip Airfare $767Lodging/Room $691Food & Other Expenses$600Ground Transportation/Parking $400========================================Grand Total $2,458Campaign Is it acceptable in America that the top 0.1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%? Is it acceptable that 99% of new income is going to the top 1%? Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? This is why we must overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections!Is it right that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, most of our young people either can't afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better!We must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, increases income, protects the environment, addresses climate change, failed trade policies, and immigration reform, makes public college education attainable, provides healthcare for all, strengthens Social Security, Medicare, Tricare, and ADA, and promotes diplomacy over war?Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.( http://ElectRonV.com)Please adopt me to go to Philly to fight for Bernie for President where the Democratic Party Convention is being held!

Help Us Add 25 Hives in 25 Days - that's 1,500,000 New Honeybees inOur Community!

I hear it all the time. Friends and family members who hear about my beekeeping & raw honey business and wish they had ""the guts"" to try it themselvesbut are too afraid or don't have the time to commit to it. Like me, they know that having a healthy honeybee population is vitalto our community and that local, raw, honey is in high demand. But it seems like a big step between ""wanting to do something"" and actually installing a beehive in your own backyard and being responsible for the colony of bees.

Trust me, I get it. And it got me thinking.My goal for this summer is to expand the number of hives I manage significantly.My goal is to add another 25beehives to my business this year, but I can't do that alone. Why? It costs money (roughly $270/hive) to buy all the equipment and honeybees I need to expand. And that expense has to be paid up front during months when honey sales are at their lowest.

We all know honeybees are incredibly important to our pollination and the health of our food supply. I have farmers begging me to put beehives on their property, but I don't have enoughbees to help them out.So, what if we combined our needs and desires to make this happen? What could we do together?Here's how I picture this working.

1.You help sponsor a hive financially in part or in whole2. For every $270 raised I'll buy all the equipment required to start a new hive and manage it on your behalf.3. You get to feel good about helping support a colony of bees (without the hassle of having to open the hive and poke around at them)4. I get to expand my operation, make farmers happy and increase our local,raw honey supply5.I'll send you a picture of your beehive and put your name on the box as one of the sponsorsHow awesome is that? It's a great way to be proactive about a problem you care about, without getting stung.

SWEET REWARDS: If you live in the area, our family willhost a special GoFundMe celebration party and those of you who can attend will be able to come sample our tasty honey and take home a jar of your favorite for FREE.

Donate $10 = 6oz of your favorite BeeKing's honeyDonate $20 = 12 oz of your favorite BeeKing's honeyDonate $50 = 36 oz of your favorite BeeKing's honeyDonate $100 = A half gallon of honey from your hive (plus a special beeswax body care kit)Donate $270 = A full gallon of honey from your hive (plus a special beeswax body care kit)

Oh yeah, ifby chance we exceed our current goal we'll update our campaign page to account for additional beekeeping tools/supplies that I've been looking forward to purchasing or hold the funds for next year's expansion. Trust me, there is never a shortfall of financial needs in a small agricultural business like ours.Every little bit helps. There is no minimum pledge to participate in helping out. If you want to help butaren't able to donateto this campaign, you can also consider supporting us by simply sharing a link to this site on your social media. Or maybe you just want tobuy a jar or two of our honey online this month.

Either way, we really appreciate all of the love and support our family and friends have shown over the years. From our hive to yours, thank you & bee blessed.

                        As you know, Hailey will be graduating with her Master's Degree in Business Administration from Lindenwood University this month. People have asked what she would want for a gift, and her response is always ""Lasik"".Lasik is expensive, and she is saving money herself while paying for school and working full-time. Here's where you come in - every little bit would help towards her goal for perfect vision. So the proposal is to contribute to that goal with money you may have spent on a graduation gift, or even Birthday and Christmas gifts for Hailey this year.Hailey is the most driven and caring person I know, and I cannot think of anyone who is more deserving of everything great. I'd love to get her started off well as she transitions from college into her career, and I know she would appreciate any assistance her friends and family will provide.Now Hailey doesn't know about this yet, but I'd like to show it to her later this month, as her last night of school is September 20.Thank you!

                        For the past seven years as the FHS Band Director, Mrs. Umhoefer has been dedicating as much of her time as possible (and maybe a little more) to every student, co-worker, friend, family member, and basically anyone she's ever known. With all that ooey-gooey nonsense said, Ms. Schlecht (FHS Choir Director) and I came up with the idea of raising money to get Mrs. Umhoefer tickets to see Hamilton for her birthday (Sept. 28) for her and her husband. We want to give her an awesome birthday surprise, not only because she absolutely adores the broadway musical, but because she deserves to have an amazing night being there in person to experience it! With your help, we can raise the money to make this incredible time happen! Find a dollar in the street? Donate it! Find a nickel under your couch cushion? Send it on in! Every penny matters! Whether its one penny or one hundred thousand of them, every little bit helps! Everyone and anyone can donate, so spread the word, but make sure to keep it quiet, as we don't want Mrs. Umhoefer finding out about this (hense the surprise!) Thank you so much for any donation made, we look forward to giving her a night well deserved, and dont forget to wish Mrs. Umhoefer a happy birthday!

                        As you know every year we host a fundraiser for Brian. Spread the word, bring a friend. It's going to be a amazing event.This years event is going to be held atDavid Posnack JCC5850 S Pine Island Rd, Davie, Florida 33328Saturday, October 24th 2015Every now and then we all come across someone or something that inspires us. One of the things that always amazes me is the way that Brian Cousineau is able to go through life under very challenging circumstances with such dignity. For those of you who don't know Brian or those who just haven't seen him since high school he is an incredible guy. Despite being confined to a wheel chair and having several serious medical issues he is able to always maintain a positive attitude and seems to enjoy life. I don't think that I could handle his situation with a tenth of the class that he does. In high school I remember Brian being a very energetic, athletic, wise ass boy. He played all of the sports and was always into something. He wasn't the type of kid to loaf around the house and read a book. A lot of kids today are content to stay home and play on the computer or just text their friends. I think that Brian would have gone nuts if those were his options while growing up. Shortly after high school doctors found some type of growth on his spinal cord. I'm not exactly sure the terminology for it or what type of surgery they did but I do know that after the surgery he was confined to a electric wheel chair. (paralzed from waist down) If he was a nerdy kid who was a book worm I think it would have been easier for him to adjust but he was a kid who had ants in his pants and couldn't sit still. How was he going to cope with this? I was away in college when I first heard about his situation. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Oh my god what? I saw him about a year later for the first time. He looked the same but now he was in a chair. I was amazed that he didn't seem pissed. He accepted his situation, but had faith that he would one day be out of the chair. That was 27 years ago. I don't know what he thinks now or how he manages to have such a positive outlook on life, but he does, and that's all that really matters. Anyone who feels depressed should spend a few days in his shoes and I'm sure that they would have a whole different outlook on life. He's a very inspirational figure and has a stable of women that he pimps out to pay for his medical bills. I remember when he called me and said that one of his bit%$es kept coming up short. I explained that his legs might not work but that his pimp hand was still strong. He told me that the problem was that she was to tall for the pimp hand. I knew that we had a solvable problem. I started calling around to find out who could build him a monster chair or put some hydrolics on his. We developed a prototype but he kept falling out of the thing when he was chasing his girls around trying to collect his money. I knew that we had to come up with another solution, something that nobody else had thought of yet. That's when I had one of my best ideas ever........Midget Hoes. He's been strong in the game ever since. Sure they try and outrun him, bo legs and all. It's a sight to see him chasing them around in that souped up chair. They've got no chance of getting away unless the chair runs out of juice. Even then he has this tiny little lasso that he can throw 20 feet and wrap around a carrot. To see him lasso one of them is a special treat. We hooked up a power winch to his chair so that when he gets them he just reels them in. Damn this stuff is good. Where was I? Oh yeah, Brian, The chair, midget hoes. I don't know what's wrong with me. I started writing about a guy who I really admire and then my mind started to wonder and before you know it I've slandered my buddy. Someone call my attorneys. I feel a pending lawsuit coming on. The reason that I chose now to write about Brian is because his party/fundraiser is coming up Saturday 10/24/15. (Date changed was last yr date) Its's a great time and it's for a great cause. I've been going for over 20 years and it gets better every year. His medical costs are very expensive and this event goes a long way to paying for his care. I don't think that there is a set price. You just donate whatever you want. There is great food and plenty of drink. You'll see lots of people that you probably haven't seen in years. If you don't know Brian you can still come. He'll be the guy in the chair with the lasso. I look forward to it every year. It's at the David Posnack, Jewish Community Center in Davie,Come one come all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Author: John RoganPhoto taken at a past Fund Raiser party 2 years ago. Brian Cousineau and his beloved Father. May he rest in peace. We miss you Jerry.

Music is a huge part of my life and continues to be a great source of my joy. In a few weeks, I'll be turning fifty. When I thought about what I could do to celebrate the answer seemed obvious: Share the Music! So, Ive launched this campaign to raise to bring instruments to some of the kids in my community.To start, I've asked two local music teachers what they would love to have in their classroom: Bryan Fay, from Potowmack Elementary School, where my own kids received a great musical education, and Melinda Windsor from Guilford Elementary, where music is taught, despite limited space or resources.Both teachers have given me their wish lists. With your help, they'll receive xylophones, drums, egg shakers, rhythm sticks and more. You can sponsor individual items, or you can make a blanket donation. My hope is that this campaign will blossom, and well be able to assist even more schools down the road!By participating, you will help to connect kids with the language everyone is born understanding. Its my birthday, but its your gift to the kids.Thank you so much for helping my birthday wish come true!Maura

                        Hi my name is Jia Stotts. I was born in Guangdong China in 2006 and spent the first 3 1/2 years of my life in an orphanage in MaoMing. In 2009, I was adopted and moved to Missouri with my family. I now have a large wonderful family, including a little sister also adopted from China.I am turning 10 and for the last few months I have wanted to collect money to donate to my orphanage in China. So to celebrate my double digits, I asked my family and friends to give money to my orphanage instead of giving me gifts. My mom contacted our adoption agency and they are helping me get the money to my orphanage in China. I hope it will help them pay for things the children there need like bottles, blankets, food or play equipment.This means so much to me because the orphanage took good care of me and I want to help the children that are there now. My mom tells everyone that I have a big, kind heart and am always doing nice things for others. When I grow up I hope to be a childrens doctor.I really hope you will help me raise the money. I told my mom I wanted to raise $80 and she said I could do more than that! My mom said people are always looking for a way to help others and give back and also that so many people love me, they would be happy to help me celebrate my double digit birthday in this way.I feel very lucky to be adopted and hope all the children in my orphanage find a family to. I want them to know that they have not been forgotten about and that someone thinks of them and prays for them. I hope by sending them this gift, they will know that. I also hope the aiys in the orphanage know that their work is appreciated.Please give!!! Even $5 will help! Thank you! Jia

                        My dad was a very simple man. He didn't ask for much from anyone and did everything he could for everyone. He is the most respectful, loyal, and kind person I know. Unfortunately that amazing man passed away monday morning. Me and my brothers would like to go out there and put him to rest but the sudden passing gave us no time to prepare or save for it. Any donation is greatly appreciated.

Collin Reynolds Birthday Benefit,"$1,100 ","$2,000 ",Events," August 13, 2015",26,13,BURLINGTON,VT,315000,,5,"

                        Collin Reynolds was an inspiration to Vermont, Musicians, his community, his family, and eventually the world. Collin had a life long battle with Cystic Fibrosis, a battle which ulitmately overcame him March 11. Collin's loss was felt the world over, with people from both sides of the Atlantic wighing in on the loss. Vermont and the world lost a true light. I believe one day there will be a world where our young men and women and everyone inbetween are no longer lost to this illness, where there's no more battling ones own body for breath. That's why I wish to book a show on October 25th, which is Collin's birthay. The event will be called ""lion's roar"", and the entire event will be a rememberance to Collin and others who have passed, and a call to attention to those still battling. 100% of the proceeds garnished from this show will go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation at the request of the Reynolds. We plan to hold the event at Higher Ground on 10/25/15. Rental for the space will be $1100 and that secures us the date. We may try to book a regional band that Collin would have liked if this gets enough money, but the main concern is securing the funds to rent the space. I set my goal at $2000 to make sure we have enough room incase anything pops up, but the go fund me makes more money than is needed ALL EXCESS FUNDS will go to CFF. If we can reach our goal is means on 10/25 we will have an event for everyone effected by CF to come together and celebrate, laugh, cry, and dance in the music community Collin loved so much, and with the costs covered 100% of the door money goes right to CF. So I ask you all, even if you didnt know Collin but support our brothers and sisters in Vermont music, if you're part of the Vermont punk/hardcore/metal scene like Collin was, If you knew or know anyone with CF, to donate what you can for this cause. Let's give him an amazing birthday, and let's spread hope to all those with birthday's coming up. Ryan Krushenick

                        A couple of years ago I found out that one of my childhood friends was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrigs Disease. This degenerative disease causes loss of muscle control which leads to many hardships and much needed assistance with all aspects of life.  I know that in the recent weeks much attention has been brought to ALS through the Ice Bucket Challenge which is a worthy cause and raises awareness. I decided to start this particular gofundme campaign in order to help my friend Jeff Fogel deal with his everyday challenges. Please donate any amount that you are able to, every penny counts. Thank You

~ 2015 is going to cost approximately $2309+ ~Sol House was thought up by a group of soulful house DJsin the spring of 2014. It was a simple concept in the beginning; to play Soulful, Classic, and Afro House at Lake Merritt for friends and family. What transpired the day of the event was something much more deep and connected to the community. What was planned for about 45 friends, ended up creating a family of over 500 people. All ages, all races, all creeds & genders ALL DANCING TOGETHER.Some of the Bay Areas best House DJ's donated their passion for the music and played for everyone that day.It was held on July 5th (Saturday) 2014 and we promised to come back July 4th (Saturday) 2015. Here's where YOU come in.Last year's event cost about $1500 to produce. Most of that money went on Taj's credit card (of which he is still paying off). This year's event is going to cost approximately $2309+. Taj ain't got that, folks...So we are asking for your help. If you can give $5 or $50 or even a random number like $3.57 or $35.70 we'd appreciate it. We set the goal low because we'd be happy with just any help, but the reality is that we truly need about $2309 + a little for the unforeseeables.All the DJ's involved donate their time and passion to play. We don't sell anything at the event. We give out free bottled water. This is event is truly about the music and we seek not to gain a penny. But it would be nice to not have to spend our own ""holiday savings"" to make it happen.Sol House 2015 HAS TO HAPPEN! Below is a list of our costs:Park Permit: $1005Rental Truck for Sound Equipment: $123Power Generator: $154Small Riser (stage): $75 < after partial sponsorshipEvent Banner: $75DJ Gear Rental (Mixer etc.): $5503 Porta Potties: $327Unforeseeables: $???The above items are our most basic needed items to make this year happen. Whatever you can do will help. We want you to know exactly where the money needed is going.

Hello, my name is DeAnna Young-Coleman and I'm asking for your help! Inmemory of my husband, Eric Andre Coleman (he passed away August 21st last year), I'm sponsoring a Family and Friends Day on Saturday, September 10th from 1-6pm at Willson Woods Park in Mount Vernon. It will consist of a free cookout, with free back to school haircuts and school supply giveaways.Eric was a paraprofessional at Edward Williams Elementary School. He also worked as a barber and used to give free back to school haircuts as a wayof giving back to the community. I want to continue his vision.I will use the money collected to pay for a child's haircut (we will give vouchers out to kids with parents, to use at a local barbershop),backpacks, school supplies and the cost of using the park.I would appreciate any contribution you can give to assist in making this day memorable and a success!!

                        Hello! I have recently been accepted to compete in the Miss Indiana USA pageant in October. I'm very excited to have this opportunity. However I know I cannot do this alone.Upon receiving my acceptance packet I received the due dates for my sponsorship money. $295 is due by August 1, 2016 and $450 is due by August 25th and another $450 by September 20th. The $295 is my deposit to secure my spot in the competition and I have $100 to start me off! The other $900 will go towards my pageant fees such as my hotel room for the pageant in Carmel, my food costs, and other fees associated with the pageant. Anything above the initial $1195 I would love to use for the pageant clothing which I have to provide. I am required to have an evening gown, a swimsuit, a cocktail dress, and nice casual clothing. If by a lovely happenstance I raise more than I expect I am planning to spread it through out charities such as FACE animal clinic and the Indianapolis Humane Society! I am very excited to have this opportunity and any help (including advice!) is welcome! Thank you! I'll look forward to posting updates!

Holiday Party For Children with SN,$230 ,$500 ,Events," August 4, 2016",7,1,SEVEN VALLEYS,PA,293000,,4,"

SEVEN VALLEYS, PA                                




I am extremely excited and looking forward to the 3rd annual Holiday Party December 10th, 2016 at Shrewsbury Volunteer Firehall! 


As many of you know, I have a child with special needs and had the idea to join together other families like mine in York County PA for support. It has surpassed my expectations and is now a great support group with over 250 families! It is a great way to seek advice, support and referrals. I have formed many treasured friendships and enjoy spending time with them. 


This year marks the 3rd year I will organize a holiday party with the help of great friends and family! My goal is to let our children have a party their way. With no limitaitons and worries, our children can express themselves in their own unique way and parents can relax and enjoy the day with families who understand. 


Since 2014, I am proud to say our group has grown exponentially from 60 to over 250 families! As in the past, my goal is to see that this party is just as fun and fabulous as the preious years. This year however, I need your help. Since we have grown so much, I am seeking friends and family who will help donate and spread the word so we can raise enough funds to cover food, small gifts, any venue fees, etc. I will donate any extra donations back to the community as I am also a huge believer in paying it forward! 


Please help us to continue to put these big beautiful smiles on the childrens faces and on the faces of their entire family! Seeing that, truly is the best gift to recieve for me and I hope, with your help, I can continue to do it!

The only obstacle I've been faced with is being able to get to New York and meet with the designer. It would mean so much to me if you could help out in any whatsoever. All of the money will be going towards my plane ticket+transportation once I get there. The other huge problem at hand is time. This designer wants to meet with me on January 27th to then walk on February 2nd. Yes. Of this year. This means that I pretty much have about 24 hours to come up with the money. I know how short notice this is but, again, it would mean so so sooo much to me if you all could help me make this happen. Thank you!

The Sacred Living Movement started with a book, a vision, and a dream. Now we're ready to move to the biggest part of that dream and we need your help!The Sacred Living Movement is raising moneyto fund a Retreat Center as a central home to all our Sacred programs. This vision for our retreat center includes a gorgeous space to hold live retreats in, beautiful farm land to support and sustain our community, and a tiny house village.

The retreat was designed to train visionary birth workers in her program and ideas for shifting the pregnancy + birth experience for women from medicalized to something sacred and honored. After the flagship retreat in Ojai, the movement grew into more programs and ideas and has become a grand vision that we now call The Sacred Living Movement.We quickly realized that all aspects of our life journey needed to be addressed, honored, marked and seen as SACREDand so we started developing programs to fit the needs of the communities we were servicing. Today we have traveled to over 9 different countries, trained well over 600 women to be Sacred Pregnancy Instructors and expanded who we are and who we want to be by including more programs that support living a truly SACRED LIFE. We now offer many live + online trainings that you can take to enhance your life and / or become certified in to either teach or offer direct services in your own communities.The Sacred Living Movement offers several beautiful programs for all walks of life including...Sacred Pregnancy(for all pregnant women)The Art of Sacred Postpartum(caring for postpartum women)Sacred Relationship(for all couples)Sacred Essence(natural family living)Sacred Medicine Woman(natural healing)Sacred Ayurveda(natural ayurvedic living)Sacred Doula(a doula certification program)Sacred Midwife(for midwives + birthassistants)Sacred Loss(healing loss + trauma)Sacred Yoga(a prenatal yoga certification program)Sacred Menopause(embracing ancient wisdom)Sacred Scent (essential oil classes)Sacred Beginnings(for mom + baby)I AM Sisterhood(breaking FREE to be ME)Sacred Sweeties Summer Camp(for girls + their moms)Sacred Sons(rasingstrongboys)Sacred Motherhood(embracing our natural role)Sacred Men(living passionate lives)Sacred Milk(feeding our children)Sacred Fertility(the path to creating families)Within these programs we offer several different classes and retreats, both liveand online.

This campaign is to raise money for a birthday surprise for a local boy named Ethan who has been having a tough year. Ethan is a fan of the show Supernatural and his mom would like to surprise him with a themed scavanager hunt where he will get to dress as a charater from the show, as well as get a ride in a real 67 Chevy Impala.Two wonderful friends of mine named Jimmy and Kim own a beloved car known as Thor, a perfect replica of the car Baby used on the show. Jimmy and Kim are willing to make the long drive from Rochester NY to Brunswik ME (Over 500 miles) to help give Ethan the best birthday surprise ever.What we are asking for is donations to cover the cost of gas to bring Thor to Maine, a hotel for the night for Jimmy and Kim, and loads of presents for the birthday boy!Ethans mom would like to have this set up for around August 6th so we would like to reach our goal by mid July.Also I intend to make a large birthday card and sign the names of all donors (Unless you would like otherwise)The local news had done two stories which have since been taking down, but we do have a video from them to share! http://www.wcsh6.com/news/outreach/birthday-surprise-attracts-supernatural-help/199605337

If you would like to read more about Thor The Impala check out Jimmy and Kim's website here: http://www.experienceentertainment.net/There is also a PO Box set up to receive cards and small gifts for Ethan. Ethan Landry PO Box 495 Brunswick, ME 04011-0495

TELLURIDE, CO                                





                        Colorado's San Miguel County intends to host an Indigenous Peoples Day on Oct. 8, 2016.We are trying to raise money to pay for Ute and Anglo speakers to come to Telluride's Sheridan Opera House in the evening, to have a small ceremony in the afternoon in the Mountain Village Plaza and to hold a dedication in the morning for a new plaque in Placerville to the Ute people (Nuche) who were unjustly removed from Western Colorado in 1881 (a monument similar to the one the Town of Ophir dedicated several years ago as pictured above). In 2012 Native American legal scholar Walter R. Echo-Hawk gave the keynote speech at the Center of the American Wests The Nation Possessed conference at the University of Colorado in Boulder in which he said America would never be at peace until it reconciled with the indigenous peoples of this land who had been dispossessed in the creation of this nation. He explained that reconciliation had five parts: the precipitating incident, an apology, acceptance of the apology, some kind of restitution and eventually reconciliation. In 2014 -- working with Roland McCook, former tribal chair of the Ute Indian Tribe and a descendant of the Uncompahgre Nuche band -- San Miguel County adopted a resolution formerly apologizing to the Uncompahgre Utes for their removal from county lands over 130 years earlier. In 2015 Roland and San Miguel County Commissioner Art Goodtimes presented the resolution at the tribal headquarters of the Ute Indian Tribe in Fort Duchesne, Utah. The apology was accepted by descendants of the Uncompahgre Utes who attended the presentation; and an acceptance story and photo was published in the Ute Bulletin.To continue this process of reconciliation, Roland and San Miguel County want to educate local citizens, hear from Nuche people about past and present issues, and explore together how to continue this process of reconciliation.San Miguel County has allocated $5000 in seed money, and the Town of Mountain Village has pledged up to $5000 as well. We are seeking up to $5000 from the Town of Telluride and hope to raise another $5000 in donations to make our projected budget of $20,000.

Marina to Rotary!,"$3,284 ","$5,600 ",Events," September 23, 2015",46,12,LYNN,MA,278000,1,7,"






                             
                            
                            
                                                           
LYNN, MA                                





                        Hi! My name is Marina Bogdanova, I am turning 15 on Novemmber 19, 2015, and I love animals. I was in a fire when I was only almost 2 years old. It was a house fire, and I don't know much about it, except that I was sleeping. My Mom told me that the burns were major, about 67% if I remember correctly. Doctors say I was lucky to survive. I started getting surgeries right away, everyday at first to cover my body with skin, and then less and less. I now get sugeries 1-2 times a year, and I still need many more years of them. I am also very shy when it comes to meeting new people, and/or trying something new. This summer though, my school recomended me to an overenight summer camp for a week, called Camp Rotary, in Boxford, Massachusets. I thought about it, and finaly said to myself, ""Why not? I can't just hide myself from the world all the time, doing the same things over and over again every day. Plus there was probably a reason my school suggested me, right?"" And so I ended up going to camp. I really liked it from the second I got there. I loved the friendly counselors and campers, who were always cheerful and supportive. I loved the activities they offered. I loved the feeling of a small village-like community settled somewhere in the middle of the woods, separated from the rest of the world. I loved that no one judged you by your appearance, and the things that you can or cannot do. It felt like a home.  Normaly, when I hear music in a place where there are people, even if that is my favorite song, the maximum movement I'd make would be tapping my hand, finger, foot, or all three together to the beet of the music. There, though, I was dancing, and singing, and actualy communicating with people! I think there was something in the air..  I also met a very special to me person, who expained to me how to play varios games, and encouraged me to make my first, second and third dive into the water, which I would have never done myself. With his support, I even jumped off a tower 10 feet abouve water!! Also, on Thursday night, when the camp dance is happening, he was the first ever person I slow danced with.. Anyway, camp was supper fun, exciting, and full of memmories. I realy hope to be able to go next summer.  The reason why it costs so much is because it costs $700 per week, and it runs for nine weeks of the summer. I am trying to find a job to help me get this amount of money, but so far I am unsuccessful. If you worry that this is too much time without seeing my family, don't worry! At this camp, campers that stay for more than one week in a row get to see there parents and go home from Saturday morning and come back Sunday just before lunch. I hope to get into at least four weeks of camp.Although phones are not allowed, campers and their family and friends can communicate with them through letters and packages. I really want to go there for the whole summer next year, and I really hope as manny of my readers as possible will donate for my cause, and help me enjoy the fantastic feeling of a place were I belong next year. Pluss, all extra money will be saved for upcoming surgeries, which wiil cost a fortune.Thank you very much to all, and God Bless You!! <3

Camp Rainman 2016,"$1,325 ","$10,000 ",Events," March 5, 2015",21,19,BOSSIER CITY,LA,282000,1,9,"






                            Alice Reynolds
                            
                            
                                                           
BOSSIER CITY, LA                                





                        Camp Rainman has been serving individuals with Autism and their families for almost 30 years! It has grown from a hand full of students to 50-75 and its a costly event. For those of you who don't know what Camp Rainman is:It is a camp for persons with autism, ages 10 & up. We have a one on one ratio with campers and counselors. WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT THAN OTHER CAMPS? Its sole purpose is to provide an environment for persons with autism to be themselves without reprisal or approval from others and to have fun from morning until night. WHAT ARE THE ACTIVITIES AT CAMP RAINMAN? Swimming, fishing, rock climbing, hiking, crafts, putt putt golf, movies, singing and dancing and more. Each year offers a unique experience designed around a camp theme. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN DOING THIS? We are in our twenty ninth year! HOW LONG IS CAMP RAINMAN AND WHAT ARE THIS YEARS DATES? Camp Rainman starts June 13th at 12pm and ends June 16th at 12pm .WHERE IS CAMP RAINMAN? This years camp is being held at Clara Springs Campsite in Pelican La. We will provide transportation to and from the campsite from Bossier City. Family cabins are available for members that would like to stay close by. HOW IS CAMP RAINMAN FUNDED AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? Camp is funded primarily by donations. There is a camp registration fee of $125.00 asked of our camp families but no one is turned away due to cost, the camp covers any fees for families that cannot make this. Each camper needs a counselor and we need between 10-15 staff to manage the camp. Each person at camp will cost 45 $ a day so the cost per camper is actually over $300. We need about $15,000 for one camp session. Camp leaders hold fundraisers and events all year to make this goal but for most of our families , getting away from the family to attend a fundraiser is very difficult. Won't you help us make our goal?  29 Years ago Camp Rainman had their first camp out. It started with one small classroom. When I took over camp, we had 20 campers . I fell in love with camp and knew my mission would be to make it available to more people . I hated turning people away because we didn't have the funds. I knew how special this camp was. Since then, we have between 50-75 campers every year and every camp has been just as special as the first one. We know this camp is blessed. Our kids look forward to this camp all year.For many of our kids they become shut out of the world as they age. Some require so much support that it is not always possible to get that support in day to day life so camp is a great reprieve from that. Our mission has always been to push the limits at camp giving our kids the experience they otherwise would not be able to get anywhere. We want to make their experience for these few days so awesome that it matches their anticipation and gives them memory gifts to carry with them all year. Thank YouAlice Reynolds, Camp Co-chairman and mother to Gabe, 24 yrs old.

Get Tyler to summer camp!,"$2,625 ","$3,600 ",Events," March 29, 2016",51,5,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,280000,1,2,"

                        Tyler is a very sweet, silly, loving 11 year old. At 2 years old Tyler was diagnosed with severe autism and is 100% nonverbal. During the school year Tyler enjoys school and works hard. But in the summer he struggles because there is very little that he can do. He is too severely affected to successfully fit into most summer activities. He has been on the waiting list to receive services for 6 years. Last year however, he was fortunate to receive a one-time respite funding through the state of Utah for individuals on the wait list to attend a specialized day camp during the summer. Volunteers at this camp have experience and training in helping children and teens with limitations similar to Tylers. It was the best summer of his life. For the first time, he had friends. He was able to participate in activities that hes never been successful at before. He was able to stay active. It was the happiest summer hes ever had. This year, due to lack of financing, he is facing another lonely and difficult summer. Returning to summer camp would be a great blessing and joy for him and provide meaningful social, emotional, and recreational activities.Here is a link to the program.  http://turncommunityservices.org/summer-adventures-in-salt-lake/

Jordan Haynes's Birthday Gift,"$1,078 ","$1,000 ",Events," August 16, 2016",33,1,LOUISVILLE,KY,281000,,2,"

LOUISVILLE, KY                                





                        I've known Jordan Haynes for over 10 years. I first met him when our bands (Subrosa and disco.) played together asteenagers.I remember back then being in awe of how good he was.10 years later, I'm even more in awe of how good he is. Not just as a talented musician or an incredible producer, but how good of a person he is.If you know Jordan, you know that he is hard-working, reliable, friendly, and cares just as much about your music as his does his own. He always supports the bands he works with and doesn't ask for anything in return.We're lucky as a community to have someone like Jordan who can bring out the best in all of us fellow musicians.For the past year, my band Light Treasonshas been writing and recording an album with Jordan 1-2 songs at a time. It's been great creatively, but is much more workto do it this way. Idecided that I wanted to do a little something extra for Jordan for all the hard work he's been putting in. He mentioned to me that he wanted to get a new keyboard for his ProTools rig(his current one is completely worn out). I figuredI could get a couple people to pitch in on that. Then I thought, what about all the bands he's recorded over the years? If we call came together and threw in tiny bits of money, we could give Jordan an amazing birthday and the studio some major upgrades!So that's the plan. His 28th birthday is 9/3/16 (also the date of the Artifex Pereo album release show!) and I want to give him a huge hug and an even bigger gift from the musicians he's helped over the years.Will you join me?P.S. Since Jordan is turning 28, I'd suggest donating $28 if you can afford to!P.P.S. The $1,000 goal is arbitrary. Any and all money from this campaign will go directly to Jordan to let him buy any upgrades he wants for his studio. Let's try to getit over $1,000!

                        Pretty Girlz Rock. PGR Annual Retreat is a non- profit organization geared towards young girls ages 11  17 to help them through the growing pains of life as they mature. We want to help them to understand the gifts and talents they have been blessed with, without compromise.     In addition, PGR supports recovery of all types such as different types of abuse and/or addiction. We aim to provide young girls with a heads up by equipping them with the knowledge they need to successfully function in todays society.      Ultimately, our goal is that this event will be FREE for each girl and have the young ladies that complete the retreat recommend it to someone else due to the positive influence it has made in their own personal lives. This annual retreat is designed to aid middle to high school age girls and prepare each of them for the upcoming year as well as what may lie ahead in life. We hope to see your daughter there.

"2nd Annual ""Shore For A Cure"" Skate","$3,620 ","$3,500 ",Events," July 9, 2015",60,14,MOORESTOWN,NJ,269000,1,4,"

MOORESTOWN, NJ                                




The Goal Our goal is to raise money and awareness of the camp that Chaz attends, but will not be able to attend this summer. Also for the recent loss of our beloved Aunt Vick, who was a mother to us all. We will be donating 50/50 to both Camp No Worries and to The LiveSTRONG foundation The Reasons We have lost enough people and know enough of strong-willed people who are more than worthy of receiving the help they deserve. By doing this Skate, we can promote awareness of the importance of physical activity and staying fit, while raising money for a cure.  The kids that Chaz works with every summer have been nothing short of inspiring. Our Aunt Vick was the same way, teaching us to live life the way you want it to be lived. You only get one shot, so why not make it worthwhile? But also, why not help out the ones who are less fortunate? That is where we come in. We hope to inspire others to get active, give back, and smile by doing this skate and continue to pass the inspiration on.  We have all lost someone to this epidemic. We will lose more. We are working towards the cure.Camp No Worries  ""Upon first look at the campers who attend Camp No Worries, you would not think there is anything unique about them. However, Camp No Worries campers are all children dealing with a diagnosis of cancer in some way. They are patients, survivors, siblings, or bereaved siblings ranging in age six to sixteen. Camp No Worries strongly believes there is a therapeutic component of including brother and sisters in the camping experience. Therefore, we do not limit the number of siblings that attend, as long as they meet the minimal requirements. Camp No Worries is a summer camp created solely to give children with cancer and their siblings an opportunity to relax, enjoy themselves and forget about their worries for one week every summer. Its a place that allows children facing a diagnosis of cancer to just be kids. Its a place of happiness, friendship and new adventures. Its a place of camaraderie and acceptance where everyone knows firsthand what its like to live with cancer. And, its a true summer camp experience in every sense of the word.""

                        Hello to all my South LewisBrothers, and Sisters!! It's hard to believe, but it has been over 5 years already, since we got together on that beautiful dayin the Lyons Falls Park(August 2010). I am very happy to announce thatIT'S TIME TO FIRE IT UP AGAIN!!!:)Time for The South Lewis Multi Year Get Together (Part 2). Because it was such a great success, the event willbe much like the last, except for a few changes.The biggest change isin the ""Entertainment"". In 2010, i made it a point to havethe majorityof our entertainment (Music and Comedy) be provided by actual SL Alumni. It was a complete success, as we were blessed to have a few Classmates donate their time to entertain us, with their wonderfultalents. They were all amazing!! I have decided that this time, i want those people, and EVERYONE to be able to just show up, sit back, and enjoy the day....without any worries at all.No strings attached!! Just a relaxing day of catching up to all those great friends/classmates, enjoying food, drinks, and reminiscing!! :) And so,i have made the decision to hire an absolutely amazing band to ROCK OUR SOX for a few hours in the park. (Saturday 2pm-6pm) Based on the feedback i have received, from many who said theywere willing tocontribute, and the likelihood of another great turnout, iknow it won't be a problem to raisethe money to cover the bands fees. The goal is set to cover $1,200 for the band, and the other $200.00 will cover the fees charged by ""GoFundMe"", and ""We Pay"" for the their services, in running this campaign. If the generous donations continue beyond our goal, i will use the money as you all see fit. You will be able to see where we stand, as we go along. Thank you advance, and i am excited to be seeing all my Falcon Friends/Classmates real soon. Dave Martin'82

Remember when it ACTUALLY HAPPENED?Well, we're doing it again...Asheville style. The 2016 Cyclocross National Championships are being hosted in Asheville, North Carolina, and we want to party. Most importantly, we want to raise money for a super rad organization called Trips for Kids of Western North Carolina. If you came to the NCCX End of the Season Bash this past 'cross season, you saw first hand how amazing our cycling community is. We were able to raise $1000 in just a few short hours!If you've ever organized a fundraiser, you know it doesn't come cheap. We put on the NCCX bash with no budget. The cycling community came together and made it happen through donations and sacrifice. The 2016 Asheville Foam Party will host racers and spectators from all over the country, and we have big goals and even bigger shoes to fill.Please consider donating to a worthy cause. Yes, we're throwing a massive party, but we've also got some other tricks up our sleeves. We'll have prizes, DJs, and good company. Did we mention beer? Yeah, we'll have that, too.Donations to our gofundme will go directly to event planning and execution. If there are remaining funds, they will be awarded to Trips for Kids of WNC.All proceeds from the party will go to Trips for Kids of WNC. Kids on bikes...what's cooler than that?

2016 NDOR Walk A Mile for Survivors,"$5,367 ","$3,000 ",Events," August 5, 2015",32,13,BOWIE,MD,149000,,6,"

BOWIE, MD                                





                        Our Story We are preparing for our 4th Annual Walk a Mile, in honor of Murdered Victims, on September 25, 2016. September 25th of each year is the day that Congress mandated as the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims. We are grateful to the Office of Victims of Crime, National Parents of Murdered Children, and Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center for making this happen, and getting this legislation passed in 2007.  My story is really our story, mine and the many others who have walked in my shoes. My daughter Stacey Lynne Seaton was murdered June 1, 2005, and since that day, I have traveled a journey that has been both difficult and long. As I reflect back over the past ten years, I realize how my life has dramatically changed, as much for the better, as it has been for the worse. Nothing can take away the pain of either my daughter's murder, or our family's journey through the justice system, but I have been able to pick myself up and continue moving forward. It has not been easy, and I have not done it alone. Along my journey, I have met many wonderful champions of justice, and even more friends, who have also survived the loss of a loved one to violence. It is life changing, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Unfortunately we all have to find our ""new normal"" and try to move forward, and it is far from easy.  As a marathon runner, I knew that running would help me on the road to recovery. I share this because, surprisingly, it took me a month after Stacey was murdered to even run a mile (without tripping). So I believe that if you can get up and walk a mile, you can keep moving forward. Walking is therapeutic and you don't have to do it alone. At this year's Walk A Mile, many will be walking with us. Survivors of Homicide, law enforcement officers, friends, fire fighters, community members, first responders and victims' advocates. This year, we expect over 150 people walking with us. As we walk a Mile through Bowie, this September 25th, we encourage you to walk with us. After we walk, we will hold a candle light vigil, and then have a picnic, and give away donated gifts - to include a weekend away in Ocean City, a year's free membership to a fitness center, and many gift certificates to local diners. Both our event and environment is informal, we encourage you to get to know one another. I'm blessed to be a long distance runner, as I find running to be healing. Running did not come quickly to me on June 2nd 2005 , the ""day after"", but I prayed to God that I would again run like I used to. I tried again the next day and the next. It took me a whole month, but I made it a mile without tripping. Walk a Mile in My Shoes was started in 2012, by volunteer Survivors and Victim Advocates, to both celebrate the National Day of Remembrance of Murder Victims, and to encourage others to walk that mile, and keep moving forward. Please join us on September 25th, for our 4th National Day of Remembrance ceremony, at Allen Pond, in Bowie, MD - a beautiful place that provides healing and serenity, to honor our loved ones lost to violence. We will be walking a mile into the neighborhood, and we invite you to walk with us and light a candle in memory of a loved one lost to violence.  If you can not make it, please consider donating. Receipts will be provided for items purchased with your contribution. For any contribution of $150 or more, your name or organization will be printed on our shirts.  We rely on the generosity of our family and friends to provide for a successful event, as this event has helped many of us move forward. All funds go towards paying for the picnic location, food, t-shirts, and items supporting the picnic, and transportation for Survivors. All excess funds received will go toward providing emergency funds to a family of a homicide survivor in need (ie., funeral expenses not covered by insurance, counseling, transportation to court, housing, etc).

                        Help needed!! My friend Renee opened an incredible store in Sherman Oaks called Earthbaby boutique. It's seriously the cutest store with a class space, and every time I go there I learn something and pick up a cool, unique find.Her store was BROKEN INTO last night. She found out when the LAPD called her, thankfully someone walking by saw the smashed window and called the police.But almost everything was taken. From her registers, to her computer, ipads, baby carriers and diapers bags, they targeted the high value merchandise.Renee has insurance, but she has a $3,000 deductible and insurance often won't cover the full price of items. She had to pay for her door to be boarded up, and will need a new glass dooe this week.I want to rally behind Renee and show her some love. WHO ROBS A BABY STORE?Renee is such a giving, loving person. She often throws free events, provides babywearing and lactation support, mommy and me yoga classes and so much more.Her store has the most unique baby carriers. She introduced me to Tulababy carriers before they became super trendy, and she works with really small local businesses to help grow and expand their reach.Please support Renee. Anything you can do helps.We plan to host an event in-store soon and invite ALL of you to come in, shop, mingle and show whoever did this what a great community Renee is part of, and just how important her small boutique is to parents in LA.

This May, Kofi will be celebrating his 30th birthday and travelling to Accra, Ghana, his place of birth and home to not only our family but the Mmofra Children's Park. This park,a wonderful green space located in the heart of the capital and the brainchild of our grandmother, Efua T. Sutherland, and her children (Esi, Ralph, and our mother Amowi), brings people of all ages together in an urban garden and park which brings educational opportunities (like our community garden and outdoor library) and much needed public green space to the city.Kofi, and in fact all our lives, have been forever forged by the foundation and the park, and we want to bring this wonderful space to as many as we can. Unfortunately, the accessibility of most urban areas remains poor for people with disabilities, and we want to make sure everyone can come and enjoy this eden in the city. With your help and donations, we plan onenhancing the park's existing walkways and exhibits to make sure anyone with special needs feels at home in ours.We are looking to raise $3,000.00 by May 28 (the day Kofi departs for Accra). We accept any and all donations, and in honor of this big birthday celebration, we encouragedonations in multiples of 3 ($15, $27, $33, etc.). Thank you so much for contributing to our family's dream, and if you have any questions please feel free to email us at formmofra@gmail.comLove,Kofi, Rachel, and Kwesi Phillips

FORT WORTH, TX                                




My name is Charisse Mathis. Recently, I founded a non-profit organization named Teach Love Not Hate. The goal of the organization is to foster positive relationships between Law Enforcement and our community. With all that has taken place over the country the last couple of months, in addition to all of the unrest and tension between Law Enforcement and citizens, a couple of friends and I (who are also mothers like myself) knew something had to be done. On August 20th 2016, we hosted a Back-To-School rally at Worth Heights Community Center. We contacted a couple of officers that We knew and they graciously donated their time and came out to interact with the children as well as their parents. The event was a big success and gave children the opportunity to see Law Enforcement in a positive light. In addition, we were able to provide almost 200 families with back to school supplies, backpacks and clothes.Weare currently planning a Fall Festival, which will take place on October 22nd at Worth Heights Community Center from 6pm until 9pm. We are reaching out to local businesses for donations and to come out and have fun with the community. If you have any questions or concerns please let me know. Below is the link to the news coverage from the event. I hope to hear from you soon. If you would like to contact Teach Love Not Hate please email us at Teachlovenothate@yahoo.com. Have a very wonderful day.

We had our first African-American Nominee in 2008 and now we have our first female Presidential Nominee of a major political party, Hillary Rodham Clinton. She will make a great president. So proud to have been a part of Herstory for more than 40 years.I first encountered Mrs. Clinton back in the 1970s when I worked for The National Black Child Development Institute in Washington, D. C. and she was a young lawyer with The Children Defense Fund (CDF) across town. Her work at CDF was known throughout the child advocacy world. Over the years, our work crossed paths through her leadership on the National Board of The Legal Services Corporation and her active role as First Lady during The Clinton Administration. I worked on a Working Group that did the research for the USDA Transition Team that lead to the creation of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Program.

Send Awesome 5th Graders to Camp!,"$1,205 ",$750 ,Events," March 21, 2016",45,6,PROVO,UT,229000,,2,"

                        Ezra is in 5th grade, and goes to school in Provo, Utah. Each summer, the 5th graders in his neighborhood are given the chance to spend a week at Camp Big Spring. This is that one trip in elementary school that all the kids look forward to; the one they seem to remember years later as being the best summer ever.Well, for the kids that can afford to go, that is.We live in a neighborhood with a lot of amazing families, and a lot of economic hardship. Many of Ezra's closest friends come from homes where both mom and dad need to work just to make ends meet. Coming up with the $120 camp fee is a luxury they just can't swing.Ezra'sfolks were able to help a few of his friends, but not all of them. This broke Ezra's heart. He decided to reach out to anyone else who might be able to help. That's you! Here's what Ezra is asking:* If you can stand to part with a few bucks, please donate to this cause! Every dollar will go towards helping one of a numberof students in his class who can't afford to go to camp. The more we raise, the more kids we can help!* There are parents who can pay a part of the fee. Your donations will help offset that cost, and in turn help these well-meaning parents provide a positive, meaningful experience for their kids.* The money needs to be turned in to the school by FRIDAY, MARCH 25TH! That means we need to raise as much as possible by this THURSDAY! Spread the word!Ezra is right: to a 5th grader, summer camp is a HUGE deal! Imagine how grateful these families will be to know that total strangers care enough about creating meaningful experiences for their kids to donate money to help them out. There's massive satisfaction in that, folks!You rock! Let's do this!!

I am now funded in full. Thank you all!I'm an elected Sen Bernie Sanders Supporter and needs help with costs to attend and participate in the Denocratic National Convention, as a member of the Credentials Committee and Ct convention floor whip for the campaign.I have been elected as a member of The Credentials Committee for the Democratic National Convention representing Connecticut and am pledged to support Sen Bernie Sanders. As a committee member I have to be in Philadelphia two nights early and without a roommate for the two or three nights - that means my expenses are higher then most delegates by about $800- $1,200. Though I have saved some money towards the expenses, I have recently had my income reduced by 1/3 due to loss of consulting contract and cut back on a second job which wipes out any of my discretionary income.As Clerk of the Connecticut House I cannot except contributions from members and staff of the Connecticut legislature or any registered lobbiests (state or Federal) or state employees doing regular business with the legislature or corporations per state ethic code and federal election law. But always appreciate everybody's good wishes.

                        Every year, TEMA Foundation along with the West Indian Community of Central Florida comes together to celebrate good over evil, in the form of Diwali: Festival Of Lights. This year, October 22, 2016, we're bringing the yearly festivities once again to Kissimmee Lakefront Park. Free to the entire community along with free parking and free refreshments to those in attendance. But as usual, we'll need help from our friends & families to make this possible. And, that's where you come in. Yes you, reading this. Everything that comes into play to make this event special costs money. And we will be needing at least $7,000 to pull this off the right way. Now, don't get any ideas, but 100% of ALL PROFITS will benefit TEMA FOUNDATION and the Diwali Celebration. None will be pocketed for personal use. Along with your contribution, you have the option to be recognized if you are a business or company owner. This event has been one of the biggest in Central Florida over the years, and as the crowd grows, so do the expenses. Come together and let's help out for one of the most brightest Celebrations of Lights, Diwali. For more information, contact Raj at 321-324-1285 or Devin at 407-803-9992.

My son Kristopher has always wanted to be in the military, he participated in the Naval JROTC classes that his high school offered from 9th thru 12th grades, so I always knew this would be the direction he would take in life. So, when at 17 he came to me and said it was time to see a recruiter I was ready. He enlisted March of this year, 2016, he graduated from Picayune Memorial High School in May '16 and then we waited for his departure date. He left August 22, 2016 and began his SIT (soldier in training) journey at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. I'm so proud of my son and the choice he has made. As a single mother we want the best for our children and it can be a struggle. Prior to graduation day there is a Family Day, where the families can spend the day with their soldier. My son will be graduating from boot camp on November 3,2016 and family day is the day before on November 2nd, I'm so excited and want so badly to be able to attend but finances are tight and my car needs new tires and a tune up to be road worthy. I'm blessed to work everyday but know that my income will not allow for me to make this trip without help. It would be a blessing to receive any help with my trip. To get to see my son achieve his dream and move on to the phase of his journey is my prayer and my goal. Thanking God in advance for any and all blessings.

                        A few months ago, Jazz asked his daddy to teach him how to play chess. He quickly fell in love, and began playing in tournaments--four to date. He playsat two local library's chess clubs, but the amount of teaching either of those do is limited, and his district does not have any school chess teams. As his birthday approaches, we'd like you to know that Jazz has more than enough toys, clothes, and books. (Seriously. MORE than enough). If you are consider giving him a gift, please consider contributing to this fund. Your gift could send him to a tournament. (He's been begging to go to one that lasts more than one day, AND where he gets to stay in a hotel). It could send him to chess camp. (Completely out of our budget). It could pay for a private lesson to help him develop his technique, strategy, and critical thinking skills. Studies show we derive more pleasure from experiences than things. Consider gifting Jazz an unforgettable experience.

                        My name is Sherry Quick-Durst and I am Kimberly Parson's cousin. I want to help her make it to  the National Convention  for Amputees Coalition in  Tuscon, Arizona. This conference is geared toward helping amputee's with strategies for ways to deal with their conditions, much needed networking with specialists and others with similar conditions and learning of  the newest technology. For those that don't know, Kim is a quad amputee. She survived sepsis but not before it took all of her limbs. She has continued with a positvie attitude that continues to inspire many. With all she has been through learning these skills would mean so much to her and helping her with raising her 3 young  children. I have done an estimate of what the costs would befor her to attend with a caregiver and the high end cost is $4500.00 and low end is $3600.00.  This covers hotel, airfare, meals and incidentals. If we surpass our goal amount we will put the money with Kim to  add to her better prosthetics fund and for other things to make her life easier and more adaptable for amputees  (i.e. a bidet-something  most of us would not think of as a necessity). Here is a link to a news story done on her: 
http://www.wowktv.com/story/23489865/putnam-county-wv-woman-loses-limbs-to-staph-infection-shares-storyYou can also follow her on her Facebook page: Kimmy's Care
I pray that you help me in this endeavor to give this young amazing woman a chance to go on this trip and possibly even donate toward better prosthetics.  Feel free to contact me with any questions. God Bless and please feel free to share this. Let's make this a reality!

Here it is, Ethan's Birthday Fundraising time again! Thanks to all of our family, friends and neighbors for your help over the past 3 years of Ethans fundraising efforts! *In 2012 there was terrible flooding and the Lake Superior Zoo suffered a great loss of animals and properties. Ethan was able to raise $1200 that went directly to the zoo for their rebuilding campaign. *In 2013 his interest peaked in the Giraffe Exhibit at our own backyard Zoo and he was able to raise $1100 that went directly to the Como Zoo Giraffe exhibit. *In 2014 frogs were the theme and the MN Herpetological Society benefitted from his donation of $750 that will help in the study of frogs, toads, turtles and snakes. This year he has decided that he would like to help a K-9 for the SPPD to be outfitted with a protective vest. Ethan loves dogs and is a great dog owner- Rocco is very lucky. This decision comes after a visit during a Cub Scout meeting by Officer Jay Curiel and his K-9 Havoc (and after about a million questions). Ethan thanks you in advance for any donation you wish to make to the SPPD K-9 Foundation and he hopes you share his passion to keep our four legged officers safe!Kindest regards,Ethan's MomAll monies raised will be delivered to the SPPD K9 Foundation in fall and we will post lots of photos. http://www.stpaulpolicek-9foundation.org

Alyssa's AXO Page Dream,"$1,490 ","$1,000 ",Events," April 13, 2016",39,5,HIGH POINT,NC,207000,,,"






                            Alyssa Karim
                            
                            
                                                           
HIGH POINT, NC                                





                        My name is Alyssa Karim, and I am currently a junior enrolled at High Point University. I am also a member of the Kappa Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega.As a sister of Alpha Chi Omega, my life has been impacted in some of the most positive, incredible ways these past three years.For those of you that do not know, my mother, Susan Karim (nee Kesl) was a sister of Alpha Chi Omega at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. A very involved chapter member, she was Active of the Semester in 1984, she received many honors for ritual and her academics through the chapter, and she was also a Page for the 1985 National Convention. For those not involved with Alpha Chi Omega, a Convention Page is a prestigous position that one may apply for as a collegiate member of Alpha Chi. At Convention there are many duties that a Page serves - a host for sisters of all ages, a source of information and communication for those in attendance, the opportunity to attend various educational and leadership workshops, and much more.My mom saved everything from her time as a collegiate member of Alpha Chi Omega - her bond card, letters that sisters wrote her the night of her initiation, newspaper clippings, letters and notes she jotted down for herself, and most notably - her memorabilia from Convention, including her sash from being a Convention Page.This year, I had the chance to apply for that same position my mom held at Convention in 1985. I have now heard back and have been given the incredible opportunity to be a Convention Page - one of 12 selescted in the nation, just like my mom - the greatest role model and best friend I have ever had.I love Alpha Chi Omega with all of my heart, and much of that I owe to my mom. I have always wanted to be just like her, and if I can be half the woman she was, I will have lived a successful an fulfilling life.Since my mom passed away two years ago, for the most part I have been self-sustained aside from my tuition. I am lucky to have a job as a Resident Assistant on High Point's campus, however the income from this is minimal and is unfortunately not enough to cover the registration fees, travel, and accomodations for Convention. Any money raised will go straight towards Convention fees ($475), hotel accomodations ($209), shuttle costs (to and from the airport $58), and airfare (approximately $300-350 to get to Orlando) - in total this all adds up to approximately $1000.To have the opportunity to attend this years 59th National Convention this June and serve as a Page would be an honor, for both myself and to my mom's legacy. I would be so thankful for any support, and appreciate you all taking the time to read this.

                        Hello family & friends!I have recently decided to compete for the title of Miss North Dakota USA 2017! This event is to be held on November 19-20, 2016 in Fargo, ND. After placing 2nd Runner Up at the State Preliminary Pageant last year I decided I need to do everything I can to make my dream a reality this year and I am so excited!I am so grateful for all that pageantry has taught me. I first competed in the The Miss Universe Organization at the age of 16. I continue to choose this organization as it empowers women to develop the confidence they need to achieve their personal best. A confident woman has the power to make real change, starting in her local community with the potential to reach a global audience. The organization encourages every woman to get out of her comfort zone, be herself, and continue to define what it means to be Confidently Beautiful.This is an awesome opportunity to be involved with a pageant system that emphasizes their tradition of spotlighting positive role models for todays young women and I am honored to represent my family, friends, and the city of Fargo. I am currently looking for potential sponsors willing to help finance the associated fees. The funds raised will go towards the admission fee to compete, wardrobe, personal training and various other preparations. Competing at Miss USA has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl and I cannot express how much your love & support has meant to me in my journey thus far. If you are unable to donate, please leave your well wishes and prayers. Every contribution is appreciated so much.If you have any questions or would like to know more about my journey to Miss North Dakota USA please contact me.XOXO,Jenna

BENefit for the NBHS Marching Band,$210 ,$500 ,Events," May 14, 2014",7,28,NEW BRITAIN,CT,155000,1,3,"

NEW BRITAIN, CT                                





                        This annual fundraiser to benefit the New Britain High School Golden Hurricanes Marching Band is held to honor the memory of Bennett Clark Cheney, Drill Sergeant, NBHS Class of 2008.When Ben was killed in a car accident in February 2012 at the age of 21, all Memorial donations were directed to the Marching Band, in recognition of the love and dedication Ben had for the organization. In 2012, with memorial donations, the sale of ""ben"" bracelets, and a well-attended pasta dinner, we raised $20,000. Since there is no community-wide fundraiser for the band - a source of pride for the City of New Britain - we decided to hold an annual event. Since then, a total of $40,000 has raised and donated to the band.The 5th AnnualBENefit is scheduled for Saturday, September 12, at Trinity-on-Main in downtown New Britain. We hope many of you will attend, but as time goes on, more and more of Ben's friends and classmates have moved away. In addition, we want those who have an appreciation for the Golden Hurricanes Marching Band - either from having been part of the Band at some point in it's 81-year history, or who simply remember the excitement of watching them perform at countless football games and parades - to be able to make a donation, large or small, from your home - no matter where it might be.Arts programs are squeezed tighter and tighter every year. The need for instruments, uniforms, repairs, and all the incidentals never ends, and become more expesive each year. In an urban community, these cannot always be borne by the students. An entusiastic band member should never be turned away because he/she can't afford an instrument, or to repair an instrument. Better instruments contribute to a better sound; more instruments contribute to a bigger band. The fund raised in Ben's name will ensure that the Golden Hurricanes will continue to be a source of pride for generations past, present, and future.

                        We are Jing Mo Tong Athletic Association. We're a newly formed lion dance and kung fu non-profit organization looking for funds to send some of our members to Milwaukee, WI for kung fu training and lion dance exchanges at The Shaolin Center of Wukesha on Oct. 16th-19th, 2015. Also, there will be special guest, Mark Vuong , from Houston, TX in attendance to teach high level martial arts and lion dance. Also, if we can't raise enough to send members, any money raised will be allocated towards much needed equipment. Please support and help us to further our knowledge worth sharing with the community.UPDATE: The campaign has been updated to send members of our team for kung fu training Milwaukee, WI at The Shaolin Center of Waukesha on Oct. 16th-19th, 2015. We also be getting some high level lion dance and kung fu training from special guest, Mark Vuong. He wil be coming from Houston, TX. We appreciate all the support we have recieved so far. Thanks.About UsWe are a group that gather to practice once or twice a week. The age within the group ranges from 14-35. But kung fu and lion dance is not limited with age. We have an open door policy and offer free lessons to the general public. We do lion dance performances and kung fu demonstrations as often as our scheduling allows.Director, Ray PetersenDeputy Director, Anh NguyenOur director, Ray Petersen and deputy director, Anh Nguyen, both got theirstart in Chinese martial arts and lion dancing through the LPS Chinese language program, headed by Celine Robertson. Celine's love of Chinese martial arts and lion Dancing was passed on to them via their involvement in her Chinese classes. Being a key part of their martial development, she was even responsible for sending director Petersen to Taiwan to further his training.About Lion DancingThe lion dance has been part of the Chinese culture for thousands of years and is performed on auspicious occasions such as weddings, store openings, and various festivals and celebrations. The lion, a symbol of power, wisdom, and good fortune, chases away evil spirits and brings hapiness, longevity, and good luck. The lion dance is also performed at many business locations during the Chinese New Year's Celebration for the lion brings prosperity and good luck to the business for the upcoming year. It has tradtionally been performed by martial artists.The lion dance is not only looked upon as the skillful display of strength and artistry but as the discipline of mind and body. Externally, it enhances health and is for self defense. It is also the cultivation of inner strength and self discipline to receive lifes challenges with grace and elegance. The transmission of martial arts and the lion dance is the conveyance of tradition, lineage, skill and relationship. It requires respect, loyalty and reverence to the Sifu, Troupe Leader, musician, fellow students and lion.The Lion Dance is enacted by two dancers. One handles the head, made out of strong, but light materials like paper-mache and bamboo. The other plays the body and the tail under a cloth that is attached to the head. A Buddha teases and accompanies the lion with a fan. The Buddha figure is significant because it represents a temple monk, who trained the lions and started the tradition.The lion is also accompanied by musicians, playing a large drum, cymbals, and a gong. The music follows the moves of the lion and symbolizes the roar of the lion. The drum follows the lion, the cymbals and the gong follow the drum player.



So please help us get some training and show us the some support. Any donations will be helpful and greatly appreciated.Respectfully grateful,Johnny TonJing Mo Tong Logistics Mananger

                        Origel Family Tornado Relief Fund: Re-building Family OrigelIn June of 2015, a tornado ravaged Morocco, IN. and demolished the home of my brother Jose Origel. The first time his home was hit, the tornado ripped through his familys home, leaving only one room standing. Thankfully, the family had just left town the day before the tornado touched down. We attempted to salvage what we could by storing what we could in the only remaining room left standing. One week later, another tornado tore this same town and completely obliterated the remaining room. This left my brother Jose, his wife Ana, and 3 sons (Adrian 9, Alfredo 6 and Aldo 4) with absolutely no earthly possessions, except for the clothes on their backs and in their bags. They are very grateful to have their lives and each other. For the time being, he is staying with family, but he is determined to rebuild a home for his family. He works tirelessly for his family and is saving every dollar, but having such an unexpected event occur can be discouraging. We are extremely grateful for any help to get them back on their feet. He has to purchase building materials, paint, wood, cement, windows, furniture, clothing and the daily essentials for his family. This is no small feat, they will need funds to do that. It is our goal to pay it forward for any help we receive.We will also be hosting a fundraiser in Dyer, Indiana in August (further details on dates and times will be posted soon). You can come out and meet the family and hear their story first hand. Complete details will be posted soon. Thank you for your help every amount helps. God Bless you.This page is hosted by his sister, family and friends.

Help me fund my Berlin trip! ,"$1,060 ",$606 ,Events," June 19, 2016",34,3,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,195000,1,2,"

INDIANAPOLIS, IN                                




Some of you know that I have been wanting to go to Berlin for a very long time. I finally scrimped and saved enough money from tax returns and gigs and birthday money to buy my flight for September. Now I'm faced with a frustrating reality.It's taken me a long time to finally make a trip like this because it's never been financially feasible. When I started planning this I was in a little better shape, but my rent went up unexpectedly in April so that put a big dent in my financial stability.

The flight tapped all the money I had saved up and now I am worried about the incidental costs of traveling and being in another country for 2 weeks. I don't really make enough at my job to save what I need in the time I have. I was hoping that I would have some gigs this summer to save some vacation funds before I go, but that didn't really happen either. I have a gig in Berlin, but it's a small shindig, not a big fancy schmancy one.

I've kinda run out of things to hock/sell, and while I would rather just work my DJ skills for money, that option is just not presenting itself right this minute.

So here I am. I'm not trying to get rich off this fundraiser, and I despise even needing to ask. But I want to make sure I have money for transit and food and any other incidentals that are sure to pop up while I am away.

Maybe I can do a special mix or some songs or stickers for those of you who help out. Or maybe I will just have to owe you a beer or a meal sometime in the future. But whether I can ever repay your kindness or not, know that this means the world to me to get to see more of the world and spend some time in a new place with old friends.

Thank you for any help you can spare. <3P.S. And of course, if you would rather book me to DJ so I can work for my money, that's awesome, too. ;)

Get Kams to Prom,"$3,595 ","$3,250 ",Events," March 14, 2016",48,6,BRONX,NY,187000,,1,"

BRONX, NY                                





                        Hey everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Kamary Morales, one of the kindest, strongest, selfless and most lovable young people I've ever met. I've had the privilege of working with Kamary, aka Kams, the last 2 years wi th the Cardinal Spellman Players. Throughout this time she's exhibited the kind of leadership and grace one would expect only from someone well into the later years of their life. The demands of high school are many for any student in this day in age, and Kamary has plowed through the many demands maintaining her sunny disposition and trademark smile, but this past fall, she had the unfortunate circumstance of losing her father, her ""biggest fan,"" as she has said. Through this time her family has encountered financial hardship and has not been able to keep up with Spellman's tuition. Despite a grant from the school and an insurance payment, there is still a balance that needs to be paid before she can participate in prom and graduation. Normally, I wouldn't do such a thing as ask for help, but this young lady deserves to culminate her high school career with her best friends and have not only the memory and experience of her senior prom, but also the opportunity to walk across the stage and hear her name called at graduation, ready to take on her next 4 years of college with a clean slate. Help me and other educators in Kamary's corner raise enough to get her across the finish line! Karma is a boomerang and any amount at all will help! We appreciate your generousity.

                        Brandy has been a dedicated mother for the past 9 years. She has 4 boys Rio 9, Milo 8, Atticus 6, and Aleister 18 months. These boys have been her pride and joy and she has done everything she can to give them the lives they deserve. When Rio and Milo were both dx with Autism, Brandy's niece, Kate, did everything in her power to help Brandy with the boys. Kate even decided to be the boys respite worker and devoted her time to this family. Just like Brandy helped out babysitting and taking care of Kate on and off throughout her childhood. They've always had a special bond, and been a strong influence in each other's lives. Kate even moved in! Kate lived with the family part time over the last year and full time for the last few months as she finished and graduated high school. Kate devoted her life to this family and now has devoted her life to this country. She will be going in full time active duty into the Army into Human Resources.In August, Brandy is hoping to attend the graduation ceremony of Kate finishing basic training. She'd like to be there to watch her niece and show her support. Kate graduates on the 17th of Aug and celebrations go into the 18th in Fort Jackson, SC. Kate's parents likely won't be able to attend and I feel it's very important for every person signing up to fight for this country to have someone they love to hug them at the end of the celebration. This is one of Kate's biggest accomplishments!Since Brandy will have to take Aleister flying is a must. I have decided to help by making her this gofund because I know this is the only way she'll be able to go. I'm asking for all of your help. We all know how much this would mean to her, and Brandy is such an amazing friend to all of us!Between flight, hotel, car, meals, and little things all adding up I'm setting the goal at $900, but I'd love for her to be able to not have to worry about anything while she's there!! Remember every little bit counts!! Can you help me help Brandy see Kate graduate? Can you imagine Kate's face when she sees Brandy  #priceless

                        My name is Dr. Wendy Carter-Veale. As the creator of TA-DA!Thesis and Dissertation Accomplished and PhD completion.com my passion is to help graduate students successfully complete their education.  Research shows that 50% of all graduate students do not complete their degree and 17% leave graduate school because they are unable to finish their dissertation.  I am creating a Dissertation Writing Retreat in North Carolina where graduate students will be able to write, without distractions, in a peaceful country setting. As a dissertation coach I travel around the country to offer my services to graduate students at various universities. Over the years hundreds of graduates students have been able to take advantage of these dissertation writing bootcamps.  With this Writing retreat scholars can come for the weekend, or for a week. Students will spend the time away from the stress of their everyday life and concentrate on their writing.  Help me help graduate students reach their long-term goals. A good dissertation is a done dissertation.The funds are needed to purchase and renovate a 4 bedroom 2 bath historic home located in a small country town on a 1.95 acres located in Rich Square, NC. This is an ideal site located in eastern NC, 45 minutes from the VA border and 2 hours from Raleigh.

JUNCTION CITY, OR                                




This is my Dad, Bill Gunther. He is having his 100th Birthday in January and I would like to visit him.My name is Marc Gunther . You may know me by my radio/TV/performing name Marc Time. That is the name I have used since the mid 70's when I did radio shows and played music in the San Francisco Bay Area for new wave bands like the Jars, Bo and many other bands. For the past 15 years I have been involved in the Eugene music and art scene by donating my time and services to adding a little more art, fun, music and beauty to the Eugene /Springfield area. Currently I have my award winning radio program on KWVA's ""The Sunday Morning Hangover"" , as well as radio appearances on Veneta's KOCF and on NYC Columbia University radio with Andy Caploe's ""The Monkey Cage"" as well as a three local cable TV shows. During the past six years I was a founding member of the Eugene Storefront Art Project , started the Springfield Art Walk, and served as a member of the Post Office to Museum Project. Ever since we put art in empty storefronts in downtown Eugene and Springfield there was a buzz created which led to artwalks,events and more commerce. Eventually business came back to our once blighted city center.My life has been a financial struggle recently due to lack of funds and full time employment, coupled with medical bills and IRS bills.I have served many hours volunteering without pay and have been helped greatly by my wife Barbara, who also has served so much in the local Animal Welfare community. My 2 jobs as a merchandising representative have both slowed down to a crawl this summer and I am spending all my funds on catching up on bills.I take after my Dad , William F. Gunther , who in his younger days served as President and Chairman of many community organizations in the New Haven Connecticut area and who was a successful salesman in the Insurance industry .He served his country in the Navy in WWII and Korea. Bill, now 99 years old(!) lives in an assisted living center with his wife Mary Lou in upstate New York. I have managed to visit him from the West Coast to the East Coast a number of times in the last 20 years, which involves taking time off, booking flights for two, meals, car rentals and lodging. I especially want to see him in January because he is turning 100 years old, the oldest member of the Gunther family. Most of my other relatives have passed away. In order for us to visit my Dad I have to raise funds to cover lost wages, air fare, travel and lodging expenses. Unfortunately , due to IRS/ACA penalties and recurring medical issues I have not been able to save up for this visit this year. I will probably catch some static from some friends and family for doing this but I am asking for some help. I have a large number of friends and contacts on social media, and all I am asking for is a dollar or two from each of you. I love my Dad and even though he is in good health I never know if this will be the last time I see him. This is the first time I have ever done anything like this, and I am feeling somewhat ashamed. But we really could use some help,please. I will have to book flights early this fall because Dad's birthday is the first week of January. We want to stay close by so that we can see as much of him as possible. This not simply a vacation for my wife and I (we have had only one 5 day vacation in the last three years),this is so important to our family and would mean so much. Please help me see my Dad at least one more time. Thank you!

Our Wedding,$700 ,"$5,000 ",Events," July 20, 2016",13,2,SAINT PAUL,MN,181000,,3,"

                        The first time we met, we knew we were meant to be together. We were seeing other people, but as time progressed, we both ended up single and started dating. We really hit it off. It was real, true love. However, life interrupted our relationship and we ended up going our separate ways, despite what our hearts were telling us.We never left each others' minds. We stayed close through the years, helping one another through rough situations and always knowing that if we needed help, there would be no hesitation.Here we are, ten years later, still just as purely and deeply in love with each other as we were so long ago. In the early hours onthe fourth of July of 2016, my best friend asked me to be his wife. There was no other answer in my mind aside from YES!! It is a dream come true for both of us, to have the chance to spend the rest of our lives together. We only plan on getting married once, so we want it to be a nice, beautiful wedding.We don't have a lot of money. I am working in retail full time whileraising my beautiful little girl, and he has a decent job in the city... but weddings are extremely costly and we are hopeful that we might get some help with the funds. If you know me, you know I don't like asking for help. I'm reluctant to make this campaign, but I know we coulduse whatever you can spareto help make our wedding anamazing event that we will remember for the rest of our lives.We hopefully have the date set as October 7, 2017. I figured I'd set this campaign up just to see if we could raise anything to help with the venue, the photos, the dress, the cake, etcetera... I'm in tears as I type this because it's not just for the two of us. I'm hoping to make this occasion one that my daughter will reflect on with nothing but joy and love.I don't know how much a wedding costs. Neither of us has been married before. The goal I set for this campaign is totally unrealistic, but as Bruce Lee once said, ""Agoal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.""This the only wedding we are intending to have, and I know it will be the happiest day of our lives regardless, though it would be nice to make it as amazing as we can.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. I can't begin to tell you how grateful we are for anything you decide to donate to our happiest day. If you are unable todonate, you're still awesome for reading all of this. Thank you for your support!!If you have any questions, I can be reached at neonbeastie(@)gmail.com. Thank you again, so so so much. You're incredible.

                        Think back to your high school Prom. The dress, makeup, the suit or tux, the jewelry, the special car you used to pick up your date, the music, and decorations. Hopefully it brings back a smile! Have you ever read one of those sad newspaper stories about a carload of students getting into an accident after their Prom Dance because they went out drinking and decided to drive? It breaks your heart. We dont want that to happen to any of our kids. The purpose of this GoFundMe site is for the Silver Bay After Prom Party, hosted by the parents of the Junior Class. As our rite of passage for our junior student, we parents start raising funds for an all night lock-in party that allows the students in grades 10th-12th (regardless of whether they attend the Prom) an alcohol & drug free safe environment that is chaperoned by parents. It is a lot of fun! As we are doing this, the Junior Class students take on the challenge of the actual dance planning, decorating, Grand March & DJ music  so they are also busy planning. They play games, eat lots of food, win great prizes, and everyone has a super time! We thought we would look to you; the Aunts, Uncles, family friends, and Grandparents, and ask for a small donation to help pull this party together. Times are a little tough in the Bay area right now with the plant being shut down and donations arent coming in as strong as they usually do. Some of the other things we do to raise money is hosting the Veterans Day soup dinner, selling cookie dough and beef jerky, designing and selling t-shirts for St. Urhos Day, hosting a food stand during Bay Days and the Salmon Classic. Youve probably already helped us out at one of those fundraisers! Whatever you can do will help. Look at this way, the Powerball sales just raised 2.4 billion dollars by people spending $2 per ticket! We certainly dont need 2.4 billion dollars! Imagine what your $5 or $10 could do for the kids when we all put it together!! You wont have the excitement of the possibility of winning a huge jackpot, but, that donation may help one the kids you know win a fun prize! Prom is May 6, in the Kelley High School Galley. The After Prom Party will be in the Gymnasium, so the kids dont even have to leave the school. If you are in town, we would love for you to stop by and check out the After Prom Party and see the prizes and games. If you are not, know that your donation is going to a great cause. The Junior Class parents thank you from the bottom of our hearts and the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students who attend will thank you from the bottom of theirs!

                        We are Tigers For Liberty, a registered student organization for conservative and libertarian students at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. In an effort to provide diversity of opinion at our school after an event hosted by the Trinity Progressives on microaggressions, we are planning to bring in Milo Yiannapolous to speak to our campus and the community about the same topic. However, Trinity is requesting that we pay $1600 for 8 campus police officers providing security. We need to raise these funds before the event April 10th or we will not be able to host Milo.If we are unable to raise $1600, $400 will cover the cost of security for the next largest available venue, a 200 seat auditorium. The $1600 will cover the cost of security for security for the larger, 2700 seat auditorium. The event will be free and open to the public.The Student Involvement office has not provided a definite cost yet- the highest estimate provided to us so far is $1600.News article on our efforts:  http://hypeline.org/texas-school-attempts-to-censor-milo-yiannopoulus/ Funds donated through this page will not go into a Tigers for Liberty account, but will reimburse a member of the club who is paying the cost out of their own pocket. Any funds in excess of the costs of the event will be donated to the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant, a scholarship fund created by Milo Yiannopoulos.

                        I am excited for this year. I am turning 26 years old (oh lord time goes fast). I have been blessed all my life with great friends and family (+COKA COLA). This year special, I am turning 26 years but also the future mother of the President, the women who carried me for 9 months, became my nurse, teacher,my number one fun and always believed in me SHE IS TURNING 60 years old (60 is the new 30 lol). THIS IS big to us as she will be the FIRST person in my FAMILY to reach the age and I want to give her the best GIFT. There no better gift that I can give to my MOTHER than ME going HOME this summer in RWANDA. I want to surpriseher. She think I am not coming this year. AS many of you know I am currently STUDYING in US and AIRPLANE TICKET from Dallas to Rwanda is not cheap. I am reaching out to friends for HELP. Instead sending gifts to me for my 26 Birthday please contribute to my ticket ($5,$10,$30,$40..) I appreciates all of your support and helping me give my mother the best gift. Thank you all so much!

                        For the past three years, we at the Halloween Committee in Phoenix, Arizona have built an independent garage haunted house, completely free to all who love a good scare on Halloween night.It all started with some plastic sheets, store-bought costumes and the hard work of volunteers. It's still completely volunteer run, but as the word continues to spread throughout our neighborhood each year,our attendance grows, and we are committed to making the experience better each time.SVMA stands for Silent Valley Mental Asylum.This year's theme will be more ambitious and intense than any of our previous themes. We are building on the work we've already done by expanding the square footage over 60%. Planned features include a padded cell, a distorted mirrored hallway, ceiling scares, video monitors, an interactive ""lobby"", serpentine line dividers, and more.Planned construction starts in about two weeks, and every cent of your donation will go directly into the haunted house. The more we are able to raise, the better the experience will be.This project is our way of contributing to our community, and creating lifelong memories for both kids and adults. Many of us on the Halloween Committee still remember the thrill of discovering a home made haunted house on our trick or treat runs. The ability to recreate those feelings in hundreds of other people each year is indescribably rewarding. (Not to mention, the thrill of doing the actual scaring!)In addition to our sincerest gratitude and thanks, your donation will be rewarded with a selection of enticing perks! See our list of donation rewards.Help us make Halloween memories to last a lifetime!

LAPWAI, ID                                





                        Our parents and pastors, Hilliard and Elena Smith, are celebrating 50 years of marriage and ministry together this year. They have dedicated their lives to ministering to others needs from the very start . Praying, preaching, and pouring into other people across numerous continents, they have given up homes and jobs to fulfill the call of God in their lives. Living by faith and trusting God to meet their needs for 40+ of those years, they have traveled the world, overcoming sickness, blindness, and even death along the way. However, their times to relax and just enjoy life outside of ministry have been few and far between. We are wanting to honor and thank them for their dedication to each other and to God by sending them on the honeymoon/vacation they never took. We are asking you who have been blessed by their friendship and ministry to join us in sowing a blessing into their life's to make this trip possible. Thank you and God Bless,The children and churches

                        Disciples 4 Christ - CampUnite Program...Disciples 4 Christ a Texas non-profit organization, has a heart for prisoners and their families. Our mission is to break the generational curse of incarceration, and put a purpose back into the lives and hearts of these individuals through the love of Christ. Without a plan and a goal, the statistics show that 1 out of 3 ex-offenders will be re-incarcerated within a year of their release. By encouraging lasting change we can reduce recidivism, stop the cycle of crime, and help these men and women become productive citizen of society.Support Camp Unite where children spend a wonderful day with their incarcerated parent. The camp isdesigned to share Christ love, hope and mercy with prisoners, their children(age 5  18) and caregivers such as spouses, grandparents and, guardians. Center around family fun actives including games, crafts, music, face painting, lunch, a movie and popcorn, where they experience, love, forgiveness and start on the road to reconciliation. Statistic indicate that a child of an incarcerated parent has a 70% chance of following in that parents footsteps. Research suggests that intervening in the lives of incarcerated parents and their children to strengthen positive family connections can yield positive societal benefits. This prevent an at-risk child from turning to gangs ordrugs and ensures a positive future for the children of incarcerated prisoners. In September 2014 we hosted our first Day with Dad on the Hughes Unit in Gatesville Texas, little did we know this event would open up another avenue of ministry for us. That is when Camp Unite was birthed and why weve committed to hostingfour additional events in 2015.We are hoping to raise enough moneyto coverall the remaining events on our 2015 calendar. Will you help us reach this goal by making a donation today? Thank you for your generosity and supportIn His ServiceSusan Neyra and the D4C Board of Directors
