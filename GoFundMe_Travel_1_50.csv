                        Hi, my name is Mel. Some of you might know Armando (my hubby) and I through Westfalia Digital Nomads, but for those of you who don't, I'll give you a brief background.We've been traveling, living and working in Europe, from our van. His name's Mork and he's a bright blue T4 Westy. We're both freelancers (I'm a writer, Armando's a filmmaker) and we work full-time remotely, on our journey, to pay for our travels.We also try to help others with working online or remotely ('digital nomads') and giving advice for living in a van as a couple. Without killing each other. Grin. You can take a look at our website: Westfalia Digital Nomads and find us on Facebook.

 This year, we decided to make a change. To leave Europe, and start exploring my home country, the United States. I'm originally from Montana, and Armando hasn't yet met most of my family. It seemed like a great new adventure for us.We shipped our van to Canada and drove from Halifax to Alberta, to cross the border to Montana.We were both so excited.Unfortunately, at the United States border, Armando was turned away. We didn't think he'd need an official visa (such as the I-129 for fiances, or the I-130 for spouses who want to emigrate) because we're married and Italians are allowed 90 days visitation. We thought it'd be best to get informed about required paperwork in the States, for one simple reason: trying to comprehend the chaos of legalese from abroad is terrifically confusing.But because we're married, they won't let him in - in case he decides to 'live there illegally,' which of course was never our intention.In hindsight, always 20/20, it was probably more than naive of us.We were also told, at the U.S. border, that our van wouldn't be allowed through, since it's a European model. We were sent back to the Canadian border. Things got worse. They decided they'd rather not have us in Canada either, since there were problems with entering the States, and gave us 3 days to leave.I'm going to Montana, back to my hometown, with our dog, Ziggy. Armando's flying back to Milan, Italy. Mork, our van, our office and our home, will stay in a storage lot in Canada until we can afford to have him transported across Canada to Halifax. We'll then ship the van back to Europe.Our family is in pieces. We're asking for your help to raise money to get our van back to Europe. So that I can then join my husband Armando, with Ziggy, and we can somehow get our lives back together.We aren't asking for much individually. Even the price of a coffee, $1 or 1, would help if everyone chipped in. Or even just sharing our campaign with friends on your social media would be great.Anything, really, that you can do to help will be appreciated. We're so thankful for the outpouring of support and encouragement we've had in the past 2 days of struggling to find solutions and making some really hard decisions that - we hope - will be best for us all.That we hope - beyond hope - will get us reunited as a family.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.Mel, Armando, Ziggy and Mork

OWINGS MILLS, MD                                





                        Hello, My name is Brian. When I was four years old I was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I got my first wheelchair in fifth grade. I am now 33 years old anbbd require a Ventilator to help me breathe because my muscles are too weak to breathe on my own. I am unable to walk and do basic activities of daily living without assistance from my Nurses. I have some use of my hands to hold a pen/stylus to operate my wheelchair and my computer.I have been very fortunate to have surpassed the life expectancy of most people with my disease. My family and friends have loved and supported me through all of the hard times that I had in my life. Now that I am getting older I realize that there are things that I would still like to do while I still am able. I began making my bucket list. At the top of my list is to go on a Cruise. I would appreciate any contribution that anyone can make to make my dream happen.My goal is to go on a cruise within the next year since I don't really know how much time I have left. This would mean the world to me because I am very limited as to what I can do. It would make me feel like a normal person.You have no idea how grateful I would be if I could actually do this.My Dad is helping me with all this, he is my beneficiary and he's great :) He is helping me organzize and move things a long. Also Helping Me is my Awesome Mom & Terrific Nurse Kim, Thanks!

BROOMFIELD, CO                                





                        In 2013 I decided to try to climb Mt. Everest. The biggest and most obvious obstacle to getting a chance to do this was the exorbitant cost of this expedition. It was completely out of my possibilities as a mountain guide and musician, but I decided to try and raise money and see how far I would get. The most amazing thing happened! Friends, family and lots of past clients of mine, clients that I had guided on many expeditions, donated generously! My good friend, famous Andes Survivor and painter Eduardo Strauch not only painted the great expedition logo but donated several paintings that sold for thousands of dollars and further helped fund the expedition! I ended up raising the incredible amount of $31,685 dollars!! I never expected such an amazing response! It was incredible! I was still more than $25,000 dollars short of what the final cost would be but I was not going to pass on this incredible opportunity. So I used up my credit to pay the rest of the costs for this chance to realize a life long dream of mine.I trained as hard as I could: working out 6 days a week, including many trail runs up in the Boulder foothills and more than 40 ascents (in one year) up Colorado high peaks as well as several ascents up the Mexican Volcanoes, and Mt. Rainier, many of these ascents during an unusually harsh, windy and stormy winter in Colorado. All this while fundraising and working full time in music and guiding. Finally in April 2014 I went to Nepal and after some initial set backs (a cold and fever on the trek up to Base Camp and some sleep apnea on the first week there), I found myself, after a week at base camp at 17,500': healthy, strong and ready to go for the summit of Mt. Everest! But on April 18 as we were headed up the ice fall for the first time an avalanche hit the glacier above and killed 16 sherpas and injured many more. It was the most deadly day in Everest history! I helped with the injured at the medical tent and did what I could to help during this tragedy. It was a tough day for all of us on Everest and we were very lucky we didn't leave earlier or we could have died on that same avalanche! I didn't realized that day that this would set a chain of events that would result in all of the expeditions being forced to abandon their summit attempts. Two weeks later we were all forced to leave the mountain with no chance to do any further climbing.My life long dream of summiting the highest point in the planet vanished and I was left with the sadness of seeing 16 sherpas, fellow mountaineers that climbed for a living (like me) die.On a less important note: unfortunately, I was left with a big debt that I am working hard to pay off. I am presently working hard and making substantial payments every month to pay that debt and as of 2016 I am almost done paying it.After the expedition many of my donors offered to donate again and make this happen once again!! I am extremely moved by this incredible gesture. It reawakens my life long dream! Can I really get a chance to summit Everest like I thought I had? Their generosity has inspired me to try again and this is why I started a new fund raising campaign.It's a tall order to raise $55,000 dollars to make this happen but we did it once, and mostly with small donations (as well as a few very large and extremely generous ones!), and so I know it's possible to do it again if YOU want to make this happen. Luckily, I have the gear now and Nepal has offered us to use the $10,000 2014 climbing permit within 5 years. So that is $10,000 less I have to raise. Also I have found ways to cutting costs. That is why the goal is set to $30,000 now.If we do not raise enough to make Everest happen I have the option of climbing other high peaks in Nepal. Many of the other 8000 meter peaks (the 14 highest peaks in the world) cost about half or less than Everest to climb and the 6000 and 7000 meter peaks are even les expensive. No matter how much we raise every dollar donated on this campaign will be used to climb a high peak and I will share this great adventure with you through my photos and dispatches.If you donated money for my last expedition, you know what your donation large or small can do! We made the Everest expedition happen!! We really did!We made it to the exotic and fascinating places in Nepal including the highest mountains in the world! This adventure not only changed my life in a very positive way but inspired a lot of people! I was very happy to hear from friends/donors how this expedition was inspiring them to start working towards important goals in their lives that they had previously thought too hard to attempt!If you are thinking about donating for the first time, consider that you can be part of this very exciting adventure. Even with a small donation of $25 you can fund your own expedition potentially to the highest point on the planet!... and I will show you, up close what is like to do this step by step with my dispatches and photos.If you want to sponsor your own Everest expedition, if you want to help me realize a life long dream of climbing the highest mountain in the world, if an adventure like this inspires you and you want to help inspire more people to achieve great things in life: Donate now! We can make this happen if YOU donate!From the bottom of my heart: Thank you!!!Ricardo PeaFor more information about my mountaineering visit:  www.alpineexpeditions.net

My son Xavier was selected to participate in an International Travel Program with his High School in February 2017.I'm a very overprotective momand was against the thought ofmy oldest child traveling abroad withouthis mom and dad. With the recent acts of terrorism throughout the world, any parents first thought would be to keep their child close and in the safety of their own home. I had to realize that my fears can't be projected unto him. This is an opportunity of a lifetime that many young men of color within our communities are not afforded. This trip will undoubtedly change his perspectives of the world and enhance his education as a whole. Xavier is the oldest of five (5)siblings and if my husband and I could afford to pay today we would without a doubt. We are trying to raise $4000.00 to cover the cost of the total trip and other expenditures associated. Any amount donated would be wholeheartedly appreciated and received with gratitude and love. I have provided a link to the website where you can view the itinerary of this wonderful adventure.  www.eftours.com tour # 1911025HX

                        Hello, My Name is Ruby.I am a freshman at a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) high school. My passion is engineering and as a female, I know that is not typical. An opportunity has come up with a program called Sister Cities that allows me to travel to Japan and stay in the home of a local family for a week and learn about the culture of a city similar in size to my own. I am currently taking an AP Human Geography class so I know that my first international travel will help greatly.I am very excited about this opportunity but unfortunately, the funds for the flight came quicker for this trip than my parents could plan for; as I just got accepted last week and my trip is in November!If you would like to donate, that would be wonderful! Your donation would go towards the flight to (and from) Japan. I am staying with a family and other travel expenses will be covered by my parents.I am nervous about the trip but I do know several others in the travel group. I believe this will give me a great foundation of another culture and could help me in my engineering studies and career as well.For your donation, I will send you a post card from Osaka, Japan.Thank you so much.Ruby

Explore the Edges UltraTrip,"$2,020 ","$10,000 ",Travel," September 13, 2016",24,12,CINCINNATI,OH,123000,,,"






                            Susie Crossland-Dwyer
                            
                            
                                                           
CINCINNATI, OH                                




THE TRIPIn February 2017, we will embark on a 7-week journey that will take us to the literal edges of the world map (and our personal limits) to run ultra-marathons on some of the most rugged, beautiful trails this planet has to offer. Its an impossible trip that we have no logical business taking, except that our hearts are calling us to do it.It will include over 39,000 miles of flying, roughly 300 miles of mountain running from as far and wide as The Land of Fire at the glaciated southern tip of Argentina to the International Appalachian Trail whose mountains traverse the Atlantic Ocean and terminate in Northern Ireland. We will bivouac in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, South Africa, and Ireland, creating DIY races, inviting the locals to join in, and throwing ourselves upon the generosity of strangers & friends who will be our hosts.THE THEMEThe purpose of this journey is to explore edges. The edge of an ecosystem is where evolution happens. Its where the tapestry of the city frays into the wildness of nature. Its where the convention of roads give way to gravel, then trail, and ultimately to freedom. Its where the artifice of the establishment dissolves into the ecology of grit. Most importantly, when we push through our boundaries, its where the concept of self transforms into something beautifully new. THE INTENT We plan to run 300 milesessentially an ultra-marathon of 35-60 miles in each location. And we are running like mad dogs to make it happen. Sweat equity is the currency and a universal language that transcends borders. We are doing this on the cheap - staying with gracious hosts who have offered their homes.Our goal is to have 300 participants in this project--in the form of training partners, guides, hosts, cheerleaders, patrons, and consultants. We cant do this alone and we dont want to do this alone. We hope to start a chain reaction, where we all become the hosts and patrons and enablers of each others grand adventures and hopes and dreams.At the moment, we have secured no charity partners as weve yet to find one that intersects with all our passionsfor badassery, for physical movement, for nature, for cross-cultural connection, for fully living ones life purpose. But do not be mistaken. We WILL make something from this experience that goes beyond our own personal travel and running. We are committed to documenting and sharing ALL of this experience through our writing/ blogging, visuals, and storytelling. (We already blog on our website INHABITtoday.com ) We also plan to contribute something even more tangible to the common good that arises OUT OF the adventure, not something prematurely pre-determined. THE CAST OF CHARACTERS & THE HISTORYWe--Susie and Chrislove our rootedness in Cincinnati and have enjoyed watching our city grow up. Weve poured our heart and soul into creating a small space of lovestudio s--here. Its a place where people can sweat, become stronger, meet new friends, be supported in their lifes great work, and positively engage themselves in each others lives.We believe that travel as an essential nutrient, not only for cultivating a nourished soul, but for continuing to pour our best out to others. We think Cincinnati is doing really cool stuff AND so is the rest of the world. We see travel as a critical import-export activity, not just in the sphere of goods and services, but in the service of ideas, emotions, inspirations, relationships, and consciousness.THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOMOn the surface, this MAY look like two people mooching off of friends, taking exotic selfies on a journey of self-indulgence... without even building an orphanage in a world where orphanages are needed! We get that.But, just maybe a little bit of responding to ones deep dreamsand offering what arises from that--is what the world needs. Maybe more of us thinking in terms of abundance and possibility is also what the world needs. To let you know how serious we are about this project and how deep our commitment to it is, weve taken the following steps:-One year of nitty-gritty planning and relying on community support to find hosts in other countries. This has already stretched our thinking on what is socially possible.-Eight months of home renovations (in order to rent our house out to save extra cash), performed by our friends and our own clumsy hands. This has built a new skill set and given us a widened appreciation of endurance artisans. -Six months of no spending money on anything personal including meals out, coffee, social engagements or new anything!-Leaving our home of 11 years and moving into our parents unfinished basement with our four animal babies in order to create extra savings. Moving and creating a communal living dynamic has challenged us to expand our concept of personal space; grow the sometimes too-tininess of the modern family; broaden and deepen the bonds of our tribe; and face the edge of risk, interdependence and comfort.(For past documentation of this journey and future blogs please visit: inhabittoday.com )THE BIG ASKYour participation! Yes, this is a financial partnership campaign and our BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) is to fund half ($10k) of our projected costs of $20,000.Your financial partnership will literally make this plan happen. Here are some concretes to which we will apply your contributions:-$4000-6000 per person for our around-the-world plane tickets.-$142 per person registration for the sanctioned race we will run. Its called the Shotover Moonlight Marathon (we will make it an ultra-marathon) in Queenstown, NZ. http://activeqt.co.nz/event/shotover-moonlight-marathon --transportation like taxis, shuttles, buses.How much to give? Maybe think of it as taking us out for a metaphorical dinner. Or what would a great date cost--where you ate well, confided among loved ones/ friends, bounced your hopes and dreams off each other and really felt supported? We cant do this without you, and we dont want to do it alone.

Change is the ONLY constant. I have enjoyed my return to Ames, but after spinning my wheels for 6 years I am going to be heading out on the road. 
This will be a months-long trip without a timetable.
 I will be hitch hiking with Gabe, my Springer Spaniel. Our eventual destination is Oregon in the Spring, but I am going South first to avoid winter weather. I hitch hiked to Alaska in 1992 and will take the lessons from that and other survival situations with me.
 I have a limited income, good camping gear and clothes for all weather. I would like to be able to take time and experience the areas that we travel through.
 I will also try to ""couch surf"" as well. If you can put us up for a couple of nights maximum, let me know. I have a cellphone and I will be reporting our progress on Facebook.
 Any assistance you can provide will go towards camping fees, food and eventually a place to settle down. Thanks for anything you can donate.

Demo Website:  http://campsite.stagingdevsite.com/Have you ever been frustrated by the process of searching for a campground?

Over the last few years, the lack of coherent campsite information on the internet has annoyed me to no end. Many websites post inadequate photos of the campgrounds or no photos at all. More lacking still, detailed reviews and tips about the campgrounds are hard to come by, except for the biggest campgrounds out there. I thought surely that by now someone would build a website that would merge photos, reviews, and all the information you need to confidently book a campsite, yet this type of site is still not out there.

Until now.Working with a team of experienced developers for the past fourmonths, the webpage, FindYourCampsite.com, is close to completion. The majority of campgrounds have been uploaded for the states of Colorado and Oregon, and the other states are soon to follow.

Please view the demo site here and browse through the different features:  http://campsite.stagingdevsite.com/

An example of an individual campsite page:  http://campsite.stagingdevsite.com/camp/?id=182

So why do I need your help, and the help of any fellow campers you know? There is still a ways to go to turn this visioninto a reality, and the final steps are expensive. Data mining, uploading campground data, advertising and site maintenance once the website is live..these are just a few of the things that need to be accounted for.

In return, I am offering up a 10% stake of the company with a fundraising goal of $2500. What does this mean? It means that withinsix monthsof launching the website, I plan to add sponsors and advertising on the site to draw in revenue. As a stakeholder, you will receive a percentage of the site revenue based on your donation.

For example, if you donate $500 and I raise a total of $2,500, your ownership stake will be 2% (a total of 10% ownership share available). Revenue earnings will be paid out quarterly and your opinion will be valued as future development plans are made. Let me know if you have any questions about this.

Please browse through the website like you were actually using it and don't hesitate to give me feedback, even if you are not donating to the site. You can reach mevia this page's contact information or comment below.

Here are some key features of the site, either active now or soon to come:

-The essensce of the site will be user driven. People who love to camp, like you and me, willsubmit reviews and ratings, add campgrounds if they are not listed,and uploadphotos to help grow a huge network of informed camping. The goal is no more guessing in the dark about the quality of your next camping trip.

-It will cater to car/trailer camping, RV sites, and backcountry camping among other styles.

-It will have a strong environmental mission: to give back to the organizations that help protect the outdoor areas we enjoy.

-With thatin mind, 5% of all monthly proceeds will be donated to the non-profit organization of the month.

-There is a membership rewards system to incentivize people to submit reviews, add photos, and contribute to the site. Free prizes will be given out - think bottle openers, rei gift cards, and tents - branded gifts that will enhance the camping experience.

-I will keep a running ""Blog"", that will cover all things camping and provide free content.

-It will be synced with Facebook and Instagram to help drive traffic and provide content.

Here's what you can do:1) Donate.Big or small, everydollar raised will go to the site in some capacity. I will follow up with you and let you know exactly where your money went.2) Share this page and this site.Letyour friends, family, and co workers, especially the ones that love to camp, know about this webapge and what we are trying to build. The only way FindYourCampsite.comwill ultimately be successful is to have hundreds and thousands of users contributing each in a small way.3) Give me feedback!What works well on the site? What needs improvement or change? I have only shared my idea with a handful of individuals until now. I welcome and appreciate your feedback of all types - positive orconstructive!The last thing I want to say is, if you have made to this point I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing your feedback on the site and the future plans.Thanks so much and happy camping!-Nate

                        Hello, I'm Payton! I am a Junior in the Interior Design program at Wentworth Institute of Technology. Interior design has been a passion of mine since elementary school. At Wentworth, the love has only grown and I can see myself becoming a designer. I love the work I do and every year brings more challenges that push my creativity further. Creating beautiful spaces from my own mind and seeing them come to life is an experience like no other. This summer is the opportunity of a life time. I havent left the country since I was 13 and now I have been given the chance to study in the beautiful city of Berlin, Germany. This is a 90-day program filled with culture, design, and experience. I understand this is an investment, and asking for money is something I've never been good at. My parents have always been generousto me and have helped me achieve so many of my dreams. Now, that my younger sister is in college, I am on my own to pay for my education and any other supples I may need. Now, this also includes paying my way to Germany. The money I raise will be used for airfare, housing, museums, class trips, and studio supplies. This trip will not only enhance my design skills, but I will finally be able to see first-hand the buildings I've been studying since freshman year. Embracing the architecture, sculpture, and environment of Berlin has been a dream of mine since it was introduced by my department head Sean Stewart at Accepted Students Day back in 2014. Now it is a tangible reality that in a few short months I could be a Berliner. All help is enormously appreciated and I cannot thank you enough for even reading my story. The spots are placed on a first come first basis and applications are due with deposits starting October 5th. There is a 15 student max with a 22 student major. Thank you so much again for visiting my page and contributing to the trip of a life time! Oh, and please leave your information for a post card and maybe even some design services when I graduate!

                        Two years ago I went to Nashville to explore my passion for music and further my education as a songwriter. With your help I was able to fund my first solo trip and become the Connecticut Chapter Coordinator to the Nashville Songwriter's Association.This month I am moving there to pursue music as a career. I am driving down next week to attend an NSAI event and I will to begin to look for housing. Miss Calliope will be joining me in a few weeks. I am very fortunate to have met many friends there over the years who are going to help us with the transition. However, we are going to be starting our new lives pretty much from scratch.In an attempt to raise money for the move I am doing a pre-sale of my most recent album. If you would like to purchase this cd you can do so by contributing $15 to my campaign. I will send a link to the digital download as soon as it is ready, most likely the end of this month. All other contributions will be greatly appreciated.Music means the world to me and there is nothing I want more than for Calliope to see me doing what I love. Thank you all so much for following me and supporting me over the years through this journey.Tiffany

                        Hello Friends and Family,I have recently been given the oppurtunity to study abroad in Cuba for three weeks this upcoming January. It is a wonderful oppurtunity that I am being provided with to be able to emerge myself in such a rich and unknown culture. Unfortunatley it costs $4,475, and that is simply money I do not have. I will try my best to earn as much money as I can myself, but I very much need help. I would be unbelieveably appreciative to anyone who is willing and able to me do something that is such a dream for me. So if anyone could take the time to donate to me you would be helping me accomplish something great.Thank you for your time,Morgan Underwood

SAINT PETERSBURG, FL                                





                        I have officially launched my GoFundMe Campaign to help fundraise my trip to Sierra Leone, West Africa. I will be working with local communities to build child care centers, permaculture gardens, and establish democratic governance principles. I will be in the country from Dec 2016-January 2017. What a kick ass project! In addition to the service, I will be journaling and traveling around the country to get reestablished with my West African roots. I have always wanted to go to Africa and now is the time! Please donate as you are able. There are special gifts of gratitude for special donors.Here is more about myself:Topaz is an African-American woman currently living in Saint Petersburg, FL. She is in her early 20s and has been on a path of self-discovery to find her true ethnic identity. She had never thought of herself as a person of African descendant until she went to college and began studying African-American history, working with the African Students Association and studying race and gender. She knew she had African in her blood but with an amalgamation of other races like Latino, Native American and German, she never felt quite African, rather a woman of the world. As a wise young woman, she has taken the advice of her elders to travel the globe and see the beauty of world cultures. Topaz is on a journey of self-discovery and is fundraising to go to Sierra Leone, West Africa. While in Africa, Topaz will be working with an organization called the Sierra Leone Foundation for New Democracy, a 501.c.3 non-profit that works to cultivate community empowerment and engagement through the use of democratic decision-making principles and permaculture ethics. In other words, Topaz will aid small villages in Sierra Leone to build their own early childhood centers, grow their own food from their permaculture gardens, and develop democratic decision-making practices. As you can imagine, countries who have been riddled by the plague of colonialism and disempowerment for centuries have been asking for the skills and techniques to run and operate their own communities their own way. This is a great opportunity to answer the call and get connected with people of the African diaspora who are looking to empower themselves and their communities.As a 2015 graduate of the University of Colorado at Boulder with a B.A. in Geography and a focus on Environmental Justice, Topaz is ecstatic to be combining her passion for environmental justice with her path of self-discovery. In her eyes, this is a win-win. She is helping communities be sustainable and just while also stepping foot on the land her ancestors were taken from so many centuries ago. African-American people all over the U.S. are rediscovering their roots on the continent of Africa. It is a beautiful and exciting journey for us to take.Of the $3,000:-$1,800 goes to round trip airfare from Saint Petersburg, Florida to Freetown, Sierra Leone-$1,200 goes to program fee for the Sierra Leone Foundation for New Democracy. Pays for food, lodging and transportation.Help make a dream come true! Donate today!SPECIAL DONOR OFFER:Donate $100 or more and you will receive an AFRICAN GOODY BAG! Filled with:Raw African Shea ButterRaw African Black SoapSpecial one-of-a-kind gift straight from the continent!*Be sure to message me, Topaz Hooper, on Facebook after your $100 donation so I know where to send your African Goody Bag.*All African Goody Bags will be mailed on October 15th.

Alexis' Journey to India,$640 ,"$1,000 ",Travel," July 23, 2016",7,2,MACCLENNY,FL,219000,,,"

MACCLENNY, FL                                




About me: My name is Alexis and I am a 20 year old college student at the University of Mobile. I am studying Interculteral Studies, Psychology, and Music and hope to one day use my talents and abilities on the mission field in India.My Passion:Growing up I heard a lot aboutministry and missions and even went on a few mission trips but I was never impacted to do more than that. However, something changed when I journeyed to India at the age of 14. I saw people who were hungry, not just for food, but for something bigger...HOPE. I saw how much God could do with a faithful few, willing to serving Him. I even saw a member of our team come to know Christ as her savior while sharing His love with others! Hundreds--I have personally seen hundreds of people come to know Jesus as father, hope, and life! How can I not want to be a tool in the hand of God?? When I am willing He does incredible, awe inspiring, unexplainable things, through me. I am so unworthy and yet He tells me I am worth His death on the cross. He surrendered His life for mine so it is my joy to surrender my life for Him!The Cost:This upcoming trip will take place in October and language studies will take place the Summer of 2017. Both will enable me to come a few steps closer to ministering full time in country. However, there is an expense of somewhere around $2000 for travel and $500 for additional expenses (shots, visa, and passport). That is what I am hoping to cover through you, because no ministry can be done alone!

I have been an employee in the Philippines for 20 years and had been verypatientin it'ssystem of employment. But, not until we had our youngest child, for we were breaking the break even income.So, I left employment 3 years ago and decided to become a smallentrepreneur and embraced thesacrifices that goesalong with it. I tried several businesses andfailed, loosing a lot of money from loans, and our small savings, that left us very broke,until now.Two months ago, my wife and I started a cake business, selling it on facebook and to people we know, and we've been gaining postive feedbacks, here is ourlink https://www.facebook.com/pieceofcakewg/Withintwo months of operationwe were able to sell 188 cakes, averaging to 3 cakes per day... Somehow, Ifeel the need to jumpstart our small business to take advantage of this opportunity.The fund that I am asking you shall be used for the following:Build my kitchen <- That I could organize my tools and move freely on ventilated area.This is my current kitchen, its a small portion of our house intended for visitors, that I have to utilize as work area .Bigger Oven <-That Iwould be able to improve my cakeinventory,to have time to go out in the field to sell and market.This is mycurrent small, manual, two tier, very old oven.Bigger Mixer <- Tocompensate my bigger oven (as mentioned above)This mixer has been recently donated by my Mom a 1.5L capacity. The old one broke after making 3 cakes...My cakes are made with full passion, fueled by the failures, perseverance, achievements and all my life experiences... Sharing them allto every piece of cake that we bake, to cheer people up.We arewilling to send you a slice of my Sans Rival Cake for every donation that I get... but I wouldbe paying for shipment cost more thanyour donation, instead I would be giving them to charity. For every $10of the total donation that I get I will be sending oneslice of my Sans Rival to Padre Pio Orphanage, Davao City, Philippines https://www.facebook.com/pages/Padre-Pio-Orphanage/709750372428907I believe in second chances, my family means everything to me, and that I am really hoping to make it this time.

                        Hi everyone! My name is Jessica & I'm 24 years old. I decided to set up a gofundme account because of my best friend of 9 years! Her name is Tiffany, & she's 23 years old.I brought up a conversation to Tiff recently about going on a vacation at some point in the future. Shelit up at the thought, but immediately shot it down by saying we didn't have the money. She was/is right. We don't have the money.The main reason I've made this account... My Spring Break is the end of March 2017 into the beginning of April 2017. Her birthday falls in the middle of Spring Break. She's never been out of the U.S. so I really want to get her out to see new things. She hasn't been on a serious vacation, other than visiting family in other states, since she was a young child. I really want to pay for the 2 of us to go on a trip as a surprise birthday gift! Any donations received will go towards helping to pay for a flight + hotel to a location of her choosing. (I'm still trying to nonchalantly ask her where she's always wanted to go)I sincerely apologize for how long this was. I just wanted to make sure you received the story before giving or thinking about a donation of any kind. Please help me accomplish this!!! Every little bit helps!!Thank you!!xoxo Jessica

CLEVELAND, TN                                







Last year my best friend Kelly and I were asked to read a book called INTO THE WILD.  We quickly fell in love with the story of Chris McCandless, a young man who took off without a word in pursuit of his ""Great Alaskan Adventure."" His transcendentalist spiritwoke something in us that wecannot silence. Chris hikedalong the Stampede Trail in Alaska until he made it to an abandoned bus (bus 142). Once there he livedout ofthis bus until he lost his life in August of 1992. Ever since we learned of Chris, his adventurous life style, and his legacy, we have craved a visit to this bus. However the trip requiresstrong hiking/camping supplies, gas for the 70 hour drive, and food supply. These things cost much more money than two high school seniors with minimum wage jobs can afford before going off to college. If all goes as planned we hope to raise enough money by June of 2017 and then immediately gather supplies for the trip. As our last wish before we step into adulthood and go our separate ways, we planned a trip to Fairbanks Alaska to hike the Stampede Trail and see bus 142 together. During this trip, we hope to grow in our relationship withGod by being completely alone and vulerable with Christ. We pray that this hiking/camping experience will be just that.Hiking to this bus would mean more than the world to us due to the abundance of respect and interest we have towards Chris McCandless's story. Each and every penny helps, and we willpraise God for each one. We personally thank eachperson in advance who decides to donate.Please helps us make it to Bus 142!

Currently we're about 1,400 miles away from them, and are hoping to get back to them soon. The only thing that is holding us back, is that we had the misfortune of our car's engine acting weird. It eventually blew a head gasket, so, we're now stuck. If we could ask you to help us fix this problem, we would be forever in your debt. Thank you so much!

                        Hi :) our names are Steven and Devin, weare both in need of an impactful change in our lives; tired of wasting our money/time in bars. We want to experience and see so much more this world has to offer. We are simply trying to expedite this process of us getting this trip initiated so we can begin immediately.We love to have fun and make great memories but we want to obtain those with a clear mind in the environment. This Appalachian Trail hiking adventure will begin September 27th and end October 27th (so Devin is back for his b-day on October 28th!). So 30 days to take in as much as we can and figure out what our plan is for our next level in life.We have been kinda stagnant these past few years, spending way too much of our time in bars and not properly experiencing life to its fullest. Steve is a recovering alcoholic with little to really push himself forward anymore. His girlfriend, that was living with him, moved out and took him to court over their bulldog. Bentley was shortly taken away from Steve after this. Leaving a large void in his life he had a near death experience that made him realize he needed to get away and clear his mind; this might save his life.Devin, found Steve in this harmful state and brainstormed on what could be done to clear Steves mind again so we can prosper and become business juggernauts. But we cant prosper without getting out of the depression we have stored in our minds. Devin has had his fair share of misfortunes as well, losing his mother when he was a child and his dad going away to prison. Which left him being raised by a girlfriend of his dad for 2 years. A ton of financial struggle left Devin and his father distant and avoidable for years. Then numerous experiences after that helped Devin realize true happiness in life. All these experiences, either good or bad, need to be accepted, acknowledged and used to help your situation, not damper it. Devin and Steve plan on getting their minds right and moving to the next level to help the environment and the world around them. Making people see the true happiness in life and not having to live life in a depressed state. Please help us, and in return we will make sure we pay it forward in tenfold. We give our words. We will help others in the same way we plan on helping each other. If you can relate to our stories and/or see whatwe are trying to accomplish (or just simply want to help) then please donate whatever you're willing to part with to help us cover the remainder of our bills and help get supplies for our adventure! God bless!

Between the four of us, we have a long way to go financially to meet our goal. It has been our dream for a long time to travel to Rome together as a group. We are also doing fundraisers to help us out, but we need a little financial support to pay for all the costs of the trip. If you would help us reach our goal in any way possible, no matter how small, it is incredibly appreciated.

Hello! 


My name is Jeremy Joseph. I am 28 years old, and live in Carbondale, Colorado. I moved out to the mountains 8 years ago from the city of Denver, so I could study photography. Through this process I discovered a serious connection to the surrounding wilderness and mountains. After graduating I was introduced to rock and ice climbing from a close friend I met while at school. Since then, I have spent the last five years combining both passions into a full time pursuit. I currently work for a proffesional photographer ""Pete Mcbride"" in the summer, and then make photographs of dog sledding in the winter.  


I have planned a solo trip to Ecuador from the 20th of October, to the 13th of December. I have numerous goals during my stay there. First, is to experience a new culture, and open my mind to new lifestyles and ideas. I would also like to work on my spanish that I spent four years learning in highschool. Second, is to try and climb some of the glaciated volcanoes, some of which rise above 19000 feet. I have never been above 14000, so this would be a new opportunity to push my limits in mountaineering. Third, is to expand my library of photographs, and create a new portfolio. 


The money that I receive would be used for a few different things. First, it is required to hire a guide for any glaciated volcanoes in Ecuador, and it is very expensive to hire a quality guide. Second, would be for a plane ticket to travel the Galapagos Islands which has been a dream of mine for a long time. Third would be for general travel around the country in search of indigenous cultures and remote landscapes.I have lived out of my car for the last 7 months to save money for this trip. Despite this, I have found myself falling short of my financial goal. My plane ticket has been purchased, so I am going either way! 


I can't put into words how thankful I would be to have the funding to afford these goals. Thanks so much for your time in reading!

EVANS, GA                                




From my son's Instagram post on July 20th....My name is Mark Maxwell Mioducki and today is my first day riding my bicycle across USA. I will be going coast to coast from Savannah, GA (Tybee Island on the Atlantic) all the way to San Francisco on a route I mapped out myself. I have had this desire for almost two years and it has taken me over a year of working to save up and prepare for this. I will be camping where I can and trying to accomplish at least 50 miles a day on a bike with roughly 100 lbs of gear/supplies (not including my own weight)...fast forward to the afternoon of July 31st when this trip was suddenly derailed by a senseless act of violence by a crazed motorist that apparently doesn't think he should have to share the road with bicyclists. He tailgated Max honking his horn and then tried to run him off the road. At which point Max yelled at him that it was the law to give him 3 feet leyway. This angry man followed Max to a gas station and seeing Max's bike laying in the grass while he was nearby by making a phone call the driver jumped a curb in his truck and purposefully and deliberatly ran forward and backwards over the bike. Max didn't want to ask for help to make this trip but this unfortuate event has caused him to reconsider and he is now asking for your support. It will cost him at least $2000 to replace his bike and gear and we've been told this most likely will not be covered by the driver's insurance (if he even has it) because insurance companies do not accept claims for malicious distruction.Thanks to all that have expressed a willingness to help and please know how grateful both Max and I will be. He will need to order a bike which may take up to a week so it may be that long before you see trip updates.Share the road! Watch for riders of all varities.

My name is Justin - a 27 years young veteran, artist and student, who's been giving back to the world by creating ASMR videos on YouTube as PuddingWhispers(formerly known as FatFr33Pudding)Youtube.com/PuddingWhispersOver the past year and a half, Ive grown a community of over 50,000 wonderful pudding cups (my subscribers)  all of which have benefited from my videos and community in different ways. It has been so personally rewarding to provide relaxation and entertainment to so many, including relief for those suffering from anxiety, depression and insomnia.The Idea Behind This CampaignIt has been a dream of mine - since I started to realize how much I've been able to help all of you, reading the daily messages and comments about the ways I've added positivity to your lives - to meet as many of you as possible. Nothing would be more amazing than to be able to look you in the eyes and tell you how thankful I am for all of your love and support.The Goal$25k kickoff goal; $1 per subscriber wouldcome to over $55K !!!I will be able to travel to different states and major countries, to meet my pudding cups face-to-face.

What I need from youIf you donate, leave a note telling me what area you live! Even better, also include a suggestion for a centralized location where all the other pudding cups in your area may be able to meet up.This way, I can start creating a map of all the places I need to go and budget expenses accordingly.

I have been planning out the places I will visit and I have been seeking out loads of travel advice (please share if you have any). I have a strong desire to do something that is entirely selfless before becoming entirely selfish (going to gradschool). Since I will be pretty free after graduation, I plan to stay for awhile and I want to devote some of my time to working in orphanages. So for my birthday this year if you would like to do something for me, please donate to my SELFLESS IN INDIA trip!I love you all! Anything will help xo~Kirraps if you already helped... thank you soooo much!

LAS VEGAS, NV                                





                        My name is Ella and I am turning 13 on August 27th. One of my favorite things to do is to see shows and experience new things! I want to see Lion King in San Diego in September, but the tickets and travel expenses are a little out of the budget for mom and dad. So this year for my birthday if anyone would like to help send me to see Lion King, you can donate to this ""Gotta Go Lion King"" campaign. The paragraph above was written by us (mom and dad), as Ella is severely Autistic and not able to communite well enough to write this herself, or we would indeed have her do so.For the past year Ella has been asking ""Gotta Go Lion King"". Up until recently, we thought it was only in New York, which was not an option. So we would tell her ""Im sorry Ella, it's in New York"" Her response then became ""Gotta Go New York""!After discovering we could take her in September to San Diego, we were very excited! The only challenge is that the tickets are a bit costly in combination with the travel expenses for the three of us to go.Ella's pure joy for shows and outing like this are beautifl. This is a clip from after a Mystere show.

We would be forever grateful, as would Ella, to anyone who can contribute as a birthday gift to Miss Ella! As a child with Autismshe really gets fixated on certain things, and this is for sure one of them. She spends hours every week on YouTube watching videos, and listening to the songs. She brings us the iPad at least 3-4 times a day to tell us ""Gotta Go Lion King"".We would like to get the tickets in the first couple weeks of August toplan the trip accordingly.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Taking Ella to shows and movies, having her experience life to the fullest everyday is so importamt to us. Her happiness and smile is priceless.As a thank you to anyone who donates, Ella will be sending custom tokens of her appreciation (like a beautiful coloring below)and pictures fromthe event!

Pray for Savvy Faye,"$5,855 ","$7,000 ",Travel," September 10, 2014",102,24,OKLAHOMA CITY,OK,5600,,29,"

OKLAHOMA CITY, OK                                





                        Savvy Faye McCoy was born on September 8th, 2014 at 8:51pm weighing in at 1lb 6oz and 11.5 inches long. Little girl came at 24 weeks gestation which makes her a micro preemie. Daddy was working in Pecos 8 hours away when mommy went into labor at work. He made it home in just 6 hours time.. baby girl waited just long enough for daddy to be there with mommy when she made her early debut. Savvy has a tough fight ahead of her but we whole heartedly believe that God has His hands all over our sweet girl. He is with her every step of this journey and we are trying to take comfort in that. She has such a fighting spirit.We undestand that the next several months our time is going to be consumed with being in the NICU and being the support that Savvy needs. As many of you know, Thomas works half the month away on a rig in West Texas. Considering the circumstances and the distance he has to travel.. we arent sure when hewill be able to return to work while Savvy is in such a critical stage of her life. S needs her daddy around and mom definitely needs daddiessupport right now.  With that being said, we know in the next couple of months we are going to face many trials and obstacles as a family. Its not going to only be tough emotionally and physically but also financially. Life is still going to keep moving forward. So with humble hearts we are praying for relief in any way we can receive it. We thank you so much for all the continuous prayers, support, meals and encouraging words that so many of you have offered to us. We will continue to update as often as we can and we apologize if we arent able to get back to everyone right away. Please, Please don't cease in praying for our Savvy, we know He is hearing our cries and we believe in miracles...  The McCoys

I can hardly believe it has almost been a year since I graduated from the University of Memphis and received my degree in Professional Studies with a dual focus in dance and therapy. Now it is time for me, Angel Ceara Clark, to move forward in my pursuit of becoming a world renowned Dance Therapist. It is to this end that I must relocate to New York City.As many of you know, this has been a dream and a vision since I was a 7th grader in middle school. My family and I have worked diligently to make this dream a reality. The support I have received from my immediate family and closest friends has been awesome. Nonetheless, moving to New York is a giant and costly step (cost of living). With this in mind, I am reaching out asking for your help.Funds raised will be used to ensure my transition is smooth, and that I can take care of necessary expenses--housing, food, and transportation until I am settled. Your financial blessing to me will be most appreciated.

It seemed like her, a way to give back to her family what she shared with all of us. Pamwas full of energy and had a real sense of adventure. Travel was important to her. She wanted to share the world with her kids. On that note, we've created The Stormo-Flanagan Adventure Fund. Our hope is this fund will one day, in the months or years to come be used as a way for her family to honor her. ForMark, Berit, Rowan and Griffin to have their own adventure.  A celebration of her life.  May we all live as generously and passionately as she did. We miss you Pamela Stormo!

WINTER PARK, FL                                





Hey you guys! My name is Jacob Gibbs and Im currently majoring in Game Art, studying at Full Sail University Throughout these past few months I have had a gratifying experience amongst my peers and instructors. Learning the ins and outs of my industry early on compared to most schools.Aside from my education, my friends will ultimately be the ones whose broadness of ability and confidence in mine will grant me a foot into the industry. Now, I would like to be inspired abroad to further my education in regards to both a culture and myself. During one of my few breaks from school there is an opportunity to experience Tokyo, Japan in December. I have never traveled in a matter like this. Truthfully, I dont want to live with the uncertainty of who I would be without this trip. It means a great deal to me, and my best friend (who is also attempting to partake in this trip.) Ive been running through how to budget this trip in both my head and to as many friends as possible. Most of that coming from compromise from housing money, working through Full Sails federal work study program, and generous donations from family.  Thetotal costof this trip is$3,945and will last 8 days That goes towards my round trip ticket    $1800 for the plane ticket (Price will vary)    $1520 goes towards tour guides, transportation, hotel, food, and other basic necessities  $320 for this trip being a private group of 15  19 studentso The more students that join this trip the lower the price gets for that initial fee (It was initially 580) $150 for my first passport  $155 is for global insurance in case I am to be injured or sick at any time during this this trip. What that will grant me:Full Iterniary   Sightseeing o Tokyo o Mt. Fuji o Hakone National Park  Japanese Language & Culture Orientation  A free day to explore Tokyo at my own discretion  Visiting the Studio Ghibli Museum  Much more in between Now the way the payments are setup:  6 Payments of $612.00 due every month on the 20th What will I be doing in my free time to offset the costs of donations? During JuneI will be taking a month off from Full Sail to better prepare my portfolio, seek out inspiration, work at the school, and dedicate time to these ways of offsetting the cost for you, the donor.  Grants  Scholarships  Sponsorships from companies and their products to possibly use overseas  Federal Work StudyAfter this month I feel confident that I will be able to raise the latter $1,000 for the trip compromising financially during school. Any donation is a deeply appreciated. I want to leave off with this. There are dreams and then there is my best friends dream of visiting Japan. Ive never known this person more than 5 months but in that time I have learned more about her each day. In tandem with myself. Although I want to keep things professional on this trip, I understand that there is nothing wrong with being moved as a person. What I really want from this trip is to see her face when we fly immense hours overseas and she cant contain her happiness thereafter. Ultimately I want to see someones dreams be achieved, because said dreams are worth it. If you are interested in donating to my friend Cassie Cerpa please click here .

                        My name is Peter Monte and I am arecent graduate of the University of Florida. During my studies I was fortunate to have realized my passion, avian ecology. In layman's terms I am most inspired byrelationships amongbirds and their environment. Such intimate knowlege of the lives of birds and their habitatshas further strengthened my commitment to wildlife conservation. This campaign helps me in my pursuit of a career in the field I am most dedicated to.This May I have the unique opportunity to participate in a pioneering shorebird habitat conservation project in the Bahamas. Combining my greatest interests (waterbirds, coastal systems, and the Caribbean), I am presented with the chance to further my career by enhancing my research and stewardship skills.In an effort toprotect beach-nesting birds, nests, and young I will be joining several other enthusiastic individualsaboard the75ft schooner Dream Catcher.I have been offered a half scholarship to participate in two of the four weeks.Cost for each week is $1,150 makingmy cost $1,150 for both weeks.This includes my bunk, onboardmeals, water, and ground transportation associated with project.Airfare and insurance are not included which willl amount to upwards of $500 for round trip airfare from one of several Florida cities to either Marsh Harbour, San Andros, or Freeport GBI Int. airports. Anything more than this amount will help cover the cost of travel stateside and any gear or supplies I may need.

Project SummaryConservian and partners will begin the first program in the Bahamas to implement on-the-ground protective and restorative measures to limit human-caused disturbance, and control invasive Australian pine at key Piping Plover, shorebird, and seabird sites.

                        I'm Mai. I am a Junior in High School and I was bitten by the travel bug many years ago until my recent international escursion to Mexico. I am officially a world traveler!! I planned to go with the class of 2018 on the school's annual summer trip out the country. This was good news..gave me time to save my money, right? Right!So here's my story...there is no Summer 2018 trip! It was recently announced that this Summer will be the last trip for my school. Bummer! I am only allowed to work in the Summer months so there is no opportunity to make my own cash and pay for my trip.This year my school is going to New Zeland, Australia and Hawaii for two weeks in June of 2017. I have six months to raise $5,700 (or come as close as I can to that magic number) before full payment is due. This cost will cover my air, lodge, tours, ground transportation and all of my meals in all three countries! Isn't that an amazing trip for an 18 year old buddig world traveler? But desperately need your help. Why should you help me, you ask? I am glad you asked! Here is why you should help me.1) I am pursuing a degree in Marine Biology and going to Australia will give me the opportunity to snorkel with a Marine Biologist.2) I am an Honor's Student in the Magnet Program at my school who gets good grades.3) I am on the school swim team and have been dedicated to the water sport for 8 years strong even landing a job at a local recreation/community center as a Lifeguard for my 2nd Summer in a row.4) I am an awesome big sister to an annoying but loving little brother.5) I'm a responsible teen-driver who runs errands for her mother and always makes cerfew.6) I've had a passport for the past 4 years and need to accumulate as many country stamps and visas as I possibly can before it expires!7) This will be an excellent cultural opportunity for me to learn neat things and bring back a wealth of knowledge to my peers.8) This is the last opportunity that I will have to travel with my graduating class and peers before I leave for college.9) I am in a single family home so our resources are limited to our ""needs"" and hand-picked ""wants""10) While some may think of international travel as a ""want"", I believe it's a need in order for one to fully mature into a global standing citizen with limitless oppotunities.Go Fund Me....It's ""Mai Last Chance"".It means that much to me. And as thank you to all of you Givers, I promise to make a donation to another fund with human or education cause at least once a year!

He is traveling to Prague immediately after we get back from Costa Rica, but he is in a little bit of a jam; he ran out of money! He has less than $100  to last him two weeks in Costa Rica, and three months in Prague.  Let's help this dude have the time of his life traveling the world. He deserves it!

HAYWARD, CA                                




Who Am I?Hello nice people! My name is WonJu Mims, and Im a 19 year old woman who loves all things beauty. I love making people feel beautiful, I love giving love, and I just love love. I see a lot a beauty in a lot of things, whether its in people, nature, art, ect. Despite this, I also see a lot of ugly in the world, and this didnt help my depression. All the horrible things that would happen in this world. So much beauty getting destroyed. I already despised living in this world because of how depressed I was. I felt I had no reason to live, that I had no purpose. I didnt know what to do, I was so lost. I thought no one truly feels this way, and that made me feel so alone. I felt I couldnt be loved because of how depressed and negative I was, so I ended up hating myself. However, all of that changed.I was lucky enough to participate in the month long summer program called Summer Challenge, thanks to my two amazing friends pushing me to do so. They told me that it would be good for me since they knew I was depressed. I doubted them, but went anyways. I ended up having the best month of my life! I found some direction, Im happier, and I actually like me. Ive never felt so loved, and Ive never felt so happy. I actually saw myself grow. It was an amazing experience. I was truly alive. I made great connections with amazing people who really inspire me to be the best me.Although, to be completely honest, its getting harder and harder for me to hold on to the things Ive learned over the summer ever since it was over. I believe I know why this is. Summer Challenge just planted the seed for me. I still need to grow, and NextGen Academy is the best environment for that. After Summer Challenge, I remember feeling I wasnt finished. I wasnt done growing, learning, making connections. I can continue that growth. That is why I truly want this, because I know everything Ill learn will stick and last throughout the rest of my life.Whats NGA?NGA, or NextGen Academy, is a leadership program that helps young adults (like me!) achieve their maximum potential by helping others. Like with Anti-Bullying/Suicide Prevention Campaigns for schools in California, as well as local and international service projects. It gives them the necessary skills to reach their goals in life, whether its something career wise or personal growth. Ill be partaking in a 10 month long journey with a bunch of other young adults with the same intentions as I!I need help getting there though. Im raising money right now for my tuition for the program. All the money will go into the program. The cost is $3,875. There is a deadline, September 15th. The program itself starts on Sept. 25th. Ive been raising some of the funds through in-person fundraising, and Ill continue to do so. Any leftover money will be used as travel money for personal expenses and such. Every dollar counts!Heres a closer look at my journey ahead of me:SEPT-DEC - FINDING TRUE STRENGTH-Breaking down our own internal barriers-Attend number of Workshops and training exercises to build internal strength and create stronger connections-Learn the practical/technical skills of project development and delivery-Fundraising campaigns to help develop public speaking, confidence, and sales experience. (sales training is essential for effective leadership)JAN-APRIL - BIRTH OF A LEADER-Participants begin to lead Fundraising Campaigns -Design and coordinate workshops-Travel to High Schools for Anti-Bullying Campaign-Plan/Develop an international service project-Go abroad to serve in various countries. implementing programs we created-Become a Successful Teacher and Event PlannerMAY-AUGUST- SHARING THE TREASURE -Create our own unique ""Leadership Program"" for young adults (design schedule, raising funds, and coordinate travel/activities)-Lead a new group of young people through ""Summer Challenge"" ConclusionThis would mean the absolute world to me. This is entire thing is actually really difficult for me since I struggle with asking for help. I appreciate you taking the time to read all of this, if you did. I know its a long read. I will be forever grateful for your help. This is an amazing opportunity for me to reach my maximum potential/become the very best version of myself, to find my purpose in life, and to share all the love that I have with others as well find true self love. Thank you!More Info http://www.nextgenacademy.org/programs/

Once in a Lifetime Trip to Europe,$160 ,"$2,500 ",Travel," September 21, 2016",3,4,HARVEST,AL,47000,1,,"






                            Gabriel M. D. Railey
                            
                            
                                                           
HARVEST, AL                                




I'm Gabe Railey. I live in the United States and my school is going to be having a trip to Europe in June of 2017, where I would love to go as I have never travelled anywhere. I am inArmy JROTC and intend on going to the Air Force Academy to become a pilot.(Me in uniform, on the left)

I am also in National Honor Society, Model United Nations, and am in Boy Scouts, where I am currently a life scout. (outdated picture of me from a Boy Scouts court of honor, middle)

Idonate blood as frequently as possible, and I helped the flood victims in Louisianna , who's houses were destroyed. (second from the left in both pictures)


I need this money to help me get there, the rest of which I will have to earn from my job. The money I earn will be used to pay for the expenses of the trip. I need to have the money by August of that year so I can have it translated into Euros, and in order to get a passport. This is incredibly meaningful to me because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and it will help me to learn more about the world in which we live. I am currently taking German, and I would also love to go to Germany because it will help me to advance my skills even more. I will be more thankful than words could ever express, and would love for this to happen so much. Thank you if you do donate, and know that I am incredibly thankful!

Help Zoria Go to England and France,$440 ,"$8,000 ",Travel," September 7, 2016",3,18,CHARLOTTE,NC,13000,,,"

CHARLOTTE, NC                                




 My name is Zoria J. Im currently a dedicated sophomore at Rocky River High School in Charlotte North Carolina. Im involved in the following extracurricular activities: Student Council, Diversity club, YCI Christian Club and Volleyball. I was also selected as Student of the Month my freshmen year. As an adventurous sophomore my stellar characteristics of being honest, empathetic, consistent, and an awesome communicator paved the way for the recommendation to The People to People International Program. This International Program will provide me with the experience of meeting new people, participating in new adventures, and exploring other cultures while enjoying and ascertaining about different segments of the world. One of my ambitions is to become a Dentist. Since the 4th grade I have always been partial to the Anatomy of teeth- if they were made of bone, or multiple tissues, and the density. As a child I always enjoyed my visits to the dentist office for my routine check- ups which my parents were confident that I would always receive a favorable report. At 12 years old I was an intern at Mannings Family Dentistry in Charlotte North Carolina where I enhanced my knowledge about Dental Anatomy. While working as an intern with Dr. Manning I observed cosmetic dental work and received obliging advice from Dr. Manning on how to operate a professional dental office. Throughout my summer months I continued interning at several dental offices while acquiring mentors which encouraged me to achieve my goals.Traveling toLondon, Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon, Oxford, Bath, Stonehenge, Isle of Wight, Normandy, Rouen and Paris for the first time will be favourable to me as I view the Eiffel Tower, and Buckingham Palace, while encountering traditional cuisine, cultures and contrasting lifestyles.As a young professional transformational leader this International adventure will provide me with an advantage for a successful admission to UCLA the University of my choice. Therefore, for me to attend The People to People International Program I need to raise $8000.00 and your generous and heartfelt monetary donations would send me on this invigorating journey.I will be departing on June 24, 2017.Your donations are tax deductible according to the guidelines of the IRS.SincerelyZoria Jones

                        My name is Caitlyn, and I'm 17 years old. I've been riding horses for 10 years now, and it has become my passion. I'm a member of the National Barrel Horse Association (NBHA), and during last year's barrel racing season I qualified for for the Youth World Championships in Perry, Georgia. Qualifying for a world competition has been a dream of mine ever since I started riding, so this is a huge accomplishment for me. As you can guess, transporting horses across the country doesn't come cheap. My parents are maxed out financially, and I have scraped together all my teenage bank account can allow, but unfortunately we are still falling short. This competition is extremely important to me, and it would mean the world (literally!) if I was able to attend. I want to make my friends, family, parents, and home state proud. A donation of any amount is extremely helpful, and greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading!

                        Hi I'm Bella! I'm planning to go on a educational tour of Japan this summer with the Tucson High Travel Club. This trip is very expensive, but would nonetheless be memorable. It's a nine day trip starting in Tokyo. In Tokyo we'll visit the Imperial Palace, encounter the city life(Different districts), the Meiji Shinto Shrine, the Inner Garden, the largest Buddhist temple Asakusa Kannon, and participate in cultural activities with Japanese students. In Kamakura we'll visit the Hachimangu Shrine, see the Great Buddha, various sights including Mt. Fuji, and end the night in a traditional Japanese ryokan.In Hakone we'll travel to Owakudani, Hakone National Park, Odawara Castle and ride a cable car up Mount Komagatake.In Kyoto we visit a Zen Buddhist Temple, the Gold Pavilion, Nijo Castle, the Inari Taisha Shrine, the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and a kimono show at the Textile Center. The trip's purpose is to educate students on Japanese culture, the language, the food, the people, their way of life. These things can only be experienced.What is an educational tour?Touching the stone walls of the Colosseum in Rome. Practicing your Spanish at a marketplace in Madrid. Working with locals on a community development project in China. An educational tour is a chance for students to experience new cities, iconic monuments and distant cultures firsthand, bringing your classroom lessons to life.I've been in love with Japan's culture for a long time now. The animation, the music, the scenery. To experience something like this, would be thrilling! I can't express how long I've wanted to go to Japan, to immerse myself in their way of life. If you'd like to see me experience something like this, please donate, anything helps. It would mean the world to me.LLAP

                        Hello my incredible family and friends!I am incredibly excited to announce that I have accepted a job offer from General Electric to join their Commercial Leadership Program following my graduation from UConn in May. I really enjoyed everything at my internship with them this past summer including the work I was doing, my colleagues, and the company culture. I am thrilled that I have now been given the opportunity to go back and start my career at such a well respected company where I can do work in the energy industry to help change the world for the better. Until I start in July, however, I am still a poor college student.Two years ago, I was lucky enough to get to spend a year living abroad in Germany, where I met so many incredible people from all across the world. The friendships and bonds I forged with these friends from abroad will be life-long, despite the difficulties we face in living far from each other. My best friend from abroad is Jack Barclay, an absolutely crazy awesome Kiwi from Auckland, New Zealand. The other students often confused Jack and I because of our similar appearance, behavior, and the fact that we seemed inseparable. Many a time our friendship was referred to as a ""bromance"". We were always there for each other through the best and worst parts of spending an entire year thousands of miles away from everyone and everything you've ever known. Jack and I also had the opportunity to backpack Switzerland together while in Europe and discovered that we are the best travel buddies.Before we parted ways 1.5 years ago to head back to our respective hemispheres, I promised Jack that I would make good use of my last college break to come visit him in New Zealand.I now need to ask your help to hold true to that promise.I would love to take full advantage of my last free month before graduating and starting my career at GE, but as you can imagine, a flight to the other side of the world isn't cheap. So please, save your Christmas, Birthday, and Graduation gifts and PLEASE HELP SEND ME TO NEW ZEALAND this winter, while I actually have the time to get out there and see the world, to be reunited with my best mate, Jack Barclay. If I can make it down, we plan to backpack around both Islands of New Zealand together for about 3 weeks. Any amount you can contribute would be much appreciated and will be used to purchase my plane ticket down under!FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY: Any donor of $50 or more will receive a hand-picked souvenir from New Zealand from yours truly.  :-)You are all incredible people who have supported me emotionally and/or financially throughout the years and for that alone I am forever grateful. This is hopefully the last time I will need to ask for financial assistance, with my recent acceptance of this offer from GE and your generosity will not be forgotten and much appreciated.With love and appreciation,Myles =D

                        My name is Ella and I am turning 13 on August 27th. One of my favorite things to do is to see shows and experience new things! I want to see Lion King in San Diego in September, but the tickets and travel expenses are a little out of the budget for mom and dad. So this year for my birthday if anyone would like to help send me to see Lion King, you can donate to this ""Gotta Go Lion King"" campaign. The paragraph above was written by us (mom and dad), as Ella is severely Autistic and not able to communite well enough to write this herself, or we would indeed have her do so.For the past year Ella has been asking ""Gotta Go Lion King"". Up until recently, we thought it was only in New York, which was not an option. So we would tell her ""Im sorry Ella, it's in New York"" Her response then became ""Gotta Go New York""!After discovering we could take her in September to San Diego, we were very excited! The only challenge is that the tickets are a bit costly in combination with the travel expenses for the three of us to go.Ella's pure joy for shows and outing like this are beautifl. This is a clip from after a Mystere show.

We would be forever grateful, as would Ella, to anyone who can contribute as a birthday gift to Miss Ella! As a child with Autismshe really gets fixated on certain things, and this is for sure one of them. She spends hours every week on YouTube watching videos, and listening to the songs. She brings us the iPad at least 3-4 times a day to tell us ""Gotta Go Lion King"".We would like to get the tickets in the first couple weeks of August toplan the trip accordingly.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Hello, my name is Andrew Kingsley and I am from Charlotte, NC. My mother is from Nigeria, and my biological father is from the Ivory Coast. The funds for this campaign will be spent on my traveling expenses to Texas, Arizona, California, and hopefully one day out of the country.The StoryI found out recently from my doctor that I have a very strange and obscure kind of cancer. It grows in very small quantities, but spreads and malignates all over your body. My family haven't been with me when I go get checkups. So all the checkups I've had have been complete favors by doctors and oncologists that I know personally. At the time im writing this, they dont even know. I need to tell them in person. Mom if you are reading this, please stay strong. I want you to live long and propserously. I can imagine what it will be like for your child to pass away before you do, but please Im begging you stay strong, for me.So far they have told me it most likely started in my prostate. After that it spread to my bladder, colon and is now seeping into my lungs, brain, and skin. It is also slowly weakening my immune system(leukemia). The good news is that I wont feel the effects of it until later on. The cancer is dormant in a stage 2 form while it spreads over my body. The bad news is that once I do feel it, it will ravage my body rather quickly.Needs/Wants I wish to travel the country, possibly even go outside the country depending on how successful this cimpaign is. I have friends from Idaho, Arkansas, Virginia, Texas, California, Alaska, and even New Zealand.I would rather live 20-21 years fully, than live complacently for 80. I dont even mind that Im passing away. As long as I dont debilitate my family with treatment bills. All I want now is to live out my final and grandest adventure.To My Loved Ones The true cure to cancer, when there are no other treatments, is immortality. We as humans have a fatal flaw in that we rarely appreciate anything until it is gone. So I could sit here and be depressed. Instead, Ive chosen to immortalize myself through this great adventure, the memories, the experiences, and the legacy I leave behind. If you are reading this and I know you, I want you to know how much I truly appreciate all the love you have shown me in my lifetime.If you ever get sad and feel like crying, look within yourself. Cry your heart out. However, dont cry because you're sad. Think of the time I have made you laugh hardest. Think of all the times we've smiled together. Cherish that memory.Most people live long lives, only to die miserably and sadly. Rather, I will have lived shortly, only to die happily and fulfillingly.Thank You.

Study Abroad in Japan ,"$1,250 ","$4,000 ",Travel," April 4, 2016",16,5,,,139000,,4,"

                        Hi there! My name is Mary Catherine Wilbur. I'm a driven animator/illustrator studing Studio Art at Lamar University in Beaumont, TXThis summer, I received the amazing opportunity to study alongside another student and my drawing professor in Japan! Our professor set up this class late in the semester specifically for us and he designed the course around our artistic goals. We're his guinea pigs to see how successful this program will be for more students next summer.About me:Technically from Dallas, I've lived in Beaumont all of my life and it's my home. I'm 21 years old, a Junior at Lamar University, and I want to be an 2D animator. My inspiration varies from Lucian Freud to Glen Keane. My favorite subjects are stories and the human reactions within them. Figures and anatomy play an important role in my work. After getting my BFA I will attend graduate school. I hope one day to be a great animator, and one day own my own studio.Why am I raising money?I am trying to raise enough funds to study with my professor at his family's home in the Miyazaki prefecture of southern Japan during July 15-Aug 5 this Summer 2016. This will be a three week program exploring the countryside of Japan, drawing on site, and developing my own body of work. We will exploreKagoshima, Beppu, Kumamoto, Tokyo, and more!My mother and I do a great job of supporting ourselves despite difficulties, but an opportunity such as the one I present to you stretches our finances to the limit. I am lucky enough to receive a scholarship that funds most of my school education. However, beyond our month to month income, there is very little to put towards outside expenses and opportunities. How the money will be used:The money will be used to pay for the housing, airfare, transportation, and tuition. The estimated expenses would be about $4000.When will I need the money?The most important payment is the plane ticket. The rest of the payments are due later in the summer.May 1: $1,400June 1:$2,600Why this is important to me:I want to be well-rounded, I want to be informed, I want to discover. My instructor is willing to take me under his wing and to push my artistic skill, and I want to take that opportunity. The art of Japan is art that I am not often exposed to in the Western World. I hope to use my experience to help me grow as an artist, an animator, and a creator.What will you get out of this?Art! I want to create something for you in thanks for your contribution. Even small contributions will receive an award. Those who donate $1-5 will receive stickers or a postcard printed with artfrom the Japan trip. Higher tiers can receive hand drawn, painted, or printed pieces. I will be making a 12-page comic (a humorous and silly one, hopefully) of my trip to Japan for anybody who donates $50 or above. Larger tiers receive larger pieces. Anybody who donates $250 or above will receive a 20-page comic based on YOUR idea, YOUR story.

PICKERINGTON, OH                                





                        Hi folks this is Gary Solomon the Host of the Laidback Bike Report . We try to bring you the best recumbent related webcast every month and occasional special reports from on location. We are so excited to have just brought Larry Varney on the show he of the long white beard and the impeccable bent credentials. I am taking the show on the road to Germany next month to the grandaddy of recumbent exhibitions known as Spezi . We plan on creating another special video report similar to our Recumbent Cycle-Con show from last September. But I won't have a group of volunteers helping me this time. Just my wife and myself to interview, run the camcorder, monitor the audio and keep people from walking right in front of the camera while shooting (it happens all the time).But as luck would have it I have received an offer to help out both behind and in front of the camera from none other than Larry Varney. But as luck would also have it he doesn't have the money to fund the trip and I certainly don't have any income from the show to cover his expenses.So here's the plan. If we can raise about $3000 before the end of March I'll use the money to pay for Larry's plane tickets, hotels, and food for 4 days to cover his expenses while at Spezi. If we can raise $4000 Larry will stay on for the next week and accompany us on our Trike Trip on the Rhine Tour. We will then create another separate video documenting our travels via trike featuring Larry's evaluation of trike he is riding and any other bent riders or shops we encounter along the way.The dollar totalamounts above are actually estimates as I can't know for sure what all the costs will be.I will tally up all the invoices and receipts after we return and take that amountfrom the gofundme money.What happens if we don't make our goal? We have decided to use all the money as a donation to Project Mobility.Any funds we collect that are over and above our expenses will also be donated to Project Mobility.Larry and I sure appreciate any help you can give us and promise to deliver the best online video coverage of our trip we can possibly offer.Thanks bent riders!

                        ITC was started in 2013 by Alex Taillie. With the support of Tiffany Madrid and Trione Vincent we successfully traveled to Spain with 9 students. Due to the success of this trip we are planning a trip on a yearly basis for students in the 38127 area. We want to provide as many opportunities to grow and expand our students horizons as possible. In 2015, we will be taking 6 students to Costa Rica for 10 days. In 2016, we are planning a trip to Paris, London, Venice and Rome for 12 days. Fundraising goal for 2015 is $25,000 and for 2016 will be roughly $25,000. It is amazing what a gift like this can do for a child. These trips are truly life changing and career defining for the adults.  Please help us reach our goals and be a apart of something big as we start to change the mind sets and goals of our students.

Hello, kind people!! My name is Bel and this August I graduated from graduate school with my masters in marriage and family therapy. The ""real world"" is quickly approaching so my plan is to run in the opposite direction and do as much traveling as possible before I settle down, find a job, and face adulthood! For 6 weeks from August 30th to October 11th(ish) I will be road tripping the United States to get to know our beautiful country. I will be on my own and doing a lot of camping and to make this trip as affordable as possible. To make the most of this experience, however, I am asking you to donate whatever you can. Any amount will be a HUGE contribution and will help me buy a tank of gas or ensure I have something to eat. It will also go toward gear I need to buy in order to have everything I need to stay safe while I am out in the wilderness.  After that I will be living abroad in Guatemala and Spain for three months! I want to spend time in these countries for several reasons. My family is from Guatemala and I want to be able to spend a meaningful amount of time with them since I have never been able to. I also want to spend time immersed in my culture to become connected to my heritage. While in these countries, I will be doing volunteer work in my field. I will use your donations to be able to get by while in these countries as I will not be earning money. I hope to use this experience to improve my Spanish so that I am able to effectively communicate and work with Spanish speaking clients when I come back and findemployment. The Spanish speaking population is often underserved in the U.S. due to the lack of therapists who can speak the language and, unfortunately, fall through the cracks too often. I hope to come back better equipped to help this population and be a positive resource for the Hispanic community wherever I live.  I am very excited about these opportunities. These trips are totally out of my comfort zone and I hope to be able to learn and grow from these experiences.Itwill in turn influence how I help my future clients as a therapist. I am determined to make these experiences happen and I hope you are able to contribute! I am so grateful to you and your support and cannot express how much it means to me that you are willing to help me have this experience. Thank you so much for reading my ramble about traveling! With so much love, Bel

Help Bring Neil Home to Baltimore,$927 ,$872 ,Travel," March 6, 2016",19,6,LANCASTER,CA,170000,,6,"

LANCASTER, CA                                




Who are you and tell me about yourself?My name is Neil Gonzalez and I'm from Baltimore, MD. I moved out to Lancaster, CA to start my IT career with the Edwards Air Force Communications Squadron as their IT Specialist.What's your story? Back in October of 2015, I decided to take up a job offer with the Edwards Air Force Communication Squadron as their entry-level IT Specialist. I'm having a hard time paying the bills here on my end with the pay that I'm getting at my job. It have been out here in CA for 5 months and it's not getting any better. The bills are getting tougher to pay and I have to keep digging into my savings to pay the rent, groceries, and other bills and necessities. I have been depressed for months, missing family andjust stressed out.What is the reason for this campaign and why should I donate to your cause?After careful consideration, I decided to put my IT career on hold and return home to allievate the pressure that I'm getting from being here in CA because I can no longer take it. I'mNOT asking anyone to donate to help pay our bills, but what I am TRULY asking is some donations to help get me back home. I am already planning to landa job once I get back to Baltimore but I need some help in having funds in my pocket to head back home and paying the buyout fee.What are the donations being used for and why are you asking for $1,800? Well, the donations are used to help pay the buyout fee for my lease at my current apartment. My lease doesn't end until November 2016and I thought I would stay at Edwards Air Forcefor a year, but with the circumstances coming up and pressure that I'm having, I decided to head back home early. As of rightnow, from March to November,the buyout fee would be $6,288. However, my deadline to reach my goal is May. So, the buyout fee until then would be $1,789. I'm asking for this much because I want to be prepared in case I would have to pay extra fees for my apartment andany other necessities that I need to pay in order for me to get home. I have already saved up $1000 and planning to sell my remaining things before departing. You work for Edwards Air Force, aren't you making a good amount of income?Unfortunately, I am not. People think that since I work for the government that I'm making a lot of money. You got the wrong idea!I'm only making $17.32/hr and I bring home about $943 (after taxes)every two weeks. My current income isn't enough to affordwhat I need to get home. My paychecks are already going to the following: Rent ($845), Car Payment ($233), Car Insurance ($110), Phone ($40), Electric ($30-$50), Gas Utility ($18-$25), Gas ($40), Internet ($47.99), Renter's Insurance ($20.57), Groceries ($100), Three Credit Cards ($25 minimum paymenteach), Student Loans ($50), Planet Fitness ($10), Netflix ($7.99). All I have left at the end of the month is about $250-$300.Why did you leave Maryland to take a job offer in California, knowing that the pay was low and taxes are there are high? It wasn't about the money. It was about getting my IT experience. For the last 7 years, I have been working with the U.S Army Corps of Engineers, making about $15.32 an hour, doing contracting work. I didn't want to spend the next five years in doing something that I didn't get my degree in. I graduated from University of Baltimore with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I enjoy being a web developer and I enjoy coding.That is what I'm currently learning at my job. I'm learning a lot about becoming a developer and the process of how everything is done. I couldn't do that while I was working at the Army Corps. Plus, I have tried looking and applying for entry-level IT jobs when I was back in MD. However, I kept getting denied, either because I didn't have the work experience in IT, I didn't have the clearance or I didn't have any certifications. So when Edwards Air Force offered me the position as an entry-level IT Specialist, I couldn't turn that down. I NEEDED that experience. When is your deadline?My deadline is at the end of May. I'm hoping to return home in May. I'mNOT asking people to donate A LOT; just small donations to keep it going and provide hope for me that you guys out there will help me get back hometo my family. I would be SOOOO happy to be home.

                        I'm never sure where to start with something like this ever so here's the ""short version"". In late 2012, I noticed some strange things happening around my digestive health and like most ""responsible"" adult freelancers living in NYC without health insurance, I ignored it. I even kept it a secret from most of my close friends and family. I changed some of my eating habits and suffered in silence because at the time, that decision seemed logical. What else was I going to do? I had to keep a roof over my head and food in my stomach even if it didn't stay there long and doctors visits can cost upwards of $300 bucks and that's before any tests. I started looking for more stable (read:Health Benefits) employment positions in 2013 and landed a freelance gig at Art+Commerce. Yup theArt + Commerce for those of us that still romanticize the inner workings of Fashion Photography and Production. I was excited and hoped for a potential long term position to open up for me at the end of my contract time in August. It didn't. I started feeling worse in the stomach area and chalked it up to stress and anxiety around not having found the right position yet and being unemployed. Then I became a candidate for what would have been, or so I thought, my dream job. I went through 5 interviews for the position only to not get the job on a technicality that had nothing to do with me. Feeling sicker and mostly under employed, I became depressed. The worst depression I've ever felt in my entire life. A ""don't leave the bed for days, what is food, isolating and debilitating"" kind of depression. Which only further compounded my health issue of course. And then a glimmer of hope came when I was approved for Medicaid (praise Obamacare) and connected with the most amazing Primary care physician. She got me into therapy right away and helped me get a diagnosis for my stomach issue within 2 months. Crohns Disease.Finally, I had a name for my symptoms and now it can be treated and I can get back to my life right? Not exactly. Doctor says ""You're going to have to make a lifestyle change if you want to get better"". Then my therapist said the same thing to me. ""If you want to get better, you have to make a lifestyle change. You're going to have to slow down."" Slow and NYC could not be further apart. So I've decided to move to the first city to ever capture my heart. New Orleans. Having been under employed for the last 6 months however, didn't exactly set me up for this decision financially so I'm asking for your help. I need to move by May 15th, 2014. Yes, I know that's like tomorrow but as the saying goes ""closed mouths don't get fed.""I was trying to make this happen on my own by selling my things, freelancing and dancing on the J train during rush hour (It's showtime ladies and gentlemen!) but even with all that, its still not quite enough to make the numbers work. I'm raising $5,000 to cover expenses like transportation, storage facilities and transitional living expenses. This move is probably the hardest thing I've ever attempted but I believe that I can do it with the support of my friends, family and community. So please contribute what you can. Any and all donations will be appreciated with profound gratitude. It also means there is one less pole for me to work on the J train.LoveUche

Bring Nathalie & Pets Home to Vancouver! ,"$2,045 ","$7,000 ",Travel," September 2, 2013",42,37,Pointe-Saint-Charles,QC,436000,,4,"






                            Nathalie Lveill
                            
                            
                                                           
Pointe-Saint-Charles, QC                                





                        Hello Friends and Community Members,

Some of you may know me, some of you may not.  I am a woman with a disability who uses
an electric wheelchair.  I am also a
Social Worker.  I have a pug named
Anabelle and a Siamese cat named Cameo.  After
13 years of living and working in Vancouver, I
made the very poor decision of moving back to my hometown of Montreal.
I wanted to move back for many reasons: 
the culture, the food, to be closer to family, to work as a Social
Worker in Montreal.  After 13 years, the lack of wheelchair and
disability access are just as bad as ever. 
It's atrocious.  I got into a
brand new wheelchair-accessible housing co-op without ever seeing the unit
itself before landing in Montreal
on July 1.  Well, the unit is not fully
WC-accessible and it will not be for at least one year.  I have been looking for work to no
avail.  I don't even have an oven or
stove.  I am currently on social
assistance and am receiving barely just enough to cover my rent.  I spent $4,200 just to move my stuff across
the country.  I am now attempting to sell
it all.  My housing co-op here is being
understanding and will likely let me break my lease without penalty.  I honestly thought moving back to  Montreal was the right
thing for me.  Now I realize that leaving
Vancouver was
the biggest mistake of my life.  I had a
great life there and I am only sorry I didn't fully realize it then.  The community in Vancouver is also pretty freakin'
awesome.  My  friends suggested we try this.  Thank you for reading, folks.  This certainly isn't easy.

Itemizing of Costs:

Moving furniture and belongings from Van to Mtl.:  $4200
Flight from Van to Mtl. with pets:  $414
Flight from Mtl. To Van with pets: $414Rent and money to tide me over until I can get a job or income assistance:  $2000

                        My name is Adam Valentine and come July I will begin my backpacking trip through most of Europe. While abroad my goal is to immerse myself in as much art as possible in hopes that this will cultivate new and exciting perspectives within my being as a whole. I firmly believe that expression is the key to unlocking ones potential, and ultimatly can change the world.So why am I using GoFundMe as a platform? Why do I need your help? Why should you care? In my opinion the best thing about this journey is it's actually not about me. I am certainly a piece in the puzzle, but the aim is to connect with the styles and ideals of OTHERS. I will be blogging about my journey and revealing the lives of those I meet along the way. You will be given perspective and insight into enviroments that are different from your own, and in return you will gain a valauble human experience with artists around Europe.Donations are greatly appreciated because like all things this does cost money. The money directed through this fund goes immediatly into my travel account and will not be used until needed. This money aids me in my quest to see impactful art! Anything you can offer would be such a huge help (even advice!!). I thank you for taking the time to check out my page.""It is only in adventure that some people succeed in knowing themselves - in finding themselves"" - Andre Gide

New Camera for TrailDamage.com,$800 ,$750 ,Travel," August 28, 2016",15,28,DENVER,CO,41000,,5,"

                        I'm Monica, and I take most of the pictures you see on TrailDamage.com . There are over 50,000 photos on the website, and 80% were taken with the same Sony Cybershot camera. We find ourselves in dusty places, and our filthy, well-used camera is failing us. It's time for an upgrade to a clean camera that takes better photos, and we could really use your help.Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS100 CameraWe're looking for a point-and-shoot camera that takes good photos outdoors from a moving Jeep. We'd like one that has a good zoom (so we can get good pictures of distant mountain ranges) as well as good detail up close (we see some gorgeous flowers and weird bugs out there). The DMC-ZS100 camera really fits the bill, along with 4K video so we can also grab awesome, panoramic shots of the scenery we find.Why Beg?The camera is $700 on Amazon at the moment, and we're a non-profit site. All donations coming from the website go to cover our Web hosting fees, and there just isn't anything left over to replace the camera. Also, GoFundMe and their funds processing service will charge us about $75 to do this campaign.Do You Use TrailDamage.com?If you enjoy the site, we'd really appreciate it if you could send a few dollars our way toward the camera. If you have any suggestions for a better camera, we'd love to hear them.When Do We Need It?Our current camera should make it through the rest of the year. It's tough to say, though, so we're hoping to replace it sooner rather than later.What's In It For You?How about sponsorship? If you donate $50 or more toward the camera then we'll happily sponsor youat an upcoming day trip. We have two more scheduled before the snow comes, at least one winter run, and then lots more in 2017. Come see the camera in person and join our group (you have to go wheeling with us once in order to join)! Sponsorship will make you a permanent member and you can go with us any time.You Count On Us, and We're Counting On YouThanks for taking the time to consider a donation, and know that any little bit helps. We know we have some friends out there in the world, and we really appreciate you and your kind words over the years. Let's keep this good thing going!

Hello everybody!My name is James Patterson and i am a student at IU Jacobs School of Music. I am creating this page because I am in desperate need to visit my best friend Peter in Vienna. If you look at my profile picture, I am on the right (with the French Horn) and Peter is on the left (with the Trombone!) I met Peter in my undergrad at Juilliard and he quickly became one of my best friends. I havent seen him in a while, and we were joking a couple days ago about me coming to Vienna to visit him. It just so happens that my Thanksgiving vacation is during the week of a very important concert for him! i decided to look at flights and i was supprised how cheap they were($450.00!!) I called my parents and asked them what they thought and they completly supported my idea to visiting him for his concert! The next day i looked to purchase a ticket,but the prices had SHOT UP TO over $800.00! As I said before, I am a college student/musician and being able to travel is extremly important to me as an artist, as well as being able to keep in touch with my friends, but unfortunatly i simply can not afford an expensive light like that.... which is why I am here! I am hoping to be able to raise the money so i can go see my friend Peter preform, and get to spend the week exploring the unfamiliar teritories of Vienna. With your help, this idea can become a reality, and i will be forever grateful! Thankyou for reading this and any contribution is HUGELY APPRICIATED!!

Thankyou thankyou thankyou!

                        Hello family, friends and everyone in between! I am a senior at the Arizona State University, working to get my Bachelors in Global Studies and I have been accepted to study abroad at Chiang Mai University in Thailand during this upcoming spring semester 2017. It was the first institution of higher education in Northern Thailand and is recognized throughout Southeast Asia for its high academic standards. The journey I am about to embark on will get me one giant step closer to my degree and reaching my career goals. I plan on going to Chiang Mai to take classes abroad to enhance my worldview and complete classes for my degree. I want to study abroad because I am very interested in learning about different cultures around the globe, the people, and the experience of traveling. I think traveling; especially studying abroad would be beneficial in my self-development and educational experience as a whole. What better way to learn than from living through real world experience? This is a fantastic opportunity but as we all know, going out of the country for any amount of time is not cheap, especially for nearly 5 months. Since this is what I want to do, I am mostly responsible for the whole trip financially, so I am looking to raise an extra $3000 for my trip. The money will go towards transportation such as my airfare and getting around Thailand, field studies that arent covered by my program fee, meals, and miscellaneous things such as toiletries and other home necessities Ill need during my time away. This time abroad will be a phenomenal opportunity and will provide me with an international experience that is crucial for a career with the U.S. State Department. I am really looking forward to this experience and with your help, I will be one step closer to achieving my goals in life. Donating any amount will mean so much to me and I appreciate the willingness to contribute to the fulfillment of my dreams/goals. Thank you and feel free to contact me if you have any questions!-Tiffani

After working six and a half years in the car industry as a website coordinator who made a living in sales and leasing vehicles here in northern Indiana (and yes cleaning snow off cars that is me on the right with my good friend James Beverly) I quit my job June 30th and I thought to myself that I should start a GOFUNDME campaign like so many others have for what I thought was down right crazy reasons. So here is my proposal to all of you. I quit my job, I'm selling anything I do not need and I'm moving to Sarasota,Florida to be close to the Gulf of Mexico and away from the snow and cold as soon as I can. Donate now and help me celebrate the next chapter in my life with a YETI 110 iced down with some Silver Bullets!!!

SAVANNAH, GA                                




We are six art students all studying different artistic disciplines. Including our professorwe make up the Brunch Club. The painter, the writer, the animator, the sculptor, the movie guy,the fashion designer, and the professor. We all share our own unique view on the arts. From coast to coast we would like to travel to the artistically abundant cities of LosAngeles and New York City to maximize our extended learning opportunities. From museums, movie studios, sculptures, fashion design studios, to the New York Times. There is somethingfor every Brunchie!Want to join the Brunch Club along through the ride? You can share in our experiencethrough our Snapchat (thebrunchies)! We will be documenting our educational trip through pictures so you toocan experience the arts in Los Angeles and New York. There will also be our friend Flat Stanleyjoining us in our trip who will be present in each photograph. The Brunch Club would appreciate all the help you can give us to reach our goal. Soplease do what you can. All of the donations will be equally appreciated. We Brunchies thankyou ahead of time for all of your donations!The WriterI have been interested in the arts for a long time. Growing up in Nebraska I had access to art, but I wanted more. I left my hometown and headed south to study art. What an amazing experience! Needless to say I have learned a huge amount, and have been left craving to learn more. Through travel I will be exposed to varied cultures and diverse ideas. Most certainly my writings will be influenced by the experience. I want my stories to connect and speak to people of all demographics. I look forward to interacting with people of different lifestyles and backgrounds. Traveling to two major cultural centers, New York City and Los Angeles, will definitely help me grow as an artist and a writer. Please help me achieve this transformation.The AnimatorI came to America from Paraguay, a tiny country in the middle of South America, so I could study art. Ive always wanted to be involved in art and in telling stories. Now I am studying film and animation so I can tell those stories. When I was 12 years old I told my parents about my dream. There are not as many opportunities for me in film and animation back home. So I studied very hard for many years in order to get the best grades. My work paid off with my acceptance to art school. Hooray!My favorite animator is Joaquin Baldwin and he is working in Los Angeles with Walt Disney Animation Studios. He has contributed to Big Hero 6, Zootopia and Frozen. He is amazing! I would like to connect with him during our trip to LA.Art school has given me a chance to study what I love and to expand my view of the world. This trip is important to me because it will give me the opportunity to explore the cultural landmarks of New York City and Los Angeles. These experiences will help me create stories that will connect people from around the world. I am here on a student visa so my travel within the United State is a limited time opportunity for me. Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated. The SculptorI have been creating art since the time I was able to hold a pencil. My creativity is blossoming as I study to become a sculptor at my art school. Art is my life passion. To nourish this passion I want to explore and experience the world. Exploration and art have been with me my whole life. As a college student I now have the ability to travel on a greater scale and with a purposeful direction. I want to see the artistic and cultural landmarks of New York City and Los Angeles.The passion of city life is found in the provocative urban art of NYC and LA. These cities have diverse ethnic and cultural communities. The NoHo Arts District in Los Angeles is filled with fantastic and amazing murals. In addition, LA is the center of entertainment that reflects its diverse cultural background. NYC displays its diversity through dramatic street art and prolific graffiti. In a wonderful way the spectrum of art in NYC extends from street art to its modern and fine art museums. Both cities are committed to their strong artistic communities. This influence will not be lost on me and I look forward to traveling to these cities of diversity and culture. Please help me achieve my combined dreams of travel and art exploration! The Movie GuyI have had a passion for movies even before attending a communications magnet school in Richardson, Texas. The magnet program allowed me access to cameras and actors and I started to pursue a career in directing. During high school I made two short films that premiered at South by Southwest two years in a row. At the same time, I sought a career in acting and was cast as a principal character in two national commercials. I now attend art school and I am pursuing a degree in Film and Television with a minor in Acting for the Camera. In this early part of my career Ive worn many other hats including: Producers Assistant, Production Assistant and Personal Assistant to the Producer. Presently I am working in the development of two feature films (The Listmaker and Supremacy.) One of the most famous film personalities also wears many hats. Steven Spielberg is an American director, producer screenwriter and editor. Also Spielberg was a filmmaker in his youth. Needless to say, I admire Spielberg and have been influenced by his iconic work. Spielberg lives and works near Los Angeles. He is closely involved with the upcoming Academy Museum scheduled to open in 2017 and which will be next door to Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). In 2012, I was honored to win the same award as Spielberg in the Houston Worldfest Film Festival as a senior in High School. In 2014 I was honored to be able to work under his wing as a set production assistant on the latest Jurassic flick, Jurassic World. LACMA is inclusive of many types of art and is on my to do list in LA. I would also be interested in visiting The Getty Center and The Hollywood Museum. The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM) Museum and Galleries contains costumes and props and might be interesting as well. In NYC I would like to visit the Film Curatorial Department at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The Cinema Image Museum and the Museum of the Moving Image would be backups.Even though Im very knowledgeable about movies and the film industry this opportunity is too good to miss. I will glean more information and details to supplement what I know and have learned at SCAD. Please help me capitalize on this chance to further my education and my path to a dream career. I will very grateful for any help you can provide. The KnitterBorn and raised in Savannah, Georgia, I have always searched for a way to involve myself in the arts. First I started studying classical ballet in junior high school. By the end of my freshman year in high school I had moved to Philadelphia to dance professionally. Unfortunately Injuries to my foot and knee told me that dance would not be a lasting career.My search for another career pathway led me back to a passion that I was always afraid to express: fashion. Hearing of my interest in fashion my grandmother showed me how to create and manipulate textiles through embellishments and knitwear. Now, three years and five collections later, Im studying fashion at one of the top art schools in the nation. Time for study and finances have limited my ability to travel. Through my computer arts class I have an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles and New York City. Traveling to the fashion capital of this country and a major textile hub will give me a wealth of knowledge and will inspire me to work harder toward my fashion career. I may not have a chance like this again. I will very appreciative and grateful for your help. The PainterAfter years in the big city rush, Ive made the jump to become an artist. Art has always been in my life but attending art school is definitely a dream come true. I would like to maximize my, maybe last, schooling experience. My new passion is oil painting, especially the paintings of the Northern Renaissance artists. Although my art school is full of resources and opportunities I would like to see the real thing. Reproductions, even of high quality, never do justice to the original painting. I believe that my learning curve will accelerate substantially by visiting top rate museums.Presently I have an opportunity to travel with my computer arts class to Los Angeles and New York City. Theses cities are filled with art and art museums. The Getty Museum in LA has paintings and drawings of major Northern Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer, Rogier van de Weyden and Dieric Bouts. I would also visit the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. LACMA is another great museum that has many departments and wonderful exhibits of fine art. In NYC I can expand my interest in painting from fifteenth century art to modern art. I hope to visit the great museums of NYC such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met). Both these museums have impressive works of Modern Art featuring artist like Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Edward Hopper and Andy Warhol. The prospect of going on this trip is very exciting to me. Needless to say, I will be very grateful for your generosity to help me achieve this travel and educational opportunity.The ProfessorMy teaching career sprang from a lifetime in advertising, graphic design, digital media, film, fashion and fine arts. In helping young artists develop their talents I discovered I was drawn to teaching. My passion now is presenting traditional and innovative art theory and digital techniques to inquisitive college students. I believe that the travel opportunity the Brunch Club has created goes beyond supplementing their college experience. It is my hope this extended learning opportunity will inspire them to evolve and expand their creativity as artists.

                        Hello everyone! My name is Elisa Feliciano & I have created this fundraiser to raise money so that I can go on a 10 day tour to Israel with my home church, Calvary Temple International in Wayne, NJ from January 31, 2017 - February 9, 2017! We will be traveling through Pilgrim Tours travel agency ( http://www.pilgrimtours.com/ ). I am praying for a financial miracle that I will be blessed with the opportunity to go to this beautiful event because the Lord has put it in my heart to go visit Israel. I have been praying for my home church to go to Israel for almost three years. Now that this opportunity have come my way, I am praying for the financial breakthrough to go to this once in a lifetime trip. I want to walk in the footsteps that my Jesus had walked on. I want to experience seeing & being at the places where Jesus Christ had walked. The price of this trip including airfare, hotel, tour guide, taxes, gratuities, lunch & dinner is $2,609.00. I have to put the first down payment amount of $300 with a photocopy of my passport by October 21st to Pilgrim Tours in order to reserve my spot & I have to pay the balance before the end of November 30, 2016. So far, I only got $100 from two people that blessed me with $50 each & a $5 Go Fund Me donation from an anonymous donor. I really appreciate your help very much, even if your donating $1, $5, $10, or whatever you can. Anything counts. Please help me make my dream trip to go to Israel with my home church a reality for me. Thank you & God bless you.

It is a nine day trip that take us all around Germany visiting famous buildings places and cities, and it really sounds awesome.

I'll be so grateful no matter how much you are able to donate. So please everybody help me make my goal. Even if you can't donate, just share it for other people to see. Help me make senior year as memorable as possible, thank you!

Hi Everyone! My daughter and I have been chosen out of 3500+ applicants to move to Cape Breton to work at a unique market called Farmers Daughter Market!! 
Please have a listen to the radio interview I just did with CBC to explain so much more and CTV News covered it as well on their website as did local news.
We have decided to go on a crazy leap of faith to better our lives mentally and financially. This is a min wage job so not moving to get rich but rather more affordable living as we have struggled to even put food on the table for far too long.
Elementary school bullinging for 5 yrs has driving my daughter to such deep sadness so with no friends being left behind she is already at the door with her bags packed! 
No 10 year old should have anxiety attacks going to school!
We are both over the moon for this amazing opportunity, to be given a chance at a clean slate. Small family oriented community, a job and affordable living is exactly what is needed to happen asap to save my daughter!
I struggled as a 100% single mom for 11 yrs now with zero child support and it's time to be happy!! (No reciprocal to go after child support in the Netherlands) So we shall leave this crazy rat race where even as a mortgage broker I still can't make enough to get by! (Never had extra funds to market myself so 10+ yrs I lived purley based off referrals. Thank you to all my clients for trusting me!!)
Please help us with any amount you can spare to help us on our journey. 
We have movers to move us across of 6000+ km and we shall drive on our own heading out next Friday Sept 16th, 2016 so very very quick!
The expenses to relocate is incredibly expensive, almost 5000 just for the moving truck! But we must do this or we shall simply rot here.
Please help us with any amount you can spare!!! 


Thank you All and know that any amount is extremely generous and appreciated!! 


See link below for radio interview. Press play at the top and go about 16min in and wait for it....

Send  this  dramaturg to  Uganda!,$950 ,"$3,500 ",Travel," September 14, 2016",16,11,FLOURTOWN,PA,1100,,5,"

                        So... I'm the VP of Grants  and Awards for  LMDA (the Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas.) A few days ago I emailed a theatre artist to ask her to apply for a grant. She responded  with an invitation to  the theatre festival she curates, the Kampala International Theatre Festival in Kampala, Uganda. http://kampalainternationaltheatrefestival.comWhy go? Firstly, this invitation literally dropped  out of the ether, and I believe that  when  an opportunity  appears  out of nowhere - you are meant to take it.Seconfly,I would like more people to know about LMDA and the work we do. I would like to learn how theatre is created and presented in a culture very different from the one I live in. I would like to participate in an exchange of ideas about theatremakiing in East Africa and the USA. What cultural position does it assume in each of out cultures? Why make theatre? I want to go as an act of allyship- to try to create a more peaceful world through mutual understanding, the level of understanding that can only be achieved by meeting face to face. I want to begin to lay the groundwork for an international organization of dramaturgs, working together in an atmosphere of mutual aid and support, and I want to investigate the possibilities for long-term collaboration between LMDA and the theatres of East Africa.While the festival is from November  23rd-27th ,  my travel plans must be finalized and submitted to the festival organizers by  October 15th.This is my chance  to not only visit the cradle of civilzation, but do so  in the service of the two things I love more than anything in the world -- Theatre and  Travel. I can write  about how grateful I would be. However , words aren't able to express my gratitude . I know  in my heart that this  would a life-changing experience, and that  this is the moment in my life for it . The person you donate money to now will be a better human upon his return.Why $3500 dollars? Well, a plane ticket is a  thousand dollars . The Sheraton in Kampala  is  of equsl price to one in Tampa , or Portland , or any mid-sized American city at $168 a night, or just over  800 dollars for 5 nights . I'd want to get there  a day or two  early which is another  320 dollars. The  plane ticket  that costs  has a 19 hour layover in each direction ,  so I would end up taking a day  in Dubai in both directions. Although the hotel would be  free, Dubai  is not and I've never been  and would want to experience it.  I'm waiting  on a estimate of my costs  while in Uganda, but I have some needs that other people don't .  I have Cerebral  Palsy and  an elevated hemidiaphragm. I don't walk well ,  or breathe that well either.  Because of this , I will need a car and driver to get anywhere. Frankly , I'd be happy  with anything you can  do. Thanks for listening .Warmly,Brsd Rothbart

                        Those who know me are aware that I dont get impressed easilyIt takes something pretty unconventional or nonconformist to trigger my interest. Cowspiracy triggered my interest. Why? Because I had never seen so much consciousness, awareness, and logic all at once in a documentary. (If you havent seen Cowspiracy, its a documentary about animal agriculture and its immense repercussions on the environment, the economy and the health of all animals & humans) There was an immeasurable amount of compassion conveyed through a medium, film, that I thought was exclusive to entertainment purposes. But I was wrong. Filmmaking can also educate, enlighten and propel. Conscious filmmaking can shed light on current issues and help raise the level of awareness of individuals.And thats what Im aiming to do. In Hawaii. For 3 months.I have been selected to follow a group of top sustainable living students in their incredible journey to design a semester long program in consciousness, sustainability, and Hawaiian language and culture.I, with the help of my camera, will be documenting the whole process, from contemporary native Hawaiian issues discussions, to first-hand tropical ecogastronomy and permaculture design. The fundraising part has just begun. I need to raise about $5200 CAN (US $4000) to pay the program fee & airfare by its due date, August 15th. If youve ever felt like making a concrete difference without having to travel in the African Jungle, now is your chance to donate towards a beautiful cause: educate humanity on how to get back to our roots.I am looking forward to showing you the footage. Mahalo to all of you who take the time to donate (no matter the amount).Tara, xoxJe viens d'apprendre l'excellente nouvelle que j'aurai l'opportunit de tourner un documentaire  Hawaii sursur la durabilit environnmentale pour l'Universit que je frquentes.

Si cela est une cause qui vous tient  coeur ou vous dsirez tout simplement m'aider, n'hsitez pas  soutenir mon projet, quelque soit le montant, le geste est profondment appreci.

                                                Ridding an Electric Unicycle (EUC) has become a serious passion of mine. In the last 6 months I have accumulated 2800+ miles (20-25 a day).Riding has changed my life. Being a lazy overweight homebody, is probably how most of you who know me saw me.In the first months riding I had gone down 15lbs and started feeling much better then I had in a long time.

SAINT PAUL, MN                                





                        A Lakota Familys Journey to United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous IssuesHau, mitakuyapi (greetings, my relatives),Today, indigenous peoples are authoring a powerful story that advances an extraordinary, sustainable alternative for the future of our world. The wisdom of this collective story endures a time when indigenous peoples and communities face their most daunting and dangerous challenges. Regardless of the adverse conditions, our indigenous relatives continue to offer rays of hope to a world in trouble.Its within this positive light that members of our Lakota Tiwahe (family), once again, plans to participate in the 15th Session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York City. The theme of this years forum Indigenous peoples: conflict, peace and resolution aligns well with our humble mission for world peace: to nurture and embrace new relationships one relative at a time. Peace is an innate light that warms the homes and communities of indigenous peoples throughout the world  whether it be in the arctic, in the forests, in the desert, upon ocean islands, upon the plains, or in the mountains. A sense of relatedness given from the source of extraordinary indigenous peoples can contribute to peace anywhere, unlike anything we have seen before. We are looking to be in New York City on May 9-14th to help, in small part, unify the worldviews of indigenous peoples and our respective efforts to achieve world peace. The overall event occurs from May 9-20, 2016.Picture of AIM-West delegates with Indigenous Brazilian and Uruguay delegates (2015)Dear relatives, we humbly ask for your support so we can successfully make it to New York City. This year, the combined costs for food, lodging, and travel pose an immense challenge for our five-member delegation. As a delegation with approved observer status, our father, who is board chair of the American Indian Movement Interpretive Center, will represent the hereditary obligation of our family to protect the validity of the Lakota Nations 1868 Treaty, a supreme law of the land document to which our Sicangu Lakota great-grandfather was a signer and designated enforcer; our mother, a participant in the Indigenous Womens Global Caucus, who has devoted more than twenty years to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women; our sister, a 2016 Sundance Film Institute invitee and 2016 Knight Foundation Fellowship recipient, will capture the concerns and efforts of indigenous delegates through imagery and video interviews, and participate in events associated with the Global Indigenous Womens Caucus; and us (Thorne and Wakinyan LaPointe), who are college students aspiring toward degrees in international law, will represent youth interests in the Global Indigenous Youth Caucus, engage the broader cross-section of indigenous change-makers in other venues, consult with international legal experts, and lead on-the-floor presentation to the forum, as necessary.Today, climate change and global warming call upon us to contribute to a more collective future of sustainability, reciprocity, and co-existence with Unci Maka (Grandmother Earth). Indigenous peoples wisdom and knowledge hold the key ingredients to recovery and survival. As the oldest living nations, we have maintained our intimate connection to the land and water since time immemorial. We have stood strong amongst the eldest nations of the world in this respect. Today, this truth has the potential to help all people incorporate Unci Maka into their worldviews, to inform more sustainable interactions and decisions at all sectors and levels.In return for your support, we will host a community dinner upon our return to inform local supporters of what transpired at the Forum, provide electronic updates of events as they unfold, make a final report available, and keep you abreast of the newly conceived and indigenous-centered Mni Wakan: Decade of Water summit.The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, states in Article 25: Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other resources and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations in this regard.AIM-West delegates with Madam Chair of UNPFII 2014, Dalee Sambo.We respect your consideration of our request for support. Contributing to our journey to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York will help us to further enrich our contributions to Unci Maka, the indigenous world, all communities, and the protection of water. http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdfPress Releases: https://www.sundance.org/blogs/artist-spotlight/meet-the-2016-knight-foundation-fellows#.VsUe1v4QKMA.facebook https://www.sundance.org/blogs/program-spotlight/6-indigenous-filmmakers-premiering-their-films-at-the-sundance-film-festival http://consent.culturalsurvival.org/nancy-bordeaux-historical-trauma-unpfii-2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkSVS9Wc78&feature=youtu.be http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/resolution-united-nations-permanent-forum-indigenous-issues-study-act-racist-derogatory-demeaning-propaganda-indigenous-people/ http://firstpeoples.org/wp/tag/wakinyan-lapointe/ https://issuu.com/culturalsurvival/docs/csq-fa14_383_final_web/11?e=0%2F9114203

Will Schmidt's Canada to Mexico Paddle!,"$9,180 ","$30,000 ",Travel," April 18, 2014",82,29,LAGUNA NIGUEL,CA,1000,2,4,"






                            Will Schmidt

                        Aloha, My name is Will Schmidt. I am a former United States Marine, an advocate and survivor of debilitating depression, as well as a pioneer of open ocean, long distance and endurance stand up paddling. My journey started in 2012 when I became only the 6th person to solo stand up paddle the Catalina Channel of Southern California from Avalon, Catalina to Dana Point, CA, a distance of over 40 miles.In addition to this achievement, in September of 2013 I solo stand up paddled the inner California Channel Islands Chain from Oxnard, CA to Dana Point, CA consecutively to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. I covered a distance of 225.6 miles, crossed 9 channels, and landed on 6 islands. Escorted by a 34' Catalina sailboat, we set 5 stand up paddle world records within the span of a week. On May 24th, 2014 I navigated a SIC F-16 stand up paddleboard solo and largely unassisted from Neah Bay, WA to Swiftsure Bank in the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Canadian/US border) and paddled south 1386 miles to the USA/Mexico border fence in Border Field State Park, Imperial Beach, CA. The voyage lasted 61 days total with 58 days of actual paddling. I surfed to the shore and touched down at the border fence at approximately 6:45pm on Saturday, July 26th, 2014.Two firsts for stand up paddling were achieved on this successful attempt. I am the first solo and completely unassisted stand up paddler to navigate from Canada to California as well as the first solo and largely unassisted stand up paddler to navigate from Canada to Mexico. During the California coast portion, I was escorted from land with a safety car however completely solo on the water itself. In addition to the 1386 miles paddled, I logged an approximate 1.1 million paddle strokes and averaged 3850 calories daily. My median mileage per day topped 28 miles. The farthest distance I traveled in a single day was 42 miles.I paddle as a brand ambassador for SIC, Oakley, Nemo Equipment, Carapace Wetsuits, Astral Designs, Black Diamond Equipment, Swiss Barefoot Company, and the Wounded Warrior Project. I continue to seek donations through this crowdfunding site to benefit active duty and veteran US service members suffering from post combat anxiety, depression, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.Any and all proceeds from this venture after reasonable expenses will be donated to the Wounded Warrior Project.Feel free to visit my website,  www.AreYouInspiredYet.com, and click on the banner to watch my Channel Islands documentary film.

                        Hi. My name is Tom Walls (referred to as GMN* above) and I am goingto walk across the United States. It is a decision that was made after a great deal of thought and quite a bit of soul-searching. Approximately seven years ago I returned home after working abroad for a year and a half. And though I know that was the right decision for me at the time, I have spent the last seven years strugglingwith self-doubt, depression and a general lack of direction in my life. Sometime during the spring of 2015I decided that if I wasn't able to move forward personally, professionally or emotionally, that maybe it was time to move forward physically. That decision has brought me here. I will step out on the road; I will go in search of my destiny because I've waited long enough for it to come to me.I will start on May 1, 2016 inBoston, MA and will walk along US Rt 20 to South Bend, IN. From South Bend I will head SW until I pick up Historic Rt 66. Rt 66 will be my path until I reach the Grand Canyon (which is actually just a bit north of Rt 66). From the Grand Canyon I will walk in a SW direction again and end in San Diego, CA. I expect to walkover 3200 miles and take almost a year to complete.Though I have been working hard to save for this trip, I am pretty sure it will require more funds than I will be able to accumulate on my own. That is why I am asking for outside assistance from family, friends and kind, generous strangers. Any amount you can donate will be appreciated immensely. Donations will be used for food or equipment I need along the way, emergency medical expenses should they arise, and any other unexpected expenditures. I am going to be as frugal as possible but also want to be prepared. I dread having to end before making it all the way across the US because I ran short of funds. That being said, any money I receive from people through GoFundMe and that is not used by the end of the trip I am planning on donating to charity.Thank you very much for taking the time to read about my campaign. If you decide to donate, know ahead of time how much I appreciate your generosity and aid. Though I will be updating my progress here, you can also follow me on Facebook or at http://thegreatandmightynobody.blogspot.com/*GMN means The Great and Mighty Nobody. It is a moniker I use when I write. I think most of us are GMNs. Just normal people (nobodies) who are all great and mighty in our own way.

                        Hello Fellow Berners & Democrats,My name is Alex Dominguez, Member of the Democratic Party of Milwaukee County Executive Committee. Not only have I been a long time community activist, local election coordinator but a Bernie Supporter, NON-STOP. My good friend, State Assembly Rep. Jonathan Brostoff (D) (Milwaukee) and myself have an opportunity to go to Philadelphia, PA to the Democratic National Convention. Not only was Jonathan the first WI State Legislator to Endorse Bernie Sanders, but he is an official Delegate for the DNC, and even helped Secure Bernie a Super DelegateWith all the campaigning for Bernie and helping him Win states like ours, we now need a little help from not only our friends, but Bernie's friend's as well. We are just a couple of working stiffs and while being able to attend the Convention in Philadelphia is a great honor, it has it's drawbacks, namely it's ridiculously expensive.If you can find it in your heart to send two dedicated Berniecrats, we can help shape the party platform for a more inclusive democracy that promoted clean money candidates, fights for the raise in the minimum wage, and ensures the voice of the 99% is louder than the 1%. We look forward to seeing you in Philly and THANK YOU!

TEXAS CITY, TX                                





Hi! My name is Clarissa Rodriguez and I am 17 years old and the youngest Democratic National Delegate, in the state of Texas(in represention of Bernie Sanders). In recent months, I have become extraordinary involed in politics. Recently, I was elected as a National Delegate at my state's Democratic Convention, by my Senate-District. I will be attending the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, from July 24 to 30. visit my website here!Considering the fact that I am from the Texas City, Texas, I will have some rather large travel expenses. - a flight from houston to philly, cant be cheap. I am trying to raise money in order to pay all and any of these travel/stay expenses that come with being a National Delegate. 
The goal is 3500 dollars, because all state and national delegates have to pay for their own way to Philly. Now that I have secured the National position, in my district, I only have roughly one month to raise enough money to attend. This is urgent and so exciting!
To add some background, I can tell you my mother works incredibly hard for what we have -which may not be considered much. She has worked hard her entire life. She raised me to be passionate and kind. That passion has brought me to this: wanting to represent a lot of people, like my mom: who makes just above minimum wage , my father: who never really recovered from addiction, my step father: who recently passed due to cancer/liver syrosis and all others who have not been represented well enough in our system. I care deeply about the shape and status of the Democratic Party and The United States. And yes, I hear often that it is unusual to find a person my age so anamored by politics, but I care passionatly about what happens to us, not as 'democrats' or 'republicans', but as people. I am trying to raise this money, in order to take the burden of paying for this massive trip off of my mom. I would greatly appreciate if you would help me do that. I am in the position to represent so many people and I can tell you even by giving the smallest donation, you would still be helping us a great deal with any travel and hotel cost for the Dem. Convention.
Thank you,
Clarissa (: 


If you would like, there is more information on the trip and expenses here (national): texasdemocracticconvention.com 


why so is national convention stay so expensive? - they place national delegates in a certain hotel to make sure they are accounted for and safe.

                        As a paramedic for over 30 years, Carey has dedicated his entire life to helping others. As a community, I believe that it is time that we help take care of him. For the ones that know Carey personally, you know he is not one to ask for help, even if he needs it. In April, Carey started having issues with his heart. The issues caused him to pass out and during one of the episodes, he fell and fractured his spine. A pace maker was placed to help with his heart issues, however, he is still in the healing process and has begun physical therapy to help with his spinal injury. As of now, the expenses have been overwhelming and with not being able to work, it has placed a tremendous amount of financial stress on him. Carey is not married nor does he have any parents, siblings, or kids to help him. We, as his friends, are asking our community to help our friend in any way you can. No gift is too small and if you are unable to give a monetary gift, we ask that you keep him in your prayers and pass this information along to your friends and family. We thank you in advance for your help!

I have been invited to travel Mexico City, to help with the promoting of the sport at a regional level.Any donations will help make this happen for the benefit of wrestling.Olympic wrestling has been around since before 708 B.C. It originated in ancient Greece where it was part of the Olympic Games where young men and soldiers would battle one another to show their strength and skill also to keep them combat ready in time of war. Now, in modern time where wrestling is still an Olympic sport practice by millions of people from around the world, including countries such as, U.S.A, Iran, Russia, Mexico, Cuba , Columbia, and many others. In the Olympics they compete in three different styles freestyle, Greco Roman, and women's freestyle.Promoting the sport of Olympic wrestling is vital and necessary to the sport's survival. My goal is to incorporate various unique cultural aspects with Olympic wrestling on T shirts as one of the main ways to promote wrestling at a global level.I got Involved in wrestling at the age, of 15. Even though I faced a couple of challenges I kept my passion for the sport. First, being wheelchair bound because of a mild case of cerebral palsy which does not enable me to fully walk. The second had to do with me being Native American. I was stereotyped because I wrestled with long hair and I was being labeled as disabled. When I wrestled I learn to think differently than most people and had to be creative. Wrestling has made me very strong mentally. It has also helped me with strengthening my legs, and increasing my leg mobility. It's important that I share my experience with others so that they can learn how to fight through adversity and learn about the way wrestle will mold an individual. This is where my purpose and desire to travel Mexico comes from.Mi nombre es Mitchell Miller. He sido invitado a viajar la Ciudad de Mxico, para una clnica de lucha libreLa lucha olimpica ha existido desde antes de 708 A.C. (Antes de Cristo). Se origino en la antigua Grecia en donde formo parte de los juegos olimpicos, en los cuales hombres jovenes y soldados luchaban los unos a los otros para demostrar su fuerza y destreza. Tambien luchaban para alistarse para la guerra. Ahora, en tiempos modernos en los cuales la lucha sigue siendo un deporte olimpico practicado por millones de personas alrededor del mundo, incluyendo paises como EUA, Iran, Rusia, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, y muchas mas. En las olimpiadas se compite en tres diferentes estilos: libre, greco romano, y libre femenil. Promover el deporte de lucha olimpica es vital y necesario para que el deporte sobreviva. Mi meta es incorporar varios aspectos culturales unicos de la lucha olimpica en camisas para empezar a promover la lucha a un nivel mundial.Me involucre con la lucha a los 15. Y aunque he enfrentado cirtas dificultades, he mantenido mi pasion por el deporte. Primero, estar en una silla de ruedas por paralisis cerebral lo cual no me permite caminar completaments. Segundo, porque soy un nativo americano. Y fui esteereotipado por competir con pelo largo y por ser discapacitado. Cuando empeze a luchar empeze a pensar de forma diferente, y me hizo ser mas creativo. Luchar me ha hecho fuerte mentalmente y me ha ayudado a fortalezer las piernas, e incrementar la movilidad de las mismas, Es importante que comparta mi experiencei con los demas para que puedan aprender a luchar contra la adversidad y aprendan de la forma en la cual la lucha puede moldear a un individuo. De aqui nace mi motivo y deseo para viajar a Mexico.

                        Oaklee was born August 26th 2014. He was born early due to complications in the womb. Initially, he just needed periodic help to breathe and to eat, as he was only 4 lbs and not born at full term. Today, he is 5 days old and now requires medical help from a special team in Ottawa, Ontario. Oaklee is a sick baby and needs his Mommy and Daddy to be close by. Oaklee's Mommy and Daddy don't have the funds to stay in Ottawa with Oaklee. His Mommy needs to be there to continue to pump and breastfeed Oaklee and his Mommy and Daddy need to bond with Oaklee. They need each other. We don't know how long Oaklee will be in Ottawa. His Mommy and Daddy need help to cover the costs of travel, food, and hotel stays for the whole time Oaklee has to be in Ottawa. Please help Oaklee and his family. There is no greater gift in this life, than life itself. Please donate. Any amount is greatly appreciated. This is a real family supported by a team of professionals in our Community. We are doing whatever we can to help support Oaklee and his family.

"Don,GreenDemocratsForBernieDelegate","$3,750 ","$4,000 ",Travel," June 27, 2016",138,3,EUGENE,OR,787000,9,13,"






                            Donald StClair GreendogDemocrats
                            
                            
                                                           
EUGENE, OR                                




PLEASE READTHE UPDATE* BELOW FIRST! I'm Don St.Clair, and I have been elected to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia as a delegate for Bernie Sanders! Each of the 1900 of us Bernie delegates represents 80,000 to 100,000 voters!I am involved in creating a historic first ever Climate Change Council/Caucus at the Convention to join the more tradition identity caucuses such as Labor, LGTBQ, Latinos, AfricanAmericans, etc. I am also going to Philly to continue organizing the emerging Green Democrat (or Green Dog Democrat) wing of the Democratic Party, espousing the four key pillars of the global green movement: ecology, social justice, grassroots democracy and non-violence. For clarifications purposes: I believe thatorganizing a Green Dog* Democrat (*Democrat,OnlyGreener)withinthe ""Big Tent Coalition"" of the Democratic Party is the best way to bring these key values into the American political mainstream, just like the ""Realo"" pragmatist wing of the German Greens became coalition partners with the ruling Social Democrats and were able to leverage their power to implement the stunning advances in Germany of ecological sustainability, free college, etc.

*Update as of Thursday July 21st, 4 days to the convention:FRIENDS! I HAVE AN URGENT PROBLEM around cash flow. If you are about to donate to my gofundme, would you message me via the email to Don link here on GoFundMe INSTEAD? My funds are being transferred via ACH to my checking account, but they will not arrive until about Tuesday of next week! So, I am scrambling to solve the cashflow problem so I may pay for the airline ticket and other expenses that are part of the very expensive process of attending a political nominating convention. The Sanders campaign has only had limited success in fundraising for their delegates and has only paid a contribution of $377 direct to the hotel bill (splitting a room but they are super expensive). My Oregon state party, which is NOT a highflying party of fatcats in the slightest, say even being frugal, a national convention costs about $4000 to attend!(Our exemplarySenator Merkley lives in an ordinary nice suburban house and his wife still works as a nurse, and our state director is a former in the trenches community organizer out of the Howard Dean movement, not a lobbyist type, and except for a few officeholders and about five staffers, almost all of us in the Dem Party Oregon must have day jobs or other support, in my case, SSI disablity.) Yes, Democracy needs some help levelling the playing field, and that is just what Bernie has done and continues to advocate for and what we will fight for on the convention floor! So... By hook or crook I will be getting on an airplane no later than Sunday to be there for Sunday night's first delegation meeting, but I am needing to call in any and all assistance to make that happen. So please if you are able to, contact me. Thank you! End of update, please continue with my profileI am the co-founder/director the Green Democrat Organizing Project, which is establishing several organizations similar to groups like MoveOn - a 501c3 or 4 educational membership group, an affiliated Political Action arm, and eventually a think tank policity institute for bringing the deeper global green political perspective into the mainstream of American political discourse. Weseek to unite natural allies for progressive victories - the future is and must be blue green! Think green, vote blue, dig in for long term revolution and change from within is our mission.We are looking for a volunteer web designer right now for that, please contact me directly.Personally, I am an activist, a healer, a musician, a writer, parent of a 17 year old daughter and step-grandparent of a 1 year old bundle of joy! I am the vice chair of the Environmental Caucus of the Democratic Party of Oregon, and as such havethe lofty sounding title of Party Leader/Elected Official (PLEO delegate). Leadership means, we serve everyone - you! Each delegate represents 80,000 to 100,000 voters for Bernie Sanders. We need your help to get to the convention,where every vote will count, and every voice will be needed to continue the revolution and Bernie Sander's vision, and unite to defeat Donald Trump in November and create a Brand New Congress down ticket!So I must humbly ask your help. It is $4000, for airfare, hotels (we must stay in one designated one particular one, in this case 30 miles away in King of Prussia, we get credentialed every morning at 7am and bussed in through very tight security to the arena), meals, expenses. I also need to pay for expenses like child care for my one year old baby granddaughter, whom I am a primary caregiver for as she lives with us, and I need a few necessities of an organizers life I lack: a smart phone and a functioning laptop. I am seeking donations of items like those and frequent filer miles transfers as well to fly round trip between Portland Oregon and Philadelphia. I need to raise the funds in the next two weeks!I seek to unite natural allies for progressive victories - the future is blue green., Think green, vote blue, dig in for long term revolution and change from within is our mission!I am most grateful for your assistance and will post many possible perks and videos and what have you.You may vette me to be sure I am an actual official delegate by going to the Democratic Party of Oregon's website at http://dpo.org/2016convention,and at http://www.fundberniedelegates.com/Thank you!Don St.ClairEugene, Oregon

When I complete the POWER of SEVEN project, I will be the FIRST WOMAN to climb the ""Seven Summits"", the tallest mountain on each continent, for the purpose of raising awareness and research dollars to fight Breast Cancer.      

My first ""Climb to Fight Breast Cancer"" was in 2004 and since then I have climbed five of the ""Seven Summits"" and raised over $70,000 for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wa. My goal is to raise over $100,000 for FHCRC.org

I've lost four close family members to cancer, a number of friends and I have one sister who is a survivor.  Each climb honors those lives lost and brings hope to others.

My next climb is Mt. EVEREST, the tallest mountain on the earth and my personal expedition costs are $65,000.  It is a daunting figure and this is where I need your support.  I thank you in advance for your help and generosity!

Donations of $50 or more... 
I will carry a NAME BANNER to the Summit of Everest.  If you have someone special you would like to honor and add to the banner, please let me know their name when you make a donation.

Follow the Journey! Support the Cause!

As many of you know, I am a HUGE fan of ULTRA Music Festival in MIAMI. This will be my 14th year attending and marks my 2nd year moderating the facebook group. I admittedlyhave put in TOO MANY hours running the group, making sure it is free from spam and trolls. It has been a lot of fun but it has also stolen a ton of my time. I am hoping that some of the friendships I've made will inspire people to be generous and help me make this trip possible.





Normally March is an abundant month for me but this year I am financially ""running on fumes."" I have spent the last 2.5 months recovering from a broken ankle which has kept me from working. In this time I have used up all my reserve cash and now with my trip to Florida right around the corner my credit card bills are looming. I will use this money to pay for the flight, ticket, lodging and food for during the trip. It would be the best birthday present if I got a great response.



I will be eternally grateful to everyone who helps out and would LOVE to meet up with you and take some photos at the festival. Thank you so much for your support. <3

                        Hey All!! My name is Amber Rosenbaum. My husband and I have been managing a supported living site for the past 6 years. We assist 3 gentlemen with developmental disabilities; ages 61, 45, and 20. If you live local, I'm sure you have seen us all over town!! A little known (alright, probably well-known) secret is that we have been planning and saving for the past 2 years to take our crew to Walt Disney World for the vacation of a lifetime! The reservations have been made and we need to be paid in full by September 1st, 2016. We will be staying in a hearing accessibility suite at Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We are planning for 5 days in the parks, to allow plenty of time to see all there is to see!! We plan to explore the sights and sounds and of course ride a few rides!! We also want to afford the gentlemen the opportunity to return to the hotel in the afternoon for down time and the option to return in the evening for fireworks!! The package we have chosen includes most meals, and special character dining experiences to really make this trip special!! We are hoping to provide the FULL Disney experience, so this is where we need your help!!! Our youngest gentleman has been with us for the shortest amount of time, and financially is unable to contribute to the trip, so time is running out and we are running a bit short. We are all for one-one for all in our family, so no one gets left behind! This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity for these gentlemen. We feel extremely grateful that fate has brought us to serve these men and we want this to be the most magical experience they have ever had!! We are looking to you, our facebook friends, family, and neighbors, to assist us in making their dreams a reality!! Even if you cant help monetarily, share this with your friends and family and let's make this happen!!The words ""Thank You"" do not truly express the gratitude we feel towards anyone who can help us make this trip a reality. We PROMISE to take lots of pictures and flood your facebook feed throughout the trip, so you can see for yourself how much this means to our crew and what a difference you have made to them!

She was able to travel to the U.K. Where she got to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, ride the London Eye, see the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, Big Ben & Parliment, Enjoy some time in Hyde Park, take a Thames river cruise, ride on a double decker bus, tour Salisbury Cathedral, explore roman bath's and visit Stone Henge. Soon she will be traveling to Germany for two weeks and in the future she hopes to visit Hawaii and see a volcano, travel to Iceland to see the Northern Lights & visit the blue lagoon, go to Ireland and see the Giant's Causeway, visit the colosseum in Rome. She also hopes to see Niagra Falls andNew York City and much more.Help us make her dream come true. Thank you!

                        Hello my name is Carmela and I am 23 years old from Mexico City. As you can see from my tittle of the account, I am a huge soccer fan and my dream has always been to attend a World Cup tournament. I want to see if I can raise about $5,000 to cover for the expenses, as things can become very expensive when you include plane ticket, hotel, tickets to the game, meals etc. My guess is that the trip will cost about 10k, but I can finance the rest. I will be keeping this account updated as it grows with videos and fotos. Thank you.Hola mi nombre es Carmela tengo 23 aos de edad y soy de la Ciudad de Mxico. Como pueden ver en el ttulo de la descripcin, soy una apasionada al ftbol y uno de mis sueos siempre a sido apoyar a mi seleccin en un mundialde ftbol. Me gustara acudir al prximo mundial e hice esta cuenta de Gofundme para ver si puedo recaudar fondos monetarios para financial una porcin de mi paseo. Si me pueden ayudar con lo que sea se los agradesera mucho. Los mantendr informados con updates de como se desarrolla esta campaa con videos y fotos. Muchas gracias.

Howzit spirit fam?As many of you know, I have been living in Hawaii for the past 9 months, teaching special ed math at a charter school in a rural district on the Big Island.My sister Kaitlyn was recentlymarried to a lovely Portuguese fellow named Bruno and I have decided to embrace the unknown and join them for their celebration in Lisbon, Portugal.I took the little money I had saved and put it all toward a multi-destination ticket: Chicago to Lisbon on Monday, June 1st and Amsterdam to Hilo, on Wednesday July 29th. It cost me$1,758.30.In between these two points on the map, the unknown awaits. I have no definite itinerary and am offering my gifts, stories, and experience wherever the wind blows. In Hawaii, we call thiscruising. Letting go of expectation or plans, and moving freely and in the moment, at your own speed.Learning to love mystery instead of fearing it allows me to be strong in my vulnerability. It has taken a lot of practice to jump into uncertainty!I am offering a chance to support a nobel adventure in the art of hospitality. So many times I've hosted travelers and been blessed by the gift of giving. I also have recieved more generosity that can ever be repaid from the hospitality of countless hosts. If you are so inclined, please join me in this grand experiment.

NERO Live Action Role Play Camp,"$28,350 ","$15,000 ",Travel," January 22, 2016",124,8,MOUNT GILEAD,NC,668000,,4,"






                            Joseph Valenti
                            
                            
                                                           
MOUNT GILEAD, NC                                




My name is Joseph Valenti. I've been the owner of NERO Live Adventure Games, the premier Live Action Role Playing (LARP) organization in North America, since 1998.In February of 2015, I purchased a two-parcel 81-acre old farm in Mount Gilead, NC. I have been slowly improving the site and developing the property into a Campground Resort to produce LARP Events year-round!I am asking the community for the help tobuild this site into a Campground Resort. The site will be used for weekend-long LARP events for NERO and possibly other LARPs as well. Our goal is for a mix between a murder mystery theatrical experience and a medieval bed and breakfast. Event attendees play the characters in a medieval fantasy adventure game, acting out the action bysolving mysteries, overcoming challenges, and defeating adversaries using foam swords and sorcery.NERO currently has about 35 active NERO LARP Chapters and 3 LARP Affiliates operating in America, Canada and South Africa, with around 4,500 active members - with new players joining all the time!NERO chapter staff are all volunteers who donate their time, effort, and love for LARP to help entertain the rest of the players.Here's a recent video about NERO and LARPing, featuring NERO Highborn in Illinois:MORE ABOUT LARPLive Action gaming is a growing hobby with tens of thousands of active LARPers in North America and Canada! - with even more around the world!European copuntriesare regularly holding large LARP events with attendance as high as 10,000 in some places, and long events lasting 5 days or more days long! Here in America, foam fighting societies have annual events with 500 to 1500 attendees. Some medieval reenactment groups focused on living history are holding week-long events with 5,000 or more attendees!HOW THE FUNDINGWILL BE USEDThe money raised in this campaign will be used to offset the cost of improving the site into a NERO LARP campground resort.As of March 15 we have 1 10' x 20' building, and several trails running 250' long with several 50' diamter round fields blazed out of the back woods.We're building and bringing in pre-made cabins over the next year while producing tent and cabin based NERO Events.I plan on accomodating attendees with real bathrooms and shower buildings that will be built throughout the year. We will also build a square Castle with 72' of wall and 16' feet of gate on each side (88' total each side), and we have 400 2 x 4 studs already on site to start building the Castle. Will place some of the cabins inside the Castle.The tall forest needs a small amount fo clean up and it can accomodate large battles against the towns adversaries, like the Weeki South Goblin tribe whose king has yet to appear to save them, that lives in the forest and is targetted for eradication throughout the first year.We have tor down oe of two old 12x16' sheds and are rebuilding it until april 15,2016, and we will replace the next in the weeks following that. We have an old 30 x 30 house that we'll tear down and replace with a lodge building for event-staff by the end of year 2016. In 2016, we'll build a 12 x 16 building and another 12 z 16 for Monster Camp, by end of May 2016.And there are three old barns  small, medium and really-large - that we'll replace and make part of the NERO LARP Campground in the next few years.That's a lot of stuff!Thus far, I have thus far spent hundreds of hours and lot of my own money on the property and its development, and in creating project plans and drawings, and getting quotes for all the different work that will be done.I have met with electricians, engineers, building builders, the health department, the building department, the electrical department, excavators, council-members for the local youth groups, the town mayor, commissioners and managers, about our NERO Campground Resort.I have a 5 year goal to be a site that will accommodate 1,000 or more event attendees in tents and cabins. I've starting land clearing and will build or have delivered buildings to eventually accomodate 200 people in Cabins and 300 peopel in Tent Sites.We'll develop the remainder of the site throughout the next five years to accomodate more and more attendees until we can accomodate 2,500 people.This initiative means the world to me, and the entire NERO LARP membership. I have spent 17 years developing NERO Game system and opening NERO Chapters, all the while looking for a permanent site.I feel thatNERO deserves a first-class gaming site - one that all members of the LARPing community can be proud of.We've got the chance now to revolutionize Live Action Role Playing - and take it to the next level of quality and immersion using this property in the perfect location.The site will serve as the primary site for theNational NERO LARP Events in March and September of each year, and it will also be a NERO North Carolina Chapter, which I will directly manage.My appreciation and gratitude to the LARPing community for helpingto develop this siteinto a LARP-based campground is beyond words.Beyond being in my heart forever as a HERO, to show my appreciation, I'll engrave every backers name on a general plaque of some sort that will be located on the site upon a 'Wall of Recognition', depending on the amount you pledge, so that supporters who visit the site will see our 'THANK YOU'.See Below for Our NERO LARP Websites and Social Media Pages.Thank you for your support!Joseph Valenti

                        It has always been my dream to travel to India. On January 29 to February 19, 2016, I have this amazing opportunity to join a pilgrimage to India and Nepal. I will be joining a group of people who will be visiting a variety of sites related to the life of the Buddha, and meditating in different Vipassana centers. I have saved enough money for the airfare to and from New Delhi ($2000). I need to raise $2,000 more to cover the rest of the pilgrimage expenses (pilgrimage fee which includes accommodation, meals, guide fees, entry fees, transportation, as well as visa fee, travel insurance, etc.). I hope you can donate to help make this happen. I will be sending you lots of Metta or thoughts of lovingkindness :-) Rest assured that I will also be performing more good deeds to pertuate the cycle of giving and receiving in this world!Here's the link to the pilgrimage as organized by Pariyatti: http://www.pariyatti.org/Pilgrimage/tabid/267/Default.aspxYou may also donate directly to the Pilgrimage fund of Pariyatti for volunteers/scholars like me: http://store.pariyatti.org/Give-a-Donation_p_4397.htmlThank you very much!With lots of love and aloha,Carmen

                        Hello Everyone!My name is Gabby Scrofano, student, runner, hiker, rollergirl and I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail this summer. A walk in the woods might hardly seem like an expensive endeavor, but as I have come to find it is pricier than my two part-time jobs can handle. But I bet you're asking yourself, why is this something that I should support...Most of us have dreams, goals, aspirations, but something happens called life - you get a job, have a kid, get married, have an unexpected tragedy then all those dreams fall by the wayside. I don't want that to happen, so I am taking action. I am going to do something that I want to do - make memories, learn about myself, reconnect with nature, and refocus my direction in life.Unfortunately, between gear and covering expenses while I'm gone is a little more money than I currently possess as a full time student. I am asking for your help so that I can complete one of my aspirations. If donating money doesn't float your boat I would love if you could help me buy a few specific items or if you have backpacking/camping items that you would like to donate. (If you are interested in this option please email me)I still need:  - Extra batteries  - Fuel for my stove  - Cookware/utensils**I am registered at REI (Registry Number: GR128599585)Anything will help, I will be sending postcards along my journey to those who contribute to my trip. If you need any more convincing here is a video of the majestic Appalachian Trail.

                        Here's complete honesty. I dont want this bike. I want to put on my shoes, goout thedoor and run the trail. Well, thats not an option for me and i'm not going to dwell on it. I'm going to do the best with what i have and how i ""run"" the trailis with this bike.I had a bike and it changed my life...seeing things, going places i never would have without it. It got me off the pavement. My plan was to sell it so i could upgrade to a new version, but then life happened. I had to buy a new wheelchair, which took most of the money and had to use the rest for life and hospital bills and such.So here i am without a bike. Having tasted the freedom it gives me, it's hard to imagine my life without it.

What will this bike enabe me to do?1. Be me. its in my DNA to get out on the trail, beach, mountain by myself2. Sweat. I'll be able to get a cardiovascular workout off the pavement, out on the trail.3. This new bike has a power assist so i'll be able to keep up with my friends!4. Explore places i've never been5. Ride in the sand and snow. I'll be able to run fat tires with the new version!6. Run with my new dog (when i get him/her)What are my plans with the bike?-My usual is Los Peasquitos Canyon in San Diego. I grew up exploring this canyon as a kidand it carries a pretty strong nostalgia for me. Its nice to get a cardiovascular workout, out of the gym, off the pavement. I like to sweat!-Ride the bike park. Its no secret that i'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie and i love riding the Mammoth bike park with friends. Its such a freeing feeling!-Long multi-day bike packing. Here's where things get serious. I like to challenge my soul and with this cash i plan to also round up all the gear i need to bike into the backcountry solo and carry everything i need with me. Now THAT's exciting!I will use this thing for my own sanity and to inspire others. Please be a part of this!Here's what the new bike looks like:

                        Greetings, I am Fran Rossi Szpylczyn and I humbly seek your help today. In 1991 or 92, I first learned about the Camino de Santiago, and dreamed of going. My dream seemed to get lost along the way. It got found! Here I am in 2015, planning a September 2016 pilgrimage. My camino dream means not only walking ""The Way,"" but also documenting my experiences in a book for others who ""lose"" their dream so that they may be encouraged to ""find"" it again. Thus - ""walking in hope."" This is very much a trip launched from a base of faith. My dream was rediscovered in talking to a friend, with whom I will journey. Her words to upon hearing my many worries and objections were, ""Pray, plan, relax. God will take care of the rest."" There are numerous reasons I can't ""afford"" this trip, but there are far more reasons that I can't ""afford"" to try to respond to God's call to pilgrimage. It is difficult to write this, but it is always hard to ask for help and to rely on God, and the goodness of people - but to do so is to take my first wobbly steps on the path of the pilgrim. Why $3200? I am not exactly sure of all my costs to be honest. Right now the planning figures are about $1600 for airfare, $1600 for the trip. This is a place to start. I will be 100% transparent with my costs; expect a breakdown to begin to appear, from transport, to pilgrimage expenses, to supplies. If more money is donated than what I use in the end, I will donate that money. If you would consider a donation to help fund the journey and my book, I would be immensely grateful. I will also be taking as many prayer requests with me as my heart will hold - meaning as many as you ask for. God bless you for whatever you can do. No donation is too small - or too large! :-) Thank you for helping me to find ""the way."" Thank you for helping me to ""walk in hope.""

A.D.A.P.T Level 1 Parkour Coach,$460 ,"$4,500 ",Travel," January 6, 2016",10,8,876,,505000,5,16,"






                            Kamari Lewars-Smith
                            
                                                            on behalf of Verona Clarke

876                                




THE MISSION

To send two local free runners, and a chaperon to Mumbai, India on March 3h until March 8th in order to participate/attend the first-ever fitness conference that is dedicated to showing the power of training barefooted, where they will experience barefoot workouts and workshops, as well as small nerve training, and much more with scientists and fitness experts from around the world. COST:

Three Plane Tickets from Miami, FL - $2308.70 + Reservations (Subject to change)Three 2-Day Course Tickets - $275 US eachCommuting- $654 USFood and Accommodation - $890 USTotal: $4,677.70 US

THE GOALThe ultimate goal for this year is to build a Public Parkour Park/and or a Freerunning Gym in Jamaica to promote the holistic lifestyle of parkour to the community, and to help Jamaica better understand and appreciate the discipline as an art form. Along with proper health and fitness, the parkour lifestyle is about openness, togetherness, and playfulness. The parkour philosophy also touches on mental liberation from the current situation a person is in, to their goal in the most efficient manner, it allows us to believe that ""obstacles are opportunities"" - Ramon Murray.

FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY

In order for the government to truly take these boys seriously and help with the building of a public parkour park, it's best that they get some additional international experience with parkourand what better way than toattend a Barefoot Summit in India?! They already train barefoot in Jamaica anyways.

There will be a 2-day workshop held in Mumbai, India on March 5th until the March 6th that costs $275 for each ticket:

Barefoot Training Summit: Mumbai, India

The cost of airfare to go to New York on the best available flight between the 19th and 30th is$435.90 each.And so a total of at least $4500 USD is required to send these two boys on this journey to better their community, their country, and their region at large.WHAT IS PARKOUR?



Parkour is simply a lifestyle that has an ongoing principle of ""How can I most efficiently get to my goal?"" Person's who practice parkour are called traceurs (female: tracuese) which is a French word that literally means tracer, or free runners. Most persons recognize free runners as the people who flip on the road and jump from buildings to buildings, but there is so much more that goes into it. To be a traceur/free runner, is to be a person who is constantly training physically and mentally, as all the proponents of the human body have to be up to par in order to keep in line with the ongoing principle of efficiency. PHYSICAL FITNESSA traceur/tracuese has to condition their body to facilitate fluid movement and to keep the whole self at an optimal level. Theyhave to live a holistic lifestyle to keep up with health and fitness. In doing so, they will need to have an extensive knowledge of how their bodies work in order to manipulate external influences to maintain efficiency. Any person who trains parkour can attest to the vigorous training and failures, but have had to stay focused on the goal and push through the failures in order to become a better version of their selves. This in itself is a vital life skill everyone needs to possess: to know that the pain is temporary and success is right there all you have to do is go out and get it.

You are your biggest obstacle.  Ramon MurrayMENTAL STRENGTHParkour isn't like sports where there is a winner and a loser. The whole ideology behind it is that the competition is with ones self. ""How can I be a better version of me?"" - NOT ""How come that person is so much better than I am?"" The first and foremost goal is to become a better person than you were when you started out. Put yourself on a higher level so that you can have a more efficient life. This sounds great, but how do traceurs even do this?

Take, for instance, JOEKA, who was actually diagnosed with psychotic depression, meant to be on medicine for the rest of his life, but he said NO, he wasn't going to be the bottom of the card pack and be forgotten. He trained parkour religiously, for a few months, and in no time the doctor reduced his dosage until he was completely off, and now the only medicine he uses is exercise.WHO'S THATJOEKA?

Most people as kids would do cartwheels, climb on monkey bars, and jump on trampolines. If as children we more susceptible to danger, why is it then that the majority of adults are scared to even do a cartwheel? Its all a battle with the mind. We tell ourselves that we can't but in truth most people physically are very much capable of doing a cartwheel, but mentally are incapable of the action. This is a hurdle traceurs have to tackle every day, we have to do something about the parts of our lives where the only thing holding us back from a better version of ourselves is our self. Traceurs use the little accomplishments to tell ourselves we are capable of the bigger ones in our life.

The more you get done, the more motivated you are to do things. - Tom Connellan

BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY



Its our intention to integrate the community into the construction of the park in order to create a sense of responsibility in the minds of the community members to preserve the park.

The parkour park will provide the members of the community with a place to train and condition both their bodies and minds to adapt to different obstacles.

The park is also meant to draw attention to the community for other organizations to pitch in and assist in building up the community.

The two boys that we want to send to New York are Kingstonians, who were mentors on a project last year called Run Free.

Project Run Free 



Project RunFree engaged many of the youths within the Downtown community, and garnered a positive response that provided the youths with an initiative and a drive. This park is aimed towards making that drive and initiative feeling and effect sustainable.

BENEFITS OF PARKOUR TO THE GENERAL PUBLICCompared to other athletics, parkour provides an avenue for movement, and play that mostly vanishes once children age out of playgrounds. It resonates with older children who dislike team sports, but are not yet old enough to enjoy other non-competitive athletics like cycling or running.

Parkour requires no specialized equipment or facilities, it can be practiced virtually anywhere, making it accessible to low-income populations who often lack access to traditional athletic programs, or gyms. Lastly, parkour fosters a love and appreciation for the built urban environment, and again an overall mindset of seeing obstacles as opportunities.

Larry and Janet 'Missy' Iams have been building an 1880's western town for six years now, which is 75% completed today. Their goal is to preserve a piece of the American old west history, and share it with the world. When completed, their proposed accommodations and activities will include, and definitely are not limited to: a hotel and log cabin, dance hall and saloon, billiard hall, gun fight reenactments, old-time photography, stagecoach and buggy rides, chuck wagon dinners, dances/classes, weddings, private parties, a movie set, mounted shooting, and old-time barber hair cuts and shaves. Just imagine being able to push back time and be fully submerged in the wild wild west!Seethe town in all its glory in this interview done recently by KRQE New 13. Check out this special storyHERE! Over the last six years, Larry and Missy have almost single handedly built the entire town. Now, as they are getting up in years, they could use a helping hand so they can finish it off and open it up to the public duringtheSpring andSummer seasons. Thus far, building the Town Of Gabriella has cost approximately $25,000. Below is an list of materials and merchandise needed to complete the town:2,500 gal. water tank - $3,000Water pump- $250                            PVC pipe- $250Higher walls, roof, & flooring for the Dance Hall-$3,645 Flooring & ceiling for 3 bedrooms & dining room for the Hotel- $6505 gal. of stain for all flooring- $80Propane water heater- $500Septic tank system- $2,500Bath house- $3,2004 Cabins: 40'x16' total- $3,710Gravel for our entrance dirt road- $5,000.         Miscellaneous small buildings materials- $340Pool table- $200Cast iron stove- $500Aladdin lamps- $975Trim- $200With the cost of materials plus the cost of labor, we estimate it will take $50,000 to have the town up and runningby Summer 2017.If you've had the pleasure of metting Larry or Missy, you know how loving and caring they are. Their kindness and generousity truly knows no limits. To see their dreams come to fruition is a victory for the adventure seeker, the artist, the history buff, the traveler, and anyone who likes to have fun!Any donation, whether it's a dollar amount, sharing on your social media, or lending a helping hand to be a part of creating this attraction, is appreciated beyond words.

                        Three years ago a dream started deep inside me when I cameacross a 1991 Volkswagon Vanagon, dead in the backyard of a rental property. The van, soon to be known as, ""The MOONTOWER,"" had a wonderful early life traveling with the Greatful Dead untill 1995, then turned adventuremobile and travel 205,000 miles of the country, until finally parked in 2011 and sat unloved for two years.I bought the brokedown Moontower for just $500. Over the next year completely restored the Vanagon to a live-in home. Complete with high efficiency appliances, run fom 100 watt solar power system. Many hours, blood, sweat and tears went into complely replacing the drive train (Motor, transmission, fuel system, coolent system, ect.)After the rebuild, I said goodbye to the ""normal life"" and join the VanLife community in hopes of spreading the word of a simple life, to steer people away from the material destruction that the world has become. The Moontower and I traveled the country together. He was my companion and best friend over the next two years. We travel to Arizona and he transported many pounds of gems and minerals. He got me deep into the bush of the backcountry, and when I needed a place to sleep, he was there for me. He took me to the lowest point on in the country (Bad water Death Valley: -282 feet) to the highest place in the country (Mount Whittney summit: 14,508 feet). He took me to 15 national Parks including Yosemite to climb on El Capitan. He helped me live, he helped me shine, he helped me to become who I am today.On Wednesday, August 3, 2016 the Moontower took his final breath. As I pulled into Grand Haven State Park to have a day of paddling, the engine blewout and ignited gas and oil (I had just, one hour before, done a complete maintenance check). I tried to put out the inferno with the fire extiguesher with no luck. Within five minutes, the whole van was engolfed in flames and burned to the ground. Everything burnt, my home, my place of peace.....GONE!!!!!With the Moontower's demize, I need a new love to continue the journey! Estimated loss of $30,000 included base van $12,000, conversion $8,000, and lots of love spreading gear $10,000.If this story touched you in anyway and want to show support, anything is a blessing. Please share this story of adventure and light.

                        Ciao!! That's about all I know in Italian (beside gelato), but I'm hoping to be fluent by the time I leave! I am ready to say ""YES!"" to the adventure of my life! I've been dreaming of this my whole life and it is time to live out my dream! It is time to stop talking about it, and it is time to make it happen! I believe we all should make our dreams happen, and I'm not going to let anything stop me, even if it resorts to begging. ;) Why Italy?I've always felt drawn to the Italian culture and the country before I ever even stepped foot in it. Perhaps it has to do with maybe having some ancestry there. (My grandmother was adopted; we don't know her background and I've always gotten mistaken for Italian.) When I studied abroad in London my junior year of college, I visited Rome and Venice, and from the moment I arrived, it felt like I'd been there before. I couldn't explain it. It was just ""home."" Why do I want to go?I've always been an adventurer and I've always listened to my gut. My soul is telling me that it's time to go! After my recent breakup, I knew that this was the perfect opportunity to go. I knew that it was time to begin my book I've been dreaming about writing and to go live out my own ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" but I hope to do less eating, more healing, definitely writing, and for sure, LOVING! I believe we all should follow our hearts wherever they might lead, and mine is leading me to the hills of Tuscany! My plan is to write and finish my book over 3 months as well as soak up the culture and just spend time with ME. My plan there is to truly LIVE! I have written over the years about truly enjoying life and I feel that this is MY time! You might be wondering why so much money is needed?Of course you are! For the record, if I want to work in Italy, I need a Visa and the only way to obtain one is by being hired for a specific trade by a company. I have no companies hiring me. ;) I am going to continue to do online work to earn a living while there, but I truly want to focus on healing, loving, and writing. The goal that I'm trying to reach covers my expenses both here in the U.S., and in Italy. Why should I donate?Well, that's an honest question and I understand why someone might ask that. We've all been supported at different times in our lives, whether financially, emotionally, or physically. At this point in my life, this is my opportunity to be able to chase my dream and why wouldn't I do everything possible to make it happen. Although I hesitated to create this page, at the end of the day, I listened to my heart and well, here it is. I plan on posting video updates on a regular basis so we can experience this adventure together! Please understand that your love, positive wishes, and prayers mean just as much to me! Thank you for being in my life and thank you for being part of my journey! I'm so very grateful for you.Grazie!Shari www.sharingwithshari.com~ changing the world one smile at a time ~**MOST PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BE REDEEMED WHEN I RETURN FROM ITALY UNLESS OTHERWISE ASKED AND AGREED UPON BEFOREHAND. PLEASE INQUIRE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

                        As a newly married couple, we were excited to have our baby on the way. We imagined our first few weeks as a family together would involve strolls through the neighborhood and sharing precious moments with our friends and family at home. Instead we began our lives together in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Jen was already in the hospital on bed rest for three weeks when a tiny baby came into our lives. She was 14 weeks earlier than expected and at just 29oz, we were more scared than either of us had ever been. She had our hearts before she was even born and when we saw her face, we knew her name was Saffron.Not even 24 hours after she was born, her lung was accidentally punctured and collapsed. Her lungs were already weak due to being born as early as she was, and the doctors and nurses told us to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Deep down we knew she'd make it- she just had to.Time passed, and thanks to the dedication and skill of the neonatal medical staff, Saffron continued to grow and become stronger by the day. Saffron reached a major milestone a month later and got to come off of the ventilator, a major hurdle. This one is a fighter!Two months after she was born, we discovered that she had retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). If we wanted to save her sight, she had to be moved to a different hospital and be put back on the ventilator. After a few weeks of uncertainty, the laser surgery on her eyes was deemed a success. After three months in the NICU we were allowed to leave the hospital as a full family of three! The medical insurance helped us with this lengthy and massively expensive four months in the hospital, but this was just the beginning of our adventure.Days after we came home with our family, Robin lost his job. We knew we had to find income quickly but we also knew that the job market was lacking in Montgomery, Alabama. He reached out to a friend in New York and within days Robin had a job in Manhattan! We had no savings and no income, so we sold our car to move. With no choice but to turn to credit cards, the debt began to grow- but we were in New York and we were together! Flat broke and with no insurance, we arrived only to be greeted immediately by a horrible respiratory infection known as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). This can be deadly for preemies and we were so frightened. Saffron had to go back in the hospital, but this time Robins new job was so understanding and accommodating. After a week in the hospital we were allowed to go home and give her daily breathing treatments. She made it through the RSV but has been very sensitive to lung issues ever since. Luckily, as of today, she appears to be growing out of it!Even though we were doing everything we could to cut corners and stretch to make ends meet, we were getting deeper in debt. The decision was made to move to Red Hook, a cheaper area in Brooklyn. Just a few months after the move, Hurricane Sandy came and devastated our new neighborhood. We fled to Hartford, Connecticut after getting the mandatory evacuation notice only to be hit with the brunt of the storm. After being trapped there for over a week, we finally returned to Brooklyn only to find our apartment was not habitable. We were forced to couch surf for a couple of weeks until our apartment was deemed safe- but even then there was no nearby grocery and the area was going to take a long time to rebuild. It was no place to raise a baby. Moves aren't cheap and we were not prepared for this financially. Robin went to his boss and asked if we could move to a different state where they had another office. We knew that NYC was just too expensive for us and that our mound of debt was only getting worse.We were approved to move to Atlanta, and we jumped on the opportunity. After only a short time, we know we love it here. The unfortunate realization is that we are paying about the same as we were in NYC, and our debt continues to grow. Saffron has been back into the hospital since we've been here, and we have also had unexpected medical problems come up of our own. Even with insurance, the deductibles have added up, and our medical debt continued to climb. With all of the looming debts, we decided it was time to get out of this situation once and for all, and that drastic measures needed to be taken to adjust our lives. Last week we did something we never thought we would have to do. We filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy. While the majority of each paycheck will be gone, in five years time we will have paid off 100% of the debt that has been bearing down on us for so long. Its time to downsize and cut costs. Were selling everything. Were moving out of our rental property and getting a little motor home. Robins work agreed that he can work full time via internet, so we will live on the road. We were already planning on homeschooling Saffron, so this will only give us more opportunities for learning hands-on! Were finally taking these lemons and making some lemonade! This is where you come in. The second-hand motor home costs $10,000, and we hope to raise the money with your help. Please consider making a donation to our House On Wheels Fund. However big or small, your help will enable us make this change and provide a consistent, warm and safe home for Saffron! We plan on sharing this journey with you all through updates on Facebook and we hope to start a blog once we get the RV. Thank you so much for all of your love and support!!

Rock Girl:  On the Road,"$26,950 ","$50,000 ",Travel," May 9, 2015",153,16,NEW YORK,NY,363000,1,42,"

NEW YORK, NY                                




Rock Girl on the RoadSince 2009, Rock Girl has trained young women to be advocates for themselves and their communties. Rock Girls have worked with artists and architects to make Safe Spaces benches across South Africa, they've met with local leaders to discuss the rampant violence in their communities, and they have trained with professional photographers and radio producers.Now, Rock Girl is taking it on the road.In June 2015, we launchedRock Girls On the Road to take teenage girls from South Africa on road trips across the country to meet other girls and document their stories. On their return, they produce a radio show for the national radio station, a photo exhibit, and short films about what it means to be a girl in South Africa today.On our last two trips, we brought girls from Manenberg and Gugulethu Townships, violent and gang-ridden neighborhoods, on a 6-day trip up the coast and one our second trip we headed to the Kalahari. They met girls from similar environments and shared stories with one another. And they explored their own countrysleeping under the stars, feeding elephants, eating new foods, and swimming in the Indian Ocean for the first time.On their return, they shared their findings about the state of girls in South Africa with the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, prosecutors, police, and magistrates, and the media. They continue to advocate for lasting solutions to the challenges girls face, and are mentoring the next group of girls.Most importantly,Rock Girls are broadening the circle of sisterhood.These girls are brave.In Manenberg, where most of the Rock Girls live,girls dodge bullets on the way to school. Many are dealing with PTSD and secondary trauma.For the last five years, Rock Girlhas given them a safe space where they can experience their curiosity, intelligence, resourcefulness, joy and strength.Rock Girls advocate for:* Access to free, quality education from grade 1 to grade 12, and beyond, including transportation to get there safely.* Reproductive health care from an early age* Freedom from all forms of sexual, domestic, and physical violence in their homes, schools, communities, and jobs.We areembarking on our third roadtripin October to the Rustenburgarea where Medicins sans Frontieres estimates 55,000 girls are raped each year.

This time, we are traveling in our very own BRAVE bus, which we purchased with your support. It is outfitted to be a mobile recording studio and a safe space for girls to meet.

Every dollar you contribute supports these young women as they become activists and advocates for themselves and for girls across the country.$1,200 covers the entire cost of one Rock Girl's travel for 10 days$500 will pay for the group to camp in a nature reserve.$250 will cover one days food and supplies.$100 will provide park and museum entrance fees for the group.$50 will cover our daily internet fees so we can update from the road.$100,000 will purchase the overland vehicle and customize it to serve as our mobile office and travelling radio studio.PLEASE DONATE TODAYYou can make a big difference in their lives.Experiencing other cultures, different languages, new foods, and more importantly, new perspectivescan be a life-changing experience. For many of the Rock Girls, it's the first time they have traveled beyond the city limits. After our last trip, the Rock Girls created a charter and helped girls establish Rock Girl support groups in their own communities. After meeting young women in Bredasdorp where three young girls were raped and murdered, they helped create a bench to memorialize them and to call attention to the safety of girls and women there. And now, they are mentoring a group of young women for our next journey.This is where you come in. These young women have been supporting themselves and one another. Please help us widen the circle of support. Your financial contribution, no matter the size, can help change the trajectory of these girls' lives.Risks & ChallengesThese trips are a big undertaking. And a big responsibility. We have received incredible support from the local tourism industry. Africa Travel has subsidized the rental of an overland vehicle. Guides, scientists, and rangers are donating their time to be with us. Several hotels, hostels and game reserves that have offered discounts. On board we also have a trained facilitator, radio producer, certified medical support, a professional driver, and an award-winning filmmaker and photographer. Join the Rock Girl CommunityWe are committed to amplifying the voices of these powerful and brave young women.Make some noise for Rock Girl on social mediaShare this on Facebook and Twitterto expand the sisterhood.Thank you!India Baird, Founder - Rock GirlSue Jaye Johnson - Partner - Rock Girl

EVANS, GA                                




From my son's Instagram post on July 20th....My name is Mark Maxwell Mioducki and today is my first day riding my bicycle across USA. I will be going coast to coast from Savannah, GA (Tybee Island on the Atlantic) all the way to San Francisco on a route I mapped out myself. I have had this desire for almost two years and it has taken me over a year of working to save up and prepare for this. I will be camping where I can and trying to accomplish at least 50 miles a day on a bike with roughly 100 lbs of gear/supplies (not including my own weight)...fast forward to the afternoon of July 31st when this trip was suddenly derailed by a senseless act of violence by a crazed motorist that apparently doesn't think he should have to share the road with bicyclists. He tailgated Max honking his horn and then tried to run him off the road. At which point Max yelled at him that it was the law to give him 3 feet leyway. This angry man followed Max to a gas station and seeing Max's bike laying in the grass while he was nearby by making a phone call the driver jumped a curb in his truck and purposefully and deliberatly ran forward and backwards over the bike. Max didn't want to ask for help to make this trip but this unfortuate event has caused him to reconsider and he is now asking for your support. It will cost him at least $2000 to replace his bike and gear and we've been told this most likely will not be covered by the driver's insurance (if he even has it) because insurance companies do not accept claims for malicious distruction.Thanks to all that have expressed a willingness to help and please know how grateful both Max and I will be. He will need to order a bike which may take up to a week so it may be that long before you see trip updates.Share the road! Watch for riders of all varities.

SAN ANTONIO, TX                                





                        Marine Mom and Fellow Highlands grad needs your help. Dolores Gutierrez (class of 1986) is a hard working single mom who has fallen on some difficult times. She has a wonderful son, Jeremy, who is going through Marine bootcamp in California and her daughter just started college locally and unfortunately she recently lost her job. More than anything else she would like to attend her son's marine graduation in early November. Being a marine mom I know what an accomplishment this will be for Jeremy and how important it is for both of them for her to be there. Her kids are everything to her and if you know her then you've probably heard her say this before. I am not a big proponent of Go Fund Me campaigns, but this is something really important. The amount I am asking for on her behalf is just to cover her expenses for airfare, modest hotel accomodations and meals for her to attend family day and graduation and return home with her son. He will be home for a short visit and then off for more training (away from home) to prepare him to serve his country and protect our freedoms at home and abroad. Please join me in helping her reach this goal so she can make plans and purchase airfare while the rates are still reasonable. Any amount will help. Sorry the photo is sideways, but I couldn't get it to show both of them in one frame. This is a picture of the day he was sworn in to serve in the Marines.  Please feel free to share if you are a fellow classmate or marine mom.Sincerely,Darla Pundt

                        Stephen G. Zapasnik was KIA in Iraq on 24 December 2008. Unfortunately, due to prices, his family has not been able to visit him since his 20th birthday. I talk to them frequently, and I have personally been to Arlington National Cemetery to visit him on multiple occasions. I would like to raise money to help fly his family to Arlington, put them up in a hotel for 4 days, rent a car, and have money for food and drink expenses. No family should be deprived of visiting their sons resting grounds. Regardless of the reason. I figured at MOST the total cost for each of their flights would be roughly 300, hotel 250/night, and rental about 150 per day. Again this is based off ""at most."" Then another 2-300 for food for each day. In the end, it will be just shy of 4000 dollars. The reason I am breaking it down, is because I want everyone to know that every penny will be going to the family. They deserve to see their son/brother. Please feel free to facebook message me or e-mail me for any questions what so ever. Zap was one of my best friends, his family has been welcoming ever since his passing. They modified a pool house at their house for Zap's brothers/sisters in arms to stay in, if they ever wanted to visit. This is the most deserving family of good deeds that I have ever met. Thank you all!

This is our daddy. When the whole family lived together he was a 220 pound hot tar roofer, hauling shingles up and down ladders all day. He used to pick me and my sister up - one in each arm and carry us around the house as if we were feather light. Him and mom would lift us up with their feet on our bellies, holding our hands so that we could pretend we were flying angels. He practiced softball with us, taught us how to make the perfect sandwich (with nothing sticking off the edge of the bread of course), and watched wrestling with us on the regular. We even got so into it with him that he bought us talking wrestling figurines home one day after work - Macho Man Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan - our favorites. Not only that but we consistently and without fail would jump up and down on the bed yelling ""Clothes line me, Daddy!"" for a good hour before we gave up playing wrestling to watch it on tv. He once brought home a case of Budweiser stickers from a factory he had been working on so instead of wearing Mommy's shoes around the house, my sister and our neighbors covered our feet in stickers and pretended they were the most elegant shoes. Our dad loved to make breakfast - it was his favorite part of the day. You can't live in New Jersey without knowing how to make a proper pork roll egg and cheese. I remember Daddy always wanting breakfast at any time of day and it's the main reason I'd wanted to open a small diner sometime in my future. Daddy always told me he would love to stop everything and just own a breakfast place and cook eggs all day. Now we're not allowed to visit him without bringing pork roll :)He lives up in the middle of Pennsylvania now with his amazing sister Jill, her husband Bill, and two kids Laura and Amanda. They are doing their best to take care of him, and we could never thank them enough for that. After his divorce from mom, things got really difficult for him and he just wasn't the same person any more. He had lost a piece of himself and what he thought his life was no longer. His kids had gone away to school and he was alone, so Jill graciously offered to take him from his new hell and give him a new start. He had been through enough for any one person and deserved to get happier and healthier. Unfortunately, things don't always turn out as we hope.Dad, Don, I guess you should know what his name is - has stage 4 rectal cancer that has metastasized to the liver. The first time he went to the doctor for his pain, it was already too late to do much, but the doctors gave us hope - as is I guess they're supposed to. So they started him on chemo hoping to shrink down the tumor at the end of his intestine enough to operate to remove it. We thought the chemo was doing it's job. Daddy barely had any side effects except for a bit of finger tip and mouth numbness. He bought himself an economy pack of lysol wipes for any mishaps and had buckets everywhere just in case. It really seemed like he was facing this head on and was ready to beat it into submission. He told me once when I went up to visit him that ""Nothing is going to kill me. I'm not ready to go yet and I won't let it happen"".He continued to work as much as possible. He would have to take a few days off directly after treatments, but he still usually worked every day to help out around the house and probably to keep everyone from worrying too much. By the end of his first round of treatments he had dropped down to 180 pounds. He didn't look sickly, but he also didn't look like the bull we remembered as Daddy. The doctors told him the chemo only shrank the tumor by a centimeter and didn't have any effect on either of the two spots on his liver. They started him on a second round of chemo which he is currently going through now - he is about half way through and it's the strongest treatment available. After this, there are no more options. Currently, Daddy weighs a skeletal 145 pounds. He has no muscle left, he has no fat left, he cannot eat or he will just throw it up. He can barely move himself as far as it is from the couch to the kitchen without exhausting himself. He doesn't work much anymore, and he sleeps for about 16-20 hours a day. On our last visit to see him, out of the four days we spent there, we saw him for maybe 3 hours total. Despite all of his favorite foods we made him (including pork roll of course) he only ate a tiny sliver of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. This new treatment, plus the ever strengthening cancer is very rapidly taking our father from us.Daddy is cold all of the time now. He doesn't smile or joke, he doesn't leave the house unless it is to go to the doctor or if he feels well enough to make it to work, which is almost never at this point. We have never been a well to do family and haven't been on many - if any - vacations that weren't sponsored by softball or girl scouts. Daddy never liked the beach, but we really want nothing more than to be able to give him one nice warm vacation for him to think about on the days when he's feeling down. So despite this long story, our goal here is just to send Daddy some where where he can go outside and sit in the sun and enjoy the day without having to wear a knit hat, several pants, socks and jackets. We're thinking Florida as it would have to be soon that we would have to take him. We're not sure that he will be able to hold out until the Jersey Shore is warm enough. Every day we wish we were closer to him to see him and take care of him, or even just to listen to him when he needed someone to talk to. He has amazing family surrounding him, but he is our Dad. We need him in our lives and it terrifies us to think that We're completely helpless to do anything for him. So if you can find it in your heart to donate, we're not asking for medical bill help, we're simply asking to be able to afford to take Daddy to a place of no worries - even if it's only for a short time. No one is perfect, but everyone deserves a chance to smile. Please help us make this happen for him. Share with your family and friends. We want to give back to the father that gave us everything he had in him. Thank you guys, and I hope that you are fortunate enough to never have to endure this. No one should be forced to watch someone they love lose their life.

                                                            on behalf of Jonathan Lester

HURRICANE, WV                                





                        Hello,  My name is Connie Bays and I have a remarkable story to tell you. It is one that has brought me fear, challenges, hope and more than incredible joy. There is no bigger experience for a woman, as that of being a mother. I have been incredibly blessed to have been given three beautiful and healthy children. I have two older daughters and my son is my youngest. It is he whom I would like to tell you about.Let me introduce to you my son, Jonathan Richard Lester. Jonathan was born on November 13, 1994. He is an amazing human being. He is also autistic. Autism is most definitely a challenge and an unforgettable journey; but, I sure do love my tour guide! Jonathan is a student in his second year at Marshall University. He is pursuing a Bachelor in Science Degree with emphasis on video game design and development. Let me give you some background information on my son. When Jonathan entered into school, he was able to talk; however, he was not able to hold a conversation with you. When he didnt know how to word what he wanted to say, he would make up a word. Family, of course, would understand this form of communication, but others would not. He entered into education in a special education setting. He also received speech therapy. For the next 10 years of his educational experience, Jonathan remained in special education. Over those years, there was a vast improvement in his communication. During this time, unbeknownst to me, Jonathan was working towards a modified degree, not a regular high school diploma. I became aware of this; I believe it was in the beginning of his 11th grade year in school. I never knew if Jonathan would be able to attend college, but quite obviously, if he was able to, I wanted him to be able to do so. With the modified diploma he would receive as a special ed student, this would not be possible, as a modified diploma is not accepted at colleges. I made the decision to pull Jonathan out of special ed and place him in regular classes. At first, this decision was met with concern that he may not be able to do it; however, placing him back in special ed would always be an option if there were problems. Jonathan entered into classes in which he had never before had exposure, such as algebra, history, science, and geometry. He got his first grade card. He had straight As. This was repeated with the 2nd and the 3rd grade card and so on. He was set back 2 years in order to be able to get the credits that he needed for graduation. During his high school years, he participated in the band, playing the trombone during concerts and the bass drum during football games. In June of 2015, Jonathan graduated with honors from Hurricane High School. In August of 2015, he entered Marshall University. He completed his first year with As and Bs. During his first year, he participated in concert band. This year, he switched to the Marshall University Marching Thunder Band. He is still playing the trombone.  Jonathan is a truly wonderful person. He is well liked by all. He is hard working, helpful and caring. He is a very sweet and gentle soul. He has never given me any trouble whatsoever and has been a big help to me during times of health difficulties. Jonathan has an opportunity that is a chance of a lifetime. Quite frankly, I need some help in assuring that Jonathan can participate in this once in a lifetime event. So I am looking for sponsors to assist with this dream for Jonathan.The Marshall University Marching Band has been invited to go to Rome, Italy to participate in the New Years Eve parade with the Pope! During the experience overseas, Jonathan and the rest of the MU Marching Thunder will perform a concert in Naples. Some of the places he will be touring will include the following: The Circus Maximus, The Palatine, Capitoline Hills, Castel SantAngelo, Vatican City, The Vatican Museum, The Sistine Chapel, St. Peters Basilica, The Spanish Steps, The Trevi Fountain, The Pantheon, The Colosseum, The Roman Forum, the largest Amphitheatre built in the Roman Empire, The Arch of Titus, The Temple of Julius Caesar, The Basilica of Constantine, Naples and Pompeii. The trip will take place on December 30, 2016 through January 6, 2017. The cost to Jonathan is $2680.00 after MU pays $1000.00 towards the total cost of $3680.00. Because Jonathan is autistic, a family member needs to accompany him. The fee for the family member is $3680.00. So, the total amount that is needed to be raised for Jonathan is $6360.00. I cannot begin to cover this on my own and so I am looking for sponsors. I know that this is a lot to ask. Any donation at all would be so appreciated. For a kid of his background to have persevered and come as far as he has is truly remarkable. As his mother, Im sure you can understand that I want this college experience to be amazing for him. This trip would be amazing and unforgettable. He has worked so very hard to get this far and I truly believe that, with his determination, that the sky is the limit. I love this child with every ounce of my being and want him to be able to experience all that life has to offer him. Wont you please help me to make his dream come true? His fees have to be paid in full before the point in which it is 45 days prior to the departure date. That falls in the time frame of the first 2 weeks of November 2016. Anything that you can give; no matter how much, will all add up to his being able to take part in this trip. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am attaching a photo taken of Jonathan during band camp, so you can see the focus and determination he has to succeed. Again, thank you so much! Sincerely yours,                              Connie F. Bays

                            George Garza Jr.
                            
                            
                                                           
SAN ANTONIO, TX                                




Hello, friends and family!You know me as many things. I am a musician. I am a community organizer. I am a student. I am a cook. I am a son, a grandson, and a nephew. I am a padrino. I live to make you smile. I dance to celebrate life. I sing to heal myself and others. I believe that life is meant for living, and I'm here to live as much life as possible. This year, I am challenging myself to live, experience, and see more than ever before. My theme this year is ""travel"". I have been inspired by so many beautiful people in recent years as I've continued to express my desire to see the world. So many of the people I admire have visited places all over the world, and I am convinced that something very special happens when you experience first hand that the world is so much bigger than yourself and your own way of life. I long for that experience, and many of you have reaffirmed that it is a MUST. I'm ready to venture out. Over the last couple years, I've set an intention to travel after graduating from college. Within that plan has always been the awareness that I can in no way afford it financially. I became aware that in order to make this dream a reality, I'd have to humble myself and do something that made me slightly uncomfortable. I'd have to ask for help. As the time has come closer, I've come to peace with the fact that I'd one day soon be asking you for a huge favor - to support/sponsor my travels with a monetary gift. That time is now.I'm asking you to give whatever you can, hoping that I can somehow show you that your gift is not taken for granted. For those that haven't heard my plan, the ultimate goal this year is to travel to Europe on a personal and artistic excursion. I intend to spend the better part of three months traveling to various countries, connecting with people and building a network of support for myself and any friends that will eventually be heading in the same direction. I am on a mission to plant seeds for my musical endeavors, as well as achieving that profound personal transformation that can only be understood through real experience and not just in the words and stories of others. I plan to leave for Europe in August and return in late October. The money goal I set is to support this trip and others I will be taking this year, covering travel, lodging, food, and general living necessities, as well as some leisure time. I am setting this goal over the next two months, and I appreciate any extra help in spreading the word as I will be making personal phone calls and emails to as many people as possible. I have an amazing life, full of love and support, scored by an over-abundance of incredible memories, many of which I share with you all publicly in photos, video, and even audio recordings, as well as many powerful experiences in private. I've shared some of the most special moments in private with you, and you know my heart. I feel blessed, and with that I thank you in advance for putting wind in my sails. Your humble servant,George Mario Garza, Jr.

HAPPY VALLEY, OR                                




Hi, family and friends! And hello, future friends!I'm excited to announce that after 10 years of saying ""I'm going to Korea,"" I am FINALLY GOING TO KOREA! It took me a long time but its finally happening. Recently, there had been a great deal of pressure because my passport is about to expire and I've not used it even ONCE! So, I am thrilled to be checking this off of my bucket list.From time to time again, I had been advised to take advantage of this opportunity before graduating and so here I am! Grasping opportunity!For those who are not up to date about me, I am a student majoring in Arts & Letters (may also be known as Humanities Major) at Portland State University. This is my senior year, so as a way to wrap things up and celebrate this chapter of my life; I will be completing my final 6 credits (of undergrad) studying abroad at the University of Ulsan this summer.I will be the only student from Portland State participating in the Ulsan International Program, which is a 4-week Korean studies program that consists a broad range of classes and excursionsfromKorean language and culture, to history, society and business.And during the duration of this program,July 4th through the 29th, I hope to improve my communication skills, broaden my mind of worldly views, to seek adventure and to build confidence so that one day, I may do better for myself in order to do better for the world. How? I'm not so sure yet, but I'm hoping this experience would help me find my answers.Aside from all the fun and excitement, on a serious notedid you know that study abroad students are twice as more likely to find a job than a student without study abroad experience?Did you know students who have studied abroad receive about a 25% higher salary than those who did not?And did you know that about 94% of study abroad alumni claims to have matured more, have moreself-confidence, and have greater tolerance for ambiguity through their experience? These are only a few statistics that I took into consideration, along with encouragements from friends and motivations from families, to spread my wings and fly.But just like most things in life, this journeyof a lifetime does not come without a price. I can definitely useyour help. My airline tickets will be purchased with money I have set-asidespecifically for this occasion, but tuition and other costs are where I hope to receive some relief.Tuition & Fees (PSU 6-credits): $900Housing & Meals (provided by UOU): $400Education Abroad Fee (PSU charge): $400Health Insurance ($2 per day): $60TOTAL: $1,760If you are able to donate, whether big or small, I am sincerely grateful for your generosity. But regardless of your donation, I appreciateyour time checking this campaign and reading it from beginning to end.Thank you so much.Yee

ATHENS, GA                                




For many Winters, now, my spirit has heard the voices of the Ancestors, calling, come, see, listen, learn, write, share. The calling is compelling me to travel West, and the message is, the time isnow.I have danced upon the shores of Tamarino Bay, but never have I seen the Grand Canyon. I have sat on the steps of the Parthenon and felt the presence of the ancient philosophers, but I have never stood beneath the giant redwoods, or sat in the presence of the Elders. I have ridden horseback to the pyramids in Egypt, but never seen the Sacred Black Hills, knelt upon the ground where our native people lived, hunted, fought, and crossed over. I am eager to experience all of this and more, not only for my own personal growth, but for what this journey may enable me to return to our people. I am visioning myself as an envoy of sorts, venturing into Sacred Space, participating in the exchange of Medicine, Ceremony, story, song, love, healing, and energy, then returning to our people better prepared to create and hold that Sacred Space for each other, offering its power in and through Ceremony, story, and song.It is my intentionto travel as simply as possible, in the manner of our nomadic, plains ancestors, driving (an allowed convenience), and camping along the way(no hotels or motels allowed),taking time to be open to the people, the magic, and miracles along the way, photo journaling the story, and posting regularly in my blog. I will be bringing my music and my message along to share with those the Creator may bring into my vision along the way of this journey.  The Sacred Pipe will also accompany along the way, eager to share its Medicine and healing.My first extended stay over will be in Ava, MO. I have been blessed with an awesome opportunity to sit in Ceremony, and study with the Elders at the New Haven Native American Church. There I will camp on the 460 acre Ceremonial Grounds. While here, I will be ""adopted"" into the Native American Church. My studies and work there will result in full and legal accredidation as an ordained Minister in the Native American Church, thus fulfilling a life-long desire and calling on my life. From Ava, the route will take me into the Dakotas, South, and North, where I will spend time in areas of the land considered very sacred among the Native People.Then, ontoBozeman, MT, where I have the opportunity to speak, teach, and share the story and song of my music. Eventually, I will make my way to through Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and on to California to spend time with my relatives in the Medicine Path Native American Church in Berkley, CA. It is this Church that provides the covering and blessing for my Altar, and the Sacred Pipe with which I pray and carry for our people.It is not an easy, nor comfortable thing for me to do to ask for help and support. Yet, are we not told, ""We have not for we ask not?"" ""Ask, and you will receive.""  Furthermore, I am not seeking funding for the entire trip, as I am believing the Universe to open its abundance in and through the magic and miracles that await me along the way. A stop here and there to play music, an impromptu concert in the campground, and an openness to goodness and generosity of the people along the way will carry me from here to there. I am seeking assistance in funding the gear (minimum) (my trusted North Face was stolen a few Winters ago) necessary to begin, and a jump start in the intention. I have 364 Facebook friends. A generous investment of as little as $10.00 would meet and exceed the goal.Your return? Your reward? Beyond the obvious mutual exchange of energy, participation in and of the dream, you will be provided access to my blog site (blackeaglesoars.wordpress.com) , photo updates, a copy of the journal once it is done, and a CD of my music,( https://soundcloud.com/tags/ambience%20music) and the confidence that when it is your turn, you can know that your deposit, your investment will some day assure your withdrawal from the generosity, abundance, and favor of the Universe.It is my hope to begin the journey on 29 July 2015 - the day of my 64th Winter. Regardless, I have committed to myself, to Creator, and to the Spiritual Elder of the New Haven Native American Church, Ava, MO, that I will be there, ready for a Ceremonial Gathering on 15 August 2015.SPECIAL BONUS FEATURE!! Any gifting of $100 or more will receive a PRIVATE, one hour concert in your place of choice!! Invite your friends, and let us celebrate the music of Magic and Miracles, The Journey.A'o!

St. Anthony's 8th Grade Washington D.C. Trip ,"$9,318 ","$13,000 ",Travel," November 5, 2012",88,47,MILWAUKEE,WI,382000,1,,"






                            Matt Dixon
                            
                            
                                                           
MILWAUKEE, WI                                




Background: St. Anthony School is an urban elementary
school located in a Spanish speaking community of south side Milwaukee. The majority of the school population at St.
Anthony School are English-as-a-second-language Hispanic students who participate in the
Milwaukee Parental School Choice program.
Ninety-eight percent of the students are low income. 



Our students' realities do not readily
afford them opportunities to see different parts of the country. Not only will this trip enhance their
academic knowledge, it will open up to them a new world of possibility. At St. Anthony School, we preach that hard
work in school will lead to lifelong success; this trip to our nation's capital
will show the students where hard work and perseverance can take them. Alongside lessons on history, politics, and
government, students will understand that there is a world outside of Milwaukee
where they can live and succeed if they continue on their educational path.





The Trip: The purpose of this trip is to enrich our students' learning
outside the classroom and expand their awareness of areas outside Milwaukee
city limits. This field trip will
provide an active learning experience for the students that will help them gain
a greater appreciation for their country and history and provide a complete and
accurate picture of their national government.
Additionally, the field trip may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience that
will inspire and motivate each of them to persevere and succeed in school.



Based on projected expenses, the cost to bring twenty of our 8th grade students to Washington D.C. from May 12th to May 17th is approximately $13,000. As this is the first year we are trying to take students on this trip, we are trying tofund raise as much as we can so as to ensure that we cover our expenses and that we can make the trip happen.Students will be doing fundraising on their own throughout the school year, yet we are setting our goal at $13,000 so as to better ensure that we obtain the financial means to take our students on this once-in-a-lifetime trip.



Based on our current cost projections, the $13,000 is accounted for by the following expenses:



Transportation: $7,000

Hotel/Lodging: $3,000

Food: $3,000



Any and all donations are greatly appreciated as they will directly be applied to our goal of taking a group of our 8th grade students on what is surely to be a memorable and eye-opening experience.



If you have any questions or would feel more secure making a written donation, please contact Matt Dixon at: dixonm@archmil.org

I like to call it ""Cuba before colonization.""The trip will explore the complexities of the Cuba-U.S. relationship at an extraordinary and historic crossroads. Along the way, we'llwrestle with difficult questions about inequality, resource use, culture, and government, as well asthe multiplicity of perspectives on US capitalism and the progression of Cuban development (super interesting stuff!)This trip brings together so many of my passions including: language, culture, and international relations.After a successful four years at Sidwell, this trip will bring a close to myhigh school experience.Thanking you in advance for your support, your prayers, your advocacy!If you'd like to learn more about the program please visit  http://schoolforethics.org/segl-in-cuba/

VENICE, CA                                





                        Hello friends and family, near and far! I NEED YOUR HELP. (I know it feels like a lot to read..but don't give up yet!!) A good friend of mine has recently been diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)...and recently as in just earlier this week. The news is naturally pretty difficult to take in.  You might not know what ALS is, but are probably familiar with the ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" that went viral across the Internet. That challenge was created to raise money for researching ALS, seeking to find a cure for a currently incurable disease.  Those diagnosed with this neurodegenerative  disease suffer from rapid deterioration of the body's voluntary muscles (muscles we control like the face, arms, and legs) when the disease attacks the nerve cells (neurons) that control these muscles. This includes the muscles in the diaphragm and chest wall that control breathing. Around 90% of those suffering from ALS will die within 3-5 years of diagnoses as a result of respiratory failure. HERE IS WHERE YOU COME IN!!!  My friend has big dreams. Dreams to see the world. With a new restriction over the potential timeline of his life, he wants to see as much as he can before he is no longer able to walk (possibly as early as this year). HELP HIM EXPLORE THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD! It feels so unfair to me, as an avid traveler, that there are so many people who do not get the opportunity to experience what I have. So how can I help? Well, if you know me...you know I'm just as broke as the next broke backpacker...so I can't exactly make his dreams come true on my own. SO I REALLY NEED ALL OF YOU AMAZING PEOPLE TO HELP ME HELP SCOTT!  Contributions as little as $1.00 show your support to someone who may be going through a little more than you. It is important to me that Scott gets his chance to see this incredible world just like the rest of us. If you could give a little bit of your time and money to help someone follow their dreams, why wouldn't you? Perhaps it's one less coffee, one less movie ticket, one less drink at the bar...but think about how much further that money could go for someone else. (Hint: it will be life changing!) There's no greater feeling in this world than an act of compassion and love, even to a stranger. PLEASE HELP! And don't hesitate to contact me or him directly for anything!  This cause means the world to me as it is affecting someone near and dear to my heart who shares the same goals and passions that I do. I appreciate all of you who donate, share, or even took the time to read this. LOVE YOU ALL!

Send Alfredo to DNC - Philadelphia ,$920 ,"$2,000 ",Travel," June 11, 2016",24,3,LAREDO,TX,379000,,4,"

LAREDO, TX                                





                        My name is Alfredo Jimenez, and I am a proud Democrat.I was born and raised in Laredo, Texas and to this day, I reside in District 21.Just to tell you a little about my family, my parents were immigrant workers who traveled at a young age around several states to harvest crops with their parents. My maternal grandfather had been taken out of school at age four to work the fields. As a result, he died not knowing how to spell his own name. Nevertheless, he instilled in me the importance of participating in the decision making process and the importance ofparticipating in political movements. Why am I a proud democrat?As a social worker, I have worked for the past five years with families living within District 21.Ihavehad the privilege of working asasafety specialist and investigator with the Department of Family Protective Services fortwo years. I then workedwith the Health and Human Services Commission as eligibility specialist processing applications for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid for children and pregnant women, Medicare Savings Programs and Medicaid for the elderly and disabled.I now workfor the Office oftheAttorney General,helping single parents obtain child support.Over the pastfive years,I have witnessed the benefits of programs that target those in need andIhave seenhow a Democratic President and Congresshaveimproved the life of millions. We cannot allow the divisiveness of the Republican Party to control the Federal Government atsucha pivotal moment in time.Iamaskingyou to send a message to the Republican Party by supporting me to represent the very diverse District 21 at the DNC. During this election,the issue of immigration has beenput in the forefront because of thederogatory remarks made by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. I decided to run for a spot at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to highlightthe strong contrast between both parties.Hillary Clintonstrack recordof supporting LGBT and immigration policies is impressive and coincide with my strong values surrounding these issues.Imagine seeing a first generation college graduate, son of migrant workers and LGBT person from Texas represented on a national level.As a young voter,thiswill be the second time I am involved with the Hillary Clinton presidential run. I have always supported her values and stand fully committed to ensuring that she becomes our next president.Your support for me as a representative of District 21 is a statement for Donald Trump! It will serve as a strong message to the Republican Party, telling them that we will no longer stand for their divisive rhetoric.

                        Last year from March 16th 2014 to November 6th 2014 I walked across America from Cape Henlopen Delaware to Venice Beach California. Thanks to you, the journey was acomplished. Now, im at it again. I'll be walking from Bullville New York to Bonsall California. My goal is to make it across America on foot. Your support would go toward gear, food, and a place to stay from time to time.I'm ready to sacrifice myself to bring you images we should all see in life from my personal perspective. My hopes are to be funded enough to make it all the way across again while bringing you the story and updates through fb posts. I have been on the road now for 2 weeks and have captured some images I think you may like. I'll continue to walk for you, me and everyone who cannot do this for themselves but always had the passion to. Help bring this journey to life. You are loved! Thank You!

                        Dancing Caddis is making a film about women anglers of the Greater Yellowstone area. We are currently writing a proposal for Trout Unlimited's ""Put Her In The Picture"" film grant. If we are awarded the grant, our film will be entered into the 2017 F3T-Fly Fishing Film Tour. Fly fishing has long been known as a man's sport but women everywhere are falling in love with it. We are women with a passion for fly fishing and wild places around Yellowstone. We are a tight knit, supportive, and vastly growing community. We will share our love of the river, trout, and the public lands around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Your monetary contributions will help us to acquire Public Land Film Permits, pay public land rental fees, and meet production costs. Encouraging women to pick up a fly rod, get outside, and fish is our greatest joy. Your support will enable us to make this happen. With the possibily of not receiving the grant from TU we will still continue production and you all will be able to view our film upon completion no matter what!Thank you!Sincerely,Dancing Caddis and friends http://www.dancingcaddis.com/  https://www.facebook.com/dancingcaddis/  https://www.instagram.com/dancing.caddis/

My children have lived their entire lives in Brooklyn, NY, (11/14yrs), until THIS weekend when they were relocated, ""Temporarily"" to live with my Ex Husband, his current wife and 2 teenage children who have been attempting to do so since 2009!! Family Court. #Tear(s)How Do You Come Back from one of THE MOST devastating blows of your LIFE?Take a moment, catch your breathe and if you can...figure out how to begin NU!Not emotionally all there yet but I did come up with THIS TODAY!!I need to RAISE MONEY to now TRAVEL back and forth for my FAM to not allow my children to believe 'It's Over'--Mommy's alittle down but certainly not OUT! They will be Crazy Excited for me to show up there for them! However, mommy still have to Heal/Grow herself--in NYC--HOME so they have something to come back to!!!! That's ALOT for a single mommy already WORKING to do w/out her day to day INSPIRATION...them, HERE. However, I KNOW it's what needs to be done. so...ANY AMOUNT, my people!

I was also told by a friend, Sabrina that you can transfer frequent flyer miles and since I don't travel that often I didn't know that! The place I will be traveling back and forth to and from is Cedar Falls, IA if this might be an easier way to help? IOWA??? Yes, I know--nothing against the state but my kids grew up HERE and was FINE with it.Because we are not from IOWA, we have no friends to stay with, pick/drive us around etc so the money will be used for: plane tickets, hotel stays, food, rental cars and caring for my sons. My sister has had sooooo much to do with why I still have the energy to fight and would be coming with me during these visits which is why I asked for the amount I am attempting to raise.

The Krankin' Thru China program has been able to grow and develope over the last 3 years, bringing the sport of handcycling to those in China with physical disabilities. We have been able tobring awareness to hundreds of people to all over the country and get so many active again. Throughout the year, we put on monthly event rides and even help others to purchase their very own handcycles. All in an effort to get more and more people healthy and happy.The money raised will help pay for the trip's logistics and travel for our riders on the trek as we handcrankacross the beautiful, Chinese countryside. And just for the record, no fancy hotels or fine dining restaurants for this group! We embrace the true trekking style, and immerse ourselves in the surroundings, sleeping under the stars each night after a hard day of krankin'.This year's trek will be from March 31st to April 14th, 2016 and we are so excited to be able to continue our journey.

The academy is 960 miles from home. He is allowed to come home only a couple times per year and we are allowed to go visit him a couple times per year. This trips are quite expensive but very necessary for our family. We were asked to start this account so people could have the opportunity to help our family out with this expense. This is very hard to ask for assistance with this. If you can't make a donation, please just say a prayer for Mickeal first and then our family.

My name is Abe Ramirez, I am 22 years old and I have been traveling south to Argentina on bicycle for the last year.I am raising money to support a short film about my adventure not only on bicycle but highlighting people and places along the journey.There are a few risks and challenges to creating a short film of this magnitude. I need the proper equipment. My camera can shot film but it lacks in areas that I need. With the funds collected I will be able to film with a proper camera and audio equipment.I am settinga deadline for one month.This film means everything to me as it will to the people I share it with when It is finished. The purpose of this film is the same as the reason I am riding a bicycle across an entire continent. I want this film to inspire people to be all they can be. I want to show people there is world outside of their own, waiting to be explored. People who need them to pass by, say hello, and share a smile with. Places that will changethe core of a person's being by just living in that moment. This is a film about everything.Read about my previous Go Fund Me from last year.Stay connected: Instagram , Facebook , Website

                        Hello! My name is Lena Strickling, I recently finished my battle with cancer at the ripe old age of 18. I am making this page in hope that somebody out there may want to make my dreams come true. I've always loved to travel, meet new people, and learn about different cultures. I found a deep sense of regret at not having done anything exciting with my time on this earth. Because of this regret I decided that if I were to survive the tribulations that are cancer I would strike out and discover the world for myself, and what a world it is. This trip will mean so much more to me then just an adventure, it is a quest; a chance to really find out who I am. I feel I would have figured this out in highschool had I been able to attend. especially during my upperclassman years. During treatment I became recluse, hiding myself away. I spent so much of my time on my own, I forgot what it was like to socialize. It began to become unbearable and so I enrolled in a highschool close to the end of my treatment. It wasn't much but having something to do before radiation helped me want to keep going each day. Radiation was a difficult endeavor and being out and about before being strapped into the machine made it bearable. I would like to become a teacher but I don't think I'm ready to teach, I must first be aware of the country I live in and the many different people I share it with. I truely appreciate any help I can get. Every dollar will make a difference. I am hoping to raise enough to get me a plane ticket to Seattle, Washington so that I may start my adventure off with seeing my mom and two younger siblings. They were by my side through all of my struggles, and I would like nothing more then for them to be there for the start of my new and exciting life. I am hoping we will able to raise enough for the ticket to seattle, food and supplies and maybe a bit of back up money in case of an emergency. Any help would be appreciated including advice my email is keepyourheadup12397@gmail.com Thank you so very much for your help and please know you are truly appreciated.

                        On January 27, 2014, I had my left leg amputated below the knee. This was due to complications from a fractured Talus. I had spent the year before having three surgeries done to salvage this ankle that all failed.  I met a group of amazing people from all walks of life that shared similar stories. Amazing people with hearts open and hands ready to help. They told me I would be able to do anything and I believed them. These are the people of the San Antonio Amputee Foundation. Through their support group, I transitioned through my surgery and prosthetic fittings with great peace. Recently, I have been asked to climb Mt Killamanjaro in Tanzania, Africa. This will be a climb completed by 10-12 other amputees of verying situation and severity. We will all be training over the next year to prepare for our climb in Decemeber 2015. I am asking for help to pay for this once in a lifetime opportunity, as well as continued support of the San Antonio Amputee Foundation. This organization provides financial, emotional, physical and relationship support and activities to amputees and their families.  We are here as one to make sure everyone who wants to live an active life can regardless of their personal situation.CLOUD WALKERS - For those willing to overcome, we will show the world we can walk among the clouds.                                       ~Kevin Robinson

                        In September of 2015 my mom was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer, which is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer andcurrently has no cure. Since then thecancerhas spread rapidly, attackingher liver, bones, and most recently her brain. Her health has been declining at a very steady pace. We were told not long ago that at the rate at which her cancer is spreading, she may not even last through to the end of this year. My mom has given so much to me, throughout my life. She constantly struggled to support myself and my brother all on her own. She worked full time, and then some, doing whatever she had to do to ensure that both of her sons were provided for.It wasn't the easiest for us by any means and we frequently had to do without some of the things that many of our friends took for granted. One of those things was a real family vacation. Being a single mother with two growing boys meant that such luxuries were not in the cards for us.Knowing that the time that my my mom and I have together will be ending much sooner than we ever expected makes me want to enjoy every moment with her that much more. I would love nothing more than to give my mom the vacation of dreams and pamper her like a star. I would love to have memories with her in a place that is every bit as beautiful as she is. I want the last moments of my mom's wonderful life to be filled with all of the love and beauty that she has shown to me and everyone that she has ever come into contact with.I wish more than anything that I could just open up my wallet and make this dream into a reality, but that just isn't something that I am able to do. This is why I created this gofundme. I know that there are people out there that have been as touched by my mom as I have. I just hope that enough people are willing to show their support and help me give my mom a vacation of dreams. A vacation that is funded on the overwhelming amount of love that everyone has for her.I thank you for your help in showing my mom just how loved she is.

SANTA CRUZ, CA                                




PLEASE DONATE OR SHARE LINK.Hello, my name is Curtis Reliford I am the founder of Follow Your Heart Action Network. I am a grassroots guy who wants to make a difference helping others. I deliver donated items to one family at a time. I am a non-profit organizition that takes donated items and delivers them to the poorest of the poor.My goal is to go to these designated areas, have sacred circles to discuss community concerns, provide goods and services, and assist with reconstruction efforts. We will then carry this message everywhere we have an opportunity to speak. There will be a day when communities and towns around the country will have a Follow Your Heart Action Network of their own. It will truly be a grassroots effort to help neighbors in need.Inmy travels across this country,I have seen some of the poorest-of-the-poor in the United States.I want to make a difference by inspiringa percentage of the American people who care and want to share food, clothes and building material, and who will help out with funds to support this direct service of delivering these goods directly to the people who need them. We believe it's time for us to focus on the people here in our own country. If we can encourage the American people to get involved, we believe it would make a difference in the world.Join me on ajourneyof kindness. On my journey since 2005 I have made 19 trips to New OrleansKatrina Survivors. Recently I have started expanding by going toIndian Reservations.I have made 7 trips to the Hopi and Navajo reservation since 2012. I not only travel across country but also make local trips and contribute to locals in need. I could not have accomplished this alone. The generousity of the local community with donations has continued to enable me to help others.A new recent accomplishment of my organization has been the enrollment of young students to help and get involved. They have been encouraged and shown the difference they can make just be getting involved.Now if I can just reach more people and inspire them to make a difference.I am currently in need of a new 26' box truck and gas/travelfunds to complete future trips. My current equipment is constantly breaking down. In order to deliver these donated goods I need some new or reliable equipment to do so.Mylong-term vision is that Follow Your Heart Action Networks from all over the USA will come together in a designated place once a year to share stories, learn from each other, celebrate their accomplishments and return to their homes motivated to continue and even expand the service to their communities.It CAN be done. It WILL be done!  Thank you for reading my story, with the hopes that you will be inspired to donateso we can continue to serve directly to our country.

Latvian Soldiers Trip To U.S.,"$3,690 ","$5,000 ",Travel," August 29, 2014",34,25,WEIDMAN,MI,333000,,6,"

WEIDMAN, MI                                




I am trying to raise money to bring a couple of Latvian Soldiers that I served with to the U.S. We served together in the Kunar and Nuristan Province's of Afghanistan in 2009 / 2010. I would love to be able to bring our entire team over, but there would be nearly three dozen troops. I recently made the trip back to Latvia for a reunion with my team, and two of the men I served with went above and beyond to make my stay absolutely awesome. I need to be able to get them to the states so my family and friends can meet them, and so that they can see the great state of Michigan. One of the Soldiers in the photo is Latvian Sniper Sergeant Martins Dabolins. He was with me when I was shot and was the one to help get me to the MEDEVAC helicopter in Barge e Matal. He is also one of the men who fought at the Battle of COP Keating. You could read the story in the book ""The Outpost"". The second Soldier is of Captain Peteris Pleckens. We all served together at Barge e Matal and he was wounded two days before me with another Latvian Captain Dans Jansons. I am setting my goal high, in hopes to be able to get a couple more of the Latvians here to reunite with some of their Michigan team mates. Plane tickets are approximately $1500 per person. Aside from the plane tickets, I need help covering the other expenses for their stay. I understand if you can't afford to help, but if you can donate any money I would greatly appreciate it. These men may not wear an American uniform, but make no mistake they have laid it all on the line for our country and for American troops.

Documenting My 1st Trip to China,"$2,225 ","$3,500 ",Travel," September 3, 2016",24,22,ENGLISHTOWN,NJ,327000,,1,"

ENGLISHTOWN, NJ                                





                        Hi, I'm Shirley, first generation American Born Chinese (ABC). I will be going on my first trip to China, my first trip to Asia actually. Sounds surprising, right? Me too. A trip to China was no where in mynear future. By the way, that lead photo is of my grandparents with my aunts and uncles as children, with some other relatives standing behind them. My father is the last one to the right, he was about 15 years old in that photo.Surprisingly,I've been offered a trip to travel to China with a group for three weeks and to document my experience, but some parts of the trip are not covered. As a journalist (though I am not traveling there as a journalist), I naturally want to document my first trip. I'm not a film maker, but I am inspired by my film maker friends to tell stories and going to China is a big story for me. You see, part of the trip will include visiting Toisan, my ancestral home.My mother's childhood home is still standing and that the seed she planted as a child outside the home is now a big tree according to photos my mother sawwhen my unclevisited afew years ago. Hopefully the tree is still there. In order to document this trip, I'm here to ask for your support. Many of you know that I am still in search of a f/t job, so every bit of your contribution of any amount is appreciated.You will be part of my journey with your contribution which will help cover luggage fees, transportation to and from the airport, travelinsurance and local transportation in HK/Toisan/Shanghai. It will also help cover costs for items like SD cards. I do not plan on taking my laptop to empty out the SD cards into an external drive since all western social media networks are blocked in China, except for Hong Kong, so a laptop will be of no use and it would be one less thing for me to worry about as it may get damaged or worse, stolen. To also help document the trip, I need a few other accessories and toreplace my brokennon-stereomicrophone which is held together by two black hair rubberbands, the kind girls use for a ponytail. Yeah..it's true.(Broken microphone)This is a photo of Mom and Dadon their last day ever in China, taken at the Hong Kong International airport as a newly weds. They were leaving China to begin their lives in America. When in Toisan, I hope to learn more about my parents' early lives there and to also gain new appreciation of their brave move to America. They never went back to China after arriving into the US, so this trip will also be my way ofpaying homage to them and my ancestors.I have lots of homework ahead of me, talking to my relatives to get the exact location of the villages, to have the village names written in Chinese, get my grandparents names and to find out if there are any relatives still living there. I also plan on speaking to the Ng Family Association in Manhattan's Chinatown.I'm quite nervous to be so far away from home to tell you the truth, and for you frequent travelers to China, pleasefeel free to reach out to me with any bit of insight you feel I need to know.Thank you in advance for your contribution. Please reach out to me if you have any questions about my trip.Shirley L. Ng

                        My name is Levi Harrington.  I am 22 years old.  I live in Pleasanthill, Iowa with my dad, Nathan.  I have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Osteoporosis, Cardio Myopathy, Obstructive Lung Disease, Spinal Fractures and a broken hip that cannot heal, due to the severity of my osteoporosis.  I also suffer from chronic pain, depression, OCD and anxiety.  My father is my primary caregiver, 24 hours a day.I love art, reading history and philosophy, music concerts, comedy, singing, fishing, science, and I would love to attend college.  I love participating in political activities and want to improve my skills making renaissance period jewelry and pendants.  I need to have opportunities to make friends.Recently, our handicap-accessible van broke and needs a new engine.  This is the only reasonable mode of transportation that is available to me.  My father and I need our van fixed as soon as possible, so we can get to my frequent doctor visits that include neuromuscular, cardiology, pulmonary, and psychological counseling specialists.  We also need our van fixed so I can continue to participate in political activism, attend musical and comedy concerts this summer and to transport me to and from future college classes.  I would love to begin volunteering at a children's hospital.  In addition, I would love to travel out of state to visit family members and to see the mountains again before I die.  The cost of a new engine and related repairs will be $2500.  That is an impossible amount for us to accumulate within a reasonable time.  Without the van I am limited to staying at my apartment all the time, playing video games and watching movies, and reading.  An additional $500 would be nice to help us pay for a vacation.I was recently hospitalized for nearly two weeks in Des Moines and Iowa City.  During that time my dad did not get paid to care for me and also had to pay for hotel rooms and meals while he was in Iowa City with me.  We are financially strapped and unfortunately it will take months to save the money we need.  I have no idea how many more years I will be alive, so I would like to get our van fixed ASAP.  I want to be able to enjoy the time I have left and, if possible, be able to cross some things off my bucket list.Please help my dad and I fix our van.Thank you so much.

                        Hi. I'm Rosette Royale, a writer and storyteller living in Seattle. There's a story Iwant to tell: A man named Sven Haakanson, Jr. will be traveling to Kodiak Island to help indigenous people there build a replica of an ancient Alaska-Native kayak. The kayak is called an Angyaaq, and in the late 1800s, Russian settlers on Kodiak destroyed every Angyaaq. The trip to craft areplicais August 5 - 11.In order to tell this story of indigenous people helping each other regain their lost culture, I need some help. It's gonna cost $3,000 to pay forairfare, travel while on Kodiak, raingear, a sturdy tent, boots and a good camera. Donations will help offset these costs,as I've already had to dig into my account to pay for travel and a warm, synthetic sleeping bag. It will alsoallow me to cover personal expenses while Ipitch the story to magazines and radio programs when I return.I think stories like this  where people help each other, where we learn of indigenous peoplereclaiming their identities in the face of dominant cultures  are important. They enableus to understand our connection to each other, enable us toappreciate and value our neighbors. They tether us to an immense and divine world.Your assistance would... Well, I don't know if I can express how deeply I would value your help. You would allowme to fulfill a deep calling. For that, I would be eternally grateful. In return, I'd do my best to share this story with you and others.So thank you...Rosette

theglobetrol.com Hi! Our names are Christian and Jennifer and we are planning to travel the Americas. Christian is a recent veteran who is originally from Ohio. I, Jennifer am from Chicago, Illinois with very little traveling under my belt. I headed out to Alaska for my first adventure a few years ago where the stars aligned and Christian was last stationed. We start off our journey in Sitka, Alaska and spend three weeks to makeour way to southern California where we lived for over a year. When we left Sitka we decided that we would eventually travel south and hopefully make it to Patagonia. While in California we started planning for the ""big trip"" to overland as far south as we could and then head back to the United States after a year. We picked out a van this summer that we could transform into a camper, buying one already outfitted was out of our means. For the last six months we have been building our own tiny-house out of an Astro van that will take us down to South America. The journey just building and transforming the vehicle has been exciting and stressful, not including getting ready for a year long trip to travel 20,000 miles just one-way. This has been a dream of ours for years and we are so close to getting it on the road. ""We are actually doing it!"" No matter what, we will leave by the first of the year in 2016 or before and head south. We saved enough money to build a vanhaus (van-house) and to travel south in it. Right now we are not sure how far south we can goand make it back;how many side trips and adventures we can afford to do, if any. At the very least we need help with gas and food cost beyond Central America. To get to South America from Panama we will have to ship our vanhaus on a container then fly to pick it up, in addition to repeating that again to get home. It's not cheap. If we can raise enough funds to do this, the ultimate dream and goal is to make it to Patagonia in our vanhaus and all the way home in about a year or so. If we can make it to South America we would love to visit Angel Falls in Venezuela, The Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, hike the Inca Trail toMachu Picchu in Peru, Christ the redeemer in Brazil, Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, Iguazu Falls, learn the tango, try their wine in Argentina, and make it to the ice caves in Patagonia. If we are able to raise enough money by May 2016 then we could take this once in a lifetime trip even further beyond our dreams through South America and back. For as long as we both together and individually can remember traveling has been a dream. We have finally made it to a point in our lives to take this awesome trip. We quit our jobs, gave up our lease, sold almost everything we own in order to live and travel out of a van. We plan to share it with as many people as possible via social media and a website that will allow others to come along with us. We don't look at this trip as a vacation, instead it's a chance to grow and become more diverse as individuals. We are excited to learn another language, experience many other cultures, become more knowledgable about other countries, and overcome the many challenges that this trip will bring upon us . The education we will gain is infinite. We are already grateful for the amount of support and love that we have received from our friends and family. Anything more is a godsend, and goes beyond thankful without saying. If you are able to aid in any way and extend our trip, we are much obliged to continue our adventure. If you have an adventure that you can't take yourself and would like to send us...let us know, WE WILL GO!theglobetrol.com you can find more photos of the transformation onfacebook.com/theglobetrol1

Jalyn's Journey to Hokkaido,"$4,825 ","$5,000 ",Travel," February 23, 2016",24,7,ATLANTA,GA,301000,,4,"






                            Jalyn Gabriella Radziminski-Smith
                            
                            
                                                           
ATLANTA, GA                                





                        My name is Jalyn Radziminski. Im a second year student at Emory University studying Linguistics and Human Rights. As a multi-racial woman and 2nd generation Japanese- American, my dream is to live a lifestyle that contributes to the development and building of relations between different international, diverse communities and people. I am also passionate about social justice and the acceptance of oppressed identities. I was inspired to study language by my grandfather Anthony Radziminski, who served as a linguist in the U.S. Air Force, and my grandmother, Michiko Radziminski, who came to America all the way from Wakanai Hokkaido. When I was younger I could only imagine what my grandmothers hometown (prefecture) was like. This summer I have been given an opportunity of a lifetime. I was recently accepted to the Hokkaido International Foundation (HIF) Summer Japanese Language and Culture Program. It is an honor to be a part of this program in order to facilitate the growth of my Japanese language skills and to connect to the culture of my heritage.Participating in the HIF Program will also help me improve my language skills to successfully volunteer as a Virtual Student Foreign Service Officer for the Japan-U.S. POW Friendship Program. This is a friendship and reconciliation program where the Japanese Government invites American POWs to Japan in interest in healing the wounds of war.  My university has given me a scholarship. However, the program costs are more than expected and I need to raise $5,000 to make my dream come true. Your donation of $20 (or whatever you are willing to give) could really help me reach my goal. I need to raise the money by May 1. For more information about the program, please go here:  http://www.hif.or.jp/en/summer/index.html. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I am so grateful for this opportunity. Thank you everyone for your support. I really could not have gotten as far as I am now without my supportive community. God Bless!

                        Friends of the Alaskan Malamute Working Dogare pleased to present two separate lectures by world famous dog sledding Arctic explorer Joe Henderson, During the Alaskan Malamute Club of America's National Dog Show week, Saturday October 22rd and Monday October 24th at theHotel Elegant, Colorado Springs. All donations and proceeds will go to host this spectacular event. Brief Bio: Joe Henderson and his team of Alaskan Malamutes have spent over 30 years traveling some of the worlds most inaccessible pristine lands of the far north, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The purpose of the expeditions is to explore the vast expanses of Alaskas North Slope country, view the unique wildlife, and experience raw adventure. Additionally, Joe records snow depth and ground condition data along with photographical documentation of an otherwise undocumented landscape in wintertime to benefit scientific research and provide a reference for future generations. Joe has spent over 32 winters in Alaskas backcountry with his Malamutes and has yet to see it all. To quote Joe, Ive mushed tens of thousands of miles in Alaskas arctic and have only seen a portion of it. It would take two-hundred years to cover it all. I just wish I had two, maybe three lifetimes to explore it.Please donate and help us sponsor this unique event. Anyone who donates $15.00 or more will receive free admission.Find out more:  http://www.alaskanarcticexpeditions.com/index.html

Six Feet Above Ground - A sweet dog and kind man on a walking pilgrimage of simplicity, peace, love and gratitude for all.

Hello, my name is Tim Middleton and this cute puppy is my partner Ki (pronounced 'kee'). This video tells the begining of our adventurous life together and her song says ""All is for one and one is for all...""I am humbly asking for contributions to raise $1100 for our walking pilgrimage, which I have named ""Six Feet Above Ground"". Walking with her 4 and my 2 feet, and still very much alive..!Your contributions will be usedto pay forward some expenses and support our very minimal needs while walking.My intention is this: To commit to walking at least 1100 miles between the vernal equinox, March 20 and the autumnal equinox, Sept 22, 2016. First section is begining from Lone Pine, California this Sunday 20th, and heading north along the eastern Sierra foothills and Hwy 395 towns of Independence, Big Pine and Bishop, engaging with humanity and nature, on trails, dirt and paved roads. More than 1 week walking, compared to the 1 hour car drive from Lone Pine. I intend eventually to arrive at Port Townsend, Washington, though with many unknown details yet to be revealed while along the journey.WHY am I doing this and WHY might you want to support us..? My intention is to walk a pilgrimage of peace and love, for everyone who can not. Firstly, my mother Heather, at 87 years of age, and my son Colin, soon to be 29, who is stationed for one year in the Persian Gulf with the USAF. And for every living being on this planet, and for the love of Gaia/planet Earth herself, this beautiful home in space we all share. I have long been a traveler and adventurer, with a deep love and respect of the wild, natural world and the kind people all around the globe. I am equipped, experienced and ready to walk 10 to 15 mile days, gifted with companionship as well by my amazing travel partner, Ki. (Watch this short video of our 50 mile walk last summer)  https://youtu.be/2RGWiSfyUQ0This next adventure is about giving and sharing from my heart, what I have accumulated in my varied occupations of my 54 years alive and will include a balance of humanity with nature. Pausing at various synergistic locations for the exchange of energy, in the way of labor towards gardening or other skills I have to offer, which you can see at:  www.FirmlyFlexible.com My intention with this is to reduce the need for cash to purchase things, by the direct exchange with another to give and receive with mutual benifit to all.I will also be sharing my poetry and music which can be found here:  https://www.reverbnation.com/timmiddletonWith this poem/song, ""A New Currency"" in particular as a theme, heard here:  https://www.reverbnation.com/timmiddleton/song/14351226-a-new-currencyI have intentionally declined a ""regular job"" in a fixed location this summer in order to create the openness required for such a journey as this. I am not receiving unemployment money or have much saved money for funding, intentionally so, to keep me humble, minimal and willing to help others.I am deeply grateful to all of you and your time to read this and visit these links to hopefully understand a little more about me and my passion for peaceful, simple living and artful expressions from my heart to yours. There will be much artful creativity arriving and I will be happy to share it with you...Please also view our blog:  http://theadventuresofki.blogspot.com/ to see past adventures and to follow along with our next grand adventure in life..!Please contact me with any questions or comments if you desire. I will be providing updates as the journey unfolds from the mystery...Much love and gratitude to you from Ki and T..!Thank you, Namaste,Tim

                        My son Sherrod Greene was chosen to attend the Nike Opening Finals in Beaverton Oregon to compete against the best football players in the nation. His trip is totally paid for but any parents who want to attend must purchase their own plane ticket, hotel stay and transportation to the events. As Sherrod's mom I do not want him to travel his first time alone. I am asking your help and support to make this great opportunity a successful one. Many of you believe and support all that Sherrod is accomplishing and we thank you for any amount you can give. The goal amount will cover my roundtrip airfare, room and board and transportation fees. Again, thank you so much for your liberal giving and support.

Last Summer, as I listened to Bernie Sanders speak, I realized that voting and emailing my legislators in Washington was not enough. In the words of Eldridge Cleaver, 'If you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem!'.  So, I did what Bernie suggested: I got involved with the Democratic Party. I began attending the Democratic meetings in my county. In November, I filed to run for Justice of the Peace in my county (that will be decided in this Fall's election). At that time I pledged Bernie Sanders for the Arkansas State Democratic Convention. During the State Democratic Convention I was selected to be the female delegate for Bernie Sanders representing Arkansas' 4th Congressional District.  So here I am, headed to Philadelphia. I believe in the positions of Bernie Sanders with all my heart and soul. This trip will cost a whole lot of money, more than this old woman will earn at her job in the next three months.  If you believe in Bernie Sanders as I do, please help me make this trip. I will represent you with enthusiasm and integrity. Help me Stand With Bernie!                POWER TO THE PEOPLE...

SAINT PAUL, MN                                





                                                Hi!My name is Danny Radermacher. I am a junior at UW-Madison where Im studying Civil Engineering. However, I am currently studying abroad in Brisbane, Australia. In an attempt to give my long-time best friend Justin Flesher the ultimate 21st birthday present, Ive decided to try and raise the money to pay for his airfare to Australia. If you know me and Flesher, it probably isnt hard to imagine that this truly would be the trip of a lifetime for both of us.A little background on my friendship with Justin. He has been my best friend since we met playing baseball when we were just 10 years old. Throughout this time, he has consistently given me incredibly thoughtful, creative and often customized birthday presents (a canvas painting of my best friends, a customized wood valet tray, and several concert tickets to see some of my favorite artists just to name a few). Ive always gotten him the generic gift card or video game when we were younger (lame), however, after 12 years of friendship, I have finally come up with the ultimate birthday present. This year, Im hoping to fly Justin to Brisbane, Australia so that we can spend his 21st birthday together. But I cant do it alone, I need your guys help. My goal is $1500. This money will go directly to a round-trip plane ticket from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Brisbane, Australia. I will cover all the other costs such as food, housing, transportation, and beer. I will also make sure to document the entire trip and post an awesome video of our adventures on YouTube!Now, I know what youre thinking. Why should I donate my hard earned money to two college students who just want to hangout in Australia? Your donation, whether it be $5, $10, $20 would be just a fraction of the total cost for a trip like this. However, combined with the donations of others, it has capability to provide two college students with the trip of a lifetime.I am also willing to make the fundraising a bit more interesting by completing the following challenges at the respected dollar amount raised. Each challenge will be videotaped and posted to YouTube for your viewing enjoyment.$100- Jump in the Brisbane river with full clothes onCompleted, video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMVAdL4FGyQ&feature=youtu.be$200-Buy a homeless guy a meal and have lunch with him$400- Drink a cup of toilet waterCompleted, video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7f_5SJ6srY&feature=youtu.be$600- Spend an entire day in a speedoVideo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjgG7gxxzWU&feature=youtu.be$800- Perform the hangover song in publicCompleted, video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wni-ilYYC1w&feature=youtu.be$1,000- Cut nipple holes in a shirt and wear it for a day$1200  Ask a random stranger on a date and go on said date.Thanks for taking the time to read this and helping me reach my goal of $1,500. Now lets get Justin Fleshers birthday gifting, hard working, fun loving, sweet little ass down-unda for his 21st!!!!!

Help Send The F Bomb to California!,"$3,825 ","$2,500 ",Travel," July 1, 2016",96,2,HARMONY,PA,300000,1,3,"

                        Here's your chance to help your favorite tii bomb its way to Monterey California for the Legends of the Autobahn event at the annual Monterey Historics in August of 2016! You can help me get the F Bomb and myself out to California to share the zaniness and taint an otherwise elegant event!Here's the recipe: One crusty BMW 2002tii. One neurotic and caffeine fueled rodent at the helm. 2800 miles each way. Across deserts, fields, highways, and mountains....from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to Monterey California in 3-4 days, at a continuous 4800 rpm. All of this in a car that looks like it's got rabies. What's not to love?Basically: I need a road trip. I've figured out that I have enough vacation time saved up, but not enough cash for fuel, tires, lodging, last minute mechanical prep work, or food, for the 10 day epic road trip my soul needs. All of this so I can fully embrace my midlife existential meltdown. I've done two other road trips across the USA, back when I was in my 20s, but now at age 47 it's different. And now it's essential. Life is all about stories...and I need some new ones. This is infinitely less expensive than professional therapy. Your donation goes toward tankfuls of hightest to feed the F Bomb, two 13 tires, street tacos, about 300 cups of coffee, maybe a truck stop shower or two, and my ability to find a dry, bug free place to sleep each night I'm on the road. And yeah...I'm going to spend some of your money on beer. I'm not about to bullshit you. What you receive in return, will be entertaining written updates of my progress in blog form. Awkward photos. High heat dementia fueled ramblings, and a gratitude I may never be able to put in to words adequately. If you provide me with a mailing address, I'll happily send some beautifully made ""thank you"" decals. These have appeared on everything from BMW M1s to Volkswagen TDi wagons! Each one is a hero to me.As many of you know, The F Bomb is my 1972 BMW 2002tii. Through incalculable amounts of karma, the car survived 14 years behind a Pennsylvania barn, and was gifted to me, with the expectation that I would save it and drive the ever-living-hell out of it. I've kept my end of the bargain, because I truly believe in this sort of stuff. I've meticulously gone over all the mechanical systems on it over the last 5 years, and spent the entire winter rebuilding the bottom end of the motor, while refinishing and preserving everything else under the hood. I want to be remembered for what I've done, not what I own, and the best thing about owning this crusty little car, is that it makes other people smile. Help me bring the smiles, weirdo energy ,and decreased property values to the folks on the West coast. They deserve it, too!Keep checking in! I'll be posting periodic updates here - They'll usually be a link to my personal blog, where I can manage things more seamlessly, and more effectively litter cyberspace.

The Grand Advenchair ,"$7,295 ","$3,000 ",Travel," July 8, 2016",59,2,BEND,OR,299000,,3,"

                                                In September 2016 Ill be traveling by wheelchair into the Grand Canyon, an expedition we call the Grand Advenchair. Im hoping that you can help us. When I survived a brain-stem stroke in 2005, I had to completely change how I looked at the world, approached adventures, and accessed wild places. While this has probably been the hardest challenge I have dealt with in my life, it has also been one of the most rewarding because my family and friends have made the outdoors possible for me. Using a wheelchair has not dimmed my pursuit of challenges; its only made me change the ways that I experience them.  This outlook on life led me to begin The Onward Projectwith the missionto encourage people with physical and life challenges to explore and enjoy wild places, whether in the Grand Canyon or the local park. The Grand Advenchair team will consist of a hard-core group of family and friends who have been training for this trip. They are wildland firefighters, mountain bikers, backcountry skiers, and outdoor leaders and enthusiasts. Oregon Adaptive Sportswill provide critical staff and logistical support and film and produce a video documenting the 3-day expedition. Early-on it became obvious that a standard, skinny-tired wheelchair was not going to allow me to get to the places I wanted to go. For over 8 years Ive worked to create and refine a wheelchair that gets me off the road, on the trail, and into the wild. The AdvenChair is now ready: mountain bike tires, a larger front wheel, handlebars and disk brakes that allow control by the driver, and a towing system. This is not your grandfathers wheelchair! My ultimate goal is to design and produce AdvenChairs to allow others with mobility challenges to access their own wild places and nurture their souls.We will descend into the canyon via the South Kaibab Trail, dropping 5,000 ft over 7 miles to the Colorado River, and after a rest day climb back out on the 10 mile Bright Angel Trail.Your support will help cover expedition costs within Grand Canyon National Park including food, permits and camping fees, and pack mules to haul gear in and out of the canyon, production of a video and limited travel costs. Any amount we raise beyond our $3,000 goal for trip expenses will go toward developing and promoting the next prototype of the AdvenChair. Thank you for your support.Onward! Geoff BabbPlease consider making a gift to support the Grand Advenchair at one of these levels:_____ $500 Condor - help with production costs of a video documenting the Grand Advenchair._____ $250 Big Horn Sheep  help defray travel costs of team members _____ $150 Mule  sponsor one of the pack mules we will use to haul our gear._____ $50 Ringtail Cat  cover the costs of camping permits and fees._____ $15 Canyon Wren  food for 1 person for a day. _____ OtherYour donation cannot be considered tax deductable because The Onward Project is not a registered non-profit organization.The wild requires that we learn the terrain, nod to all the plants and animals and birds, ford the streams and cross the tides, and tell a good story when we get home. -- Gary Snyder

                        Hi everyone. Before I even get into my story, I'd like to thank you for clicking on the link I posted and making it this far. It really means a lot! Now, if you know me, you know there is one thing on my mind at all times. Bicycles. I like bikes. The people I've met, things I've seen and hardships I've overcome all on two wheels are the reasons that I am who I am. Though not always proud of my accomplishments (or lack thereof) I can always trust that there is much to be learned while giving things the ol' college try. Enter...The Tour Divide - June 10th 2016""A venturesome minority will always be eager to set off on their own, and no obstacles should be placed in their path; let them take risks, for godsake, let them get lost, sunburnt, stranded, drowned, eaten by bears, buried alive under avalanches  that is the right and privilege of any free American."" Ed AbbeyIf we have talked in the last few months I'm sure I mostly talked about bikes and The Tour Divide. If you're not familiar, I'll recommend following this link ( http://www.bikepacking.com/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/) because it has great detail and fantastic pictures of what the GDMBR has to offer. To sum it up, my best friend and I (along with many other crazies) will ride/push our bikes 2700+ miles from Canada to Mexico, 90% off-road, through grizzly country, encountering all weather from blizzards to desert heat and all while crossing over mountains to eventually gain the same elevation as summiting Mt. Everest 7 times. It's big. Bigger than me and any other cyclist bold enough to give it a go. While many have a completion date (the record was set last year by Josh Kato in 14 days, 11 hours and 37 minutes!), I am stating right now that my goal is to merely survive this. Longer than 30 days couldpose some money problems but let's hope it doesn't get to that.Even if it means dead last, I have promised myself that I'll take away and apply the passion I have for this towards other aspects of my life. How could I not?I do have my own personal reasons for doing this. They're pretty deep. If you're curious as to what would make someone do this, I'll gladly tell you! Let's talk!So, I'm not good at planning things. In fact, I think the biggest plan I've ever made probably revolved around eating a burrito for dinner. Taking on a challenge of this magnitude has been slightly overwhelming on top of just making sure the trusty knees are up to the task. Luckily, from my few years of pedaling, I've amassed a pile of outdoor gear that I'm hoping will be enough to clothe and shelter me while out on this journey. While none of it is as light or efficient as what others will be carrying, neither am I. I will be relying on my go-to plan of ""eat a lot and keep pedaling""How You Can Help!Financial goal aside, I'd like to thank my friends and family who have encouraged me throughout all of my two wheeled journeys. I have relied on those good thoughts and words when times were tough and they've taken me far. Cell service is spotty for most of the route but we will be doing our best to check in via various methods whenever able. If you could, keep those good words coming. The warm, fuzzy feeling produces great pedal power. Thank you!Annnnnnnnd the awkward part!The monetary goal I have posted is mostly to cover food costs alone. A general rule of thumb for long adventures like this is a dollar per mile as we'll be burning an average of 10-15,000 calories a day. That's a lot of cheeseburgers! We do plan on tenting it most nights but the occasional hotel will be needed to get a hot shower/not die. As of right now, I believe that I have equipment and travel costs to and from covered. I probably don't but I will figure that out later Like I said above, I'm pretty bad at planning.Honestly, I do wish that I could say I'm doing this for reasons other than myself. I'm not.I'm absolutely open to ideas though! If you're reading this and believe there is a way I could help out a charity or cause, get ahold of me!Also! I am still in need of some things to make this a little more comfortable (less torturous?) so if you have any dusty, old gear lying around I could be interested in bartering/mowing your lawn for it.Things I'm Still In Need Of- ultralight 1p tent- down sleeping bag (30 degree, <2 pounds)- light, packable down jacket. M or L. Preferably with a hood!- a comfortable pair of riding shoes- garmin etrex (20 or 30)- 29er wheel with a thru axle dynamo hub/USB charging device-dynamo light- a job when I return! All 50 states may apply :)If you've made it this far, I appreciate it very much. Every and any donation you could make will mean the world to me. I promise to turn it into beef jerky and Oreos so I can fuel my need to pedal over mountains. Now! All of this aside, let us ride bikes/party/drink beer together! I'm pretty good at doing all 3 of those at the same time. Also, please visit my blog at Ridebike.me for my latest ""training"" updates and pictures of my dog. Thank you you for your time!Ride Bike!

ORANGEBURG, SC                                




About a week ago my beautiful niece, Imunique Duley was a victim of a terrible pool related accident, in Texas. Our family here in South Carolina tried everything within our power to get there to be by her side. Unfortaultley we were only able to aquire the funds to get her father, Johntrell, and her grandfather Joe, there to be by her side, but we were greatful for that.


We prayed and prayed she would pull through and all of us exspected her to. Unfortunately, after a brief fight, our little angle could fight no more. She left us on the dreadful morning of June, 13th. Now we have to get our angle home here in South Carolina and lay her to rest.


Imunique was a fun-loving, bright, bubbly 4 year old, who could change the mood in any crowd with her loving smile. She could light up any room, and warm any heart because of how sweet and well mannered she was.


Now we must get our baby home and lay her to rest here in South Carolina. I ask that you please take this time to look into your hearts and give what ever donation you can. Any contribution at this time would greatly appreicated no matter how big or small.


I want you go ahead and thank everyone so far for all of your prayers and please remember to keep the Duley, Mcfadden and Simon family in your in constant prayer as we go through this dark time.

                        Hi everyone!Many of you know that I have spent my entire modeling career promoting a healthy body image for women. I often post photos with no makeup or unretouched to show women that they can be beautiful and comfortable at any size. After A LOT of hard work, the modeling industry has finally taken notice of me. It wasn't long before I was booking big campaigns; and they were all campaigns centered around my body such as fitness and swimwear. People wanted to see curves. People wanted to see natural and healthy.In April of this year, the French government passed a law that made it illegal to put models on the runway who appear anorexic. The next day, I was booked by Kombucha Couture to walk for them, and approved by Paris Fashion Week. I couldn't have ever imagined that I would get the opportunity to walk in the biggest fashion show in the world, especially at a size 4.But, Paris is a long and expensive way from Los Angeles, and I need your help! From transportation to lodging, prep materials and other travel expenses, I need your support to make my dream come true.So, if you've ever enjoyed any of my work or the message that I'm trying to send to women, I would sincerely appreciate any kind of donation towards this amazing life experience. If I reach my goal, I will use any additional donations to expand my modeling career.Thank you so much and I love you all!*I want to say a special thank you to Kombucha Couture for always believing in me and allowing me to have this absolutely incredible opportunity. Love you Sacha!

About a month and a half ago I started writing about fear, my own fears really, the irrational kind that stop us from actually living. I've been posting my writing on my facebook page ( https://www.facebook.com/MarkWestSideJohnson) and now I've come up with a monetary dilema. I'm going to do some of the things I've always been afraid to do, go places that I've always made excuses not to go, but what I'm finding is sometimes our dreams need funding, and although I'm by no means destitute, I do not have the means to do some of these things. With some encouragment from some friends, I've decided to reach out to the people who have been reading my writing, like minded people that have some spare change. I'm not interested in a free handout, so I've decided to pay half of whatever the cost of the things that I'll need on this journey: plane tickets, lodging, equipment, whatever it is, I need to pay half of it. I'll feel a little better about things ifI do that.Since I'm just going to see where this ""Year without Fear"" takes me, I'm not exactly sure how much I'll need, but I want to thank you in advance for helping me out and I hope you enjoy the writing. Hug Life.

                        Hey all,My name is Connor Saleeba and I'm a sophomore at UMass Amherst. My much more adventurous friend Riley Frackleton has convinced me to travel with him across the United States, from Boston to Boulder, CO by bicycle this summer. I'm asking for money because I cannot exactly afford this trip. I am currently working more than I was last semester and slowly saving up, but it certainly won't be enough. The money I raise will covera good portionof thetrip. It'll help me with the essentials for this trip; including a bike and the necessary gear (bags, clothing, camping supplies, etc.), and potentially food for some of the journey. For the most part we will be camping and only spending money when we absolutely have to. In addition I decided to raise my goal and donate half of my proceeds to my mom's friend Janey.My mom's friend Janey was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in 2005 at the age of 38. A mother of two young children, she had over a year or chemotherapy, radiation and several surgeries. During this time, you never would've known she was sick. A smile, a beautiful laugh, and a positive attitude made everyone around her not dwell on the cancer. Years passed, she cared for her daughters, was busy driving them to all their activities, and spending time with family. In 2012, her cancer returned. The battle began again. But, through it all, she kept on smiling. Recently, her doctors told her she was terminal. She is in the final stages of cancer. I would like to help her family by giving half ofthe donationsto her family. Her husband is self employed, and has been the primary caregiver for her and the girls. Thank you everyone and I hope you can also support this!

                        Hi! We are Mecca and Kael, a couple of creative artists and healers in our mid-late 20's who love travel and adventure. Mecca is a yoga instructor, Reiki practitioner and dancer. Kael is an energy healing practitioner, actor and musician.As a couple, we love hiking, cooking, meditating, making music, doing yoga and exploring new places. Our dream is to travel the world, exploring various cities and cultures, while being authentically engaged in - and sharing our time and talents with - the local community. We desire to do more than read about other people and places, we would much rather learn and connect with others face-to-face, through first-hand experience.Well, that dream is now under-way. Mecca has been given the incredible opportunity to dance at the ""Abundance Festival"" in Karlstad, Sweden in September - a festival that happens every three years (link to festival site:  http://abundance.ning.com/). Sweden was not originally on Kael's list of places to visit but he thinks it would be an incredibly amazing experience to join Mecca in this opportunity and see an area of the world that has not caught much of his attention until now :-)Our intention is to use this unique opportunity that Mecca has been given as a launching pad to start our world traveling dream, by exploring other near-by countries after the festival in Sweden (we've gone back to our original plan of staying around Europe).We will be traveling for 24 days in total, which will requirefunds forlodging, food, transportation,cultural experiences and any other expenses that may come up.Any and all variations of support are deeply and sincerely felt and appreciated.We will be posting updates (pictures and reflections) on this page during the trip so that everyone who sponsors our dream and/or clicks ""Subscribe to Updates"" will get to travel right alongside us :-)Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!Love and Blessings,Mecca and Kael

                        This is my story of buying a one way ticket to Hawaii, finding a farm to work on, and doing yoga every morning to heal myself.For the last 5 years I have been in a lot of pain. I have had numerous health issues, digestive problems, and intense abdominal pains. I went to doctors and they told me nothing was wrong but decided to surgically remove my gallbladder. After the surgery, I was in more pain then ever and my body began to fall apart. It wasn't until I discovered Yoga and Ayurveda that I was able to set my body on the right path. I have spent the last three years on the Big Island living at the Dirty Shack. I have used these years to practice yoga to heal my body. I have been very sucessful in regaining my strength, and now im trying to travel to India to continue my study. My goal is to learn as much as possible and bring back this knowledge to help other people that might be in the same situation I was in. I have saved money working at my part time job, but in order to fully commit to the Yoga Teacher Training I need some help!Please watch the video, donate, and help my dreams come true.Mahalo!

MIAMI, FL                                




Were going to have to let you go a phrase I never expected to be aimed in my direction. As a life-long over achiever and all around Boy Scout I was disappointed and embarrassed to be told those words in March of this year. However, I received overwhelming support and encouragement from friends and family. The most common consoling phrase I heard was ""this happens to everyone at least once in their career"" but that didnt make ""getting kicked in the testicles"" any more enjoyable. Fortunately, during my 10 professional years I was the model of fiscal responsibility. So, rather than feel sorry for myself I decided that I was going to be grateful for the situation I was put in and take the opportunity of being jobless to grow a fantastic looking beard, get out of my comfort zone, and just let go. Those of you who know me know that I make plans to plan, color coordinate my excel based to-do list, and have very little in terms of survival skills in the great outdoors. This was my chance to do things differently so I got myself some outdoor essentials, got a brand spanking new passport, a few visas for places of interest, required vaccines, and booked a one-way ticket to South Africa. With no return ticket and a very loose itinerary I set off to explore this big planet of ours.I've been on the road for more than the imagined deadline of 3 months and far longer than I or even some of my close friends and family believed I could travel for. My beard has gone through a transformation of its own going from Zac Brown to Zach Galifianakis. Unfortunately, it receives more praise and admiration from men than women which is the opposite of the desired affect. The longer I travel the larger the beard grows, but the smaller this world feels and the more difficult it becomes to end this trip and head back home. The generosity and hospitality of new and old friends around the world has kept me inspired.With your support, I will continue this incredible expedition that will hopefully inspire others to do things outside their comfort zone. In return for your generosity I will send over a postcard filled with my heartfelt musings from wherever this journey takes me.Safe travels my friends!
