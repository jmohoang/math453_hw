USEF's Meg Sleeper Rides in Samorin,"$12,380 ",$18.80 ,Sports," August 3, 2016",99,1,FRENCHTOWN,NJ,2400,6,30,"                            Meg Sleeper                                                                                                                   FRENCHTOWN, NJ                                On August 2, 2016, New Jersey's own Margaret ""Meg"" Sleeper and her mount Shyrocco Rimbauld were selected for a slot on the United States Equestrian Team by the members of the United States Equestrian Federation.The selected US members have successfully qualified to compete in the prestigious World Endurance Competition of 2016 and were chosen based on ride record, soundness, and experience. This year's Equestrian Endurance Competition will cover 100 miles of spectacular countryside across the scenic hills of Samorin, Slovakia. The cost of World Equestrian Competition is staggering for a rider to bear. Meg has been endowed with a $10,000 grant from the USET towards her competition expenses. However, the cost of travel for her horse alone is a staggering $25,000 to Slovakia and back. In addition, there will be quarantine fees, veterinary testing fees, and travel and lodging expenses for Meg and her crew.Out of gratitude and friendship for Meg, and the belief that she is the most dedicated and altruistic person I've ever met, I have set up this GoFundMe Campaign to help raise the additional monies needed to cover the costs to get Meg & Rimbaud to the Samorin FEI competition next month. Our goal is to raise $18,750 in just 16 days. We appreciate your support and your kindness in assisting us to get Meg & Rim to Samorin.Let me tell you a bit about Meg Sleeper:I've known Meg Sleeper for over eight years now. One evening while I was restless and worried about my boxer's health, I began searching for a cardiac veterinary specialist and this led me to Margaret Sleeper, Chief of Cardiology, at the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School of Medicine. I learned that Meg had graduated Cum Laude from the veterinary school of the University of Pennsylvania in 1993 and returned for a cardiology residency there after completing an internship in private practice. She remained on the faculty at Penn Vet until 2015, when she joined the faculty at the University of Florida School of Veterinary Medicine. I quickly decided I needed Meg to evaluate and treat my beloved Bacio! That evening, at three o'clock in the morning, I emailed Meg Sleeper and gave her a lengthy synopsis of Baci's current condition and his response to his current prescribed treatment. Meg emailed me back within (3) hours! Not only was she off-duty at the time; she was out of the country on a sabbatical leave studying and doing research in Europe! Now keep in mind, at this point, I'd never met her nor did she even request any compensation to work with me in getting Bacio back on track!Through our emails Meg gave me professional direction and guided me as we made the necessary changes in Baci's treatment. I quickly witnessed Baci return to his normal energetic boxer self!I credit Meg Sleeper with saving my Bacio's life! I've since had the privilege and unparalleled opportunity to call her a very close and dear friend!Meg is the type of individual who exemplifies courage, dedication to her career, and lives her life to the absolute fullest. It is through her love for animals that I have the utmost respect and admiration for Meg. She is honest and integrity-driven. Let me tell you some more about Meg's character:Margaret ""Meg"" Sleepergrew up in South Jersey. At the young age of 11, she began riding horses when she received riding lessons as a Christmas present. Her father bought her a semi-retired horse the following year. It was an Appaloosa named ""Tecumseh"" or ""Tummy"" for short. She rode bareback until they were able to afford a saddle, and spent every daylight hour with Tummy when she was not in school. Meg completed her first competitive trail ride, a 30-mile event with ""Tummy"" in 1980. That was the beginning of her commitment to Equestrian Endurance Competition. In 1989, Meg competed in her first 100-mile endurance ride on her half Arabian named ""Chaucer."" Since then she has never looked back and has competed in nearly 20,000 miles of Endurance and Competitive Trail Riding! She's completed over 70, one-day 100 mile races! She has competed nearly entirely on horses she and her husband Dave have bred and trained!Meg was on the US East Gold Medal Team in the 2001 Pan American Endurance Championship, where she finished seventh individually. She was on the silver medal US Team in 2011 in Chile. In 2015 Meg finished first individually in the North American Team Challenge in Canada with Shyrocco Rimbauld; who also won best condition and clinched the team Gold Medal. In 2006, Meg Sleeper was 22nd at the FEI World Equestrian Games in Aachen, Germany, and she was the second fastest US rider. Since 2006, Meg Sleeper has been on every US Team at the Endurance World Championships. In 2012, she finished 11th individually on her own bred and trained Shyrocco Reveille, with the fastest US time of 7 hours and 42 minutes! This is a record for a 100-mile race off continent that has not been broken to this day!In order to be a successful Equestrian Endurance Rider, you need a very special bond with your horse; both human and equine need to literally think and work together in unison. This special bond is one reason Meg loves the sport of Endurance so much. Perhaps this unique bond is strengthened by the added facet of relationships that build from birth with her horses? Meg Sleeper not only is an expert in her given profession of veterinary cardiology, but she has taken her passion for horses and turned it into a true modern day National Velvet success story!This picture above is a wonderful photo that clearly shows how much Meg and Dave (Augustine) love their horses and their sport. Please join me and support Meg Sleeper so she can compete in September in Samorin, wearing the Red, White & Blue of the United States and hopefully bring home a coveted and much respected win for the USA! Thank you for your kind and generous donations.Sincerely, RJ FarringtonBacio's MomWith Love from Bacio and all of the hearts Meg's mended along her journeys. + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

They may make you laugh, cringe in embarrassment or well up with tears. Whatever your reaction, they often melt your heart with their take on the world.Now imagine if that 4-year-old couldn't talk using spoken words. Wouldnt you want to give them a voice even if it meant having to travel halfway around the world?Due to a lack of oxygen at birth, my nephew Alex has severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy as well as many other related challenges. Among those challenges, he cannot speak verbally. In fact his ability to understand and use language was assumed for the first two years of his life to be not possible. With the help of a communication system known as Pragmatic Organization Dynamic Display (PODD), not only is language becoming possible, but slowly and with lots and lots of hard work it is becoming a reality.Alex is now a little kid with a very big opportunity. Recently, he was invited to work for a month at the Cerebral Palsy Education Center (CPEC) located in Melbourne Australia. This invitation was extended by both CPECs director as well as one of its employees, the inventor of PODD. This is a huge honor as CPEC does not often accept non-local children.This is the equivalent of world renowned Olympic coaches inviting your child to come train at their camp.  We need to get Alex to Melbourne and the clock is ticking! Alex is being allowed to come because of his age, his current work on PODD and an opening in CPECs scheduleThe only open window of time is this October.Alexs visit will be costly. This is where you come in! When all is said and done for Alex to be able to attend for the 4 weeks we need to raise $14,000 by the1st of October. This money will pay for transportation, housing, accommodations, equipment, as well as CPECs fees.Since he was little, those who have cheered on Alex and his family have been affectionately referred to a The A Team.

ABOUT LOU:Lou is a combat Veteran of the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division and Bronze Star recipient. After six years of service which included multiple deployments to Afghanistan, Lou left the military and attended SMU where he studied Applied Physiology and Sports Management.Lou is currently a graduate student at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business (May 2016 expected graduation) where he continues to challenge himself academically. Earlier this year Lou had the incredible opportunity to try out for the US Mens bobsled team. After a competitive combine and several weeks of training with the team, Lous passion for bobsledding was ignited. Lou has proudly served our great nation in an Army uniform and is now ready to serve our country and wear the Stars and Stripes as a Team USA Olympic athlete. Go USA -- Go Lou!: Bobsledding is a blue collar sport that does not receive much funding like more traditional mainstream sports such as track and field, basketball, or hockey. The bobsled season takes intense commitment and requires domestic and international travel, training, and competition. As a rookie, Lou is financially repsonsible for all costs associated with flights, hotels, food, gear, sled maintenance, and pricey gear. The funds raised for this campaign will allow Lou to compete for Team USA and further fulfill Lou's dream of competing in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.Lou dreams of the opportunity to continue representing the United Sates of America, and with your help and support, it can be possible.

I am Laura Hermanson and I have been training and working with mules for over 10 years. I have enormous passion for these incredible equines and believe anything is possible with them. This has been proven true! My own dear mule Heart B Dyna competed throughout the year at 3 star sanctioned shows earning scores up to 75% and qualifiying for both the CDS state and USDF regional championships. We had an incredible time at the Championships educating people about mules and being able to ride along side Olympians! I was thrilled to be living my dreams, and then my dream became even greater. The US Dressage Finals invites the top two equines at each level from every region throughout the country as well as a wildcard based on scores. It all comes together for an incredible showcase of the best Dressage horses in the US. And then the unbelievable happened, Dyna and I recieved an invitation!!! This is the first time in history a mule has been invited to the USDF Finals! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to expose people to mules on a huge national platform. I have put this together to ask for help making this possibility become a reality. Anyone that knows me is aware of how hard I work and how extremely dedicated I am to mules and the sport of Dressage. It is VERY hard for me to ask for help, but the expenses to travel across the country and attend this show are beyond my reach.

Individual Soldiers and teams representing their units traveled from around the Army to see who were the best trained in the Army. This tournament was created to give Soldiers who dedicate countless hours to training a chance to showcase their skills in front of their pears, encourage unit commanders to emphasize Combatives training in their units and served as a symposium for the exchange of best practices and ideas between the trainers from around the Army. In 2013 this tournament was canceled due to budget cuts. USA Combatives would like to revive this tournament as well as host US Army style Combatives competitions across America. I assume we will be able to raise enough money to hold the championship, considering the number of people we have trained and the number who have competed in past tournaments. On the outside chance we do not raise enough, what we do raise will be used to hold smaller tournaments around the country.                     + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

It will be a massive event & be attended by the New York fire dept, Boston police dept, Denver police dept & the Massachusetts dept of corrections. We are very proud as a squad & Fire & Rescue service, that we have been invited to be England's representatives from the commonwealth in this boxing tournament & it's a very exciting & unique opportunity to build up great relationships with other public sector workers, for example other fire & rescue services & police departments / state troopers from right across the commonwealth & US.They are going to provide us with accommodation & meals for 4 nights, plus transportation to / from the airport, however we will need to arrange & finance the flights for the trip. With the ongoing severe cuts to all public funding, this is not something our brigade would fund. So with this in mind, we are looking at getting financial support & / or a sponsor(s) on board to contribute toward the cost of the flights for around 12 people - 8 fighters & 4 coaches. We will also need to get some tracksuits, T shirts & polo shirts for the squad as well.So - I will be trying to raise around the 7 / 8k mark. In return for any sponsorship, we will have the sponsor(s) Logo's printed on our tracksuits, T shirts & the vests we actually wear for the fights, an official thank you from the Fire Brigade in the media & receive an official thank you letter from the Boston PD. We would also obviously consider any reasonable requests from the sponsor as well.This will be a major event, which will generate a massive amount of interest in the media ,on both sides of the pond. If support or sponsorship of this event is something you would look to get involved with, either in its entirety or in a contributory capacity, please get in touch with me ASAP.

Since our first fall practice we have been working tirelessly to perfect our individual and team skills in order to maintain ourreputation of being a ""force to be reckoned with"" in the British Columbia Rugby Union Womens Premier League. Our team has greatly benefited from playing in the BCRU league this season, playing against some of the top players in Canada week in and week out. Since the Seattle Saracens Womens Rugby team is the only Division 1 team in the Pacific Northwest Rugby Football Union, higher caliber play ishighly expensive and inconsistent had we needed to travel to other regions of the US to seek out matches with other Division 1 teams. Luckily for us, the BCRU is a convenient carpool up north, and has provided our team with some incredible opposition that has once again helped prepare us for USA Regional Playoffs, as we begin the process of defendingour 2015 National Championship title.Since we are the only Division 1 team in the PNRFU, but have continued to effectively prove our competitiveness in the BC premier league, as well as securing the title in 2015, we have maintained ourPacific North seed at the USA Division 1 Quarter-Finals this year! Regionals are being held May 21st - 22nd, 2015, in Tucson, AZ. With high hopes of securing a win, we would then advance to the semi-final game the following day. The National Championship game will then be held June 4th - 5th, 2015, in Glendale, CO. This is all very exciting for the Saracens, as we wantnothing short of a repeat performance (minus the lightning delay) and as our team continues to prepare for Regionals, we would like to ask our supporters to consider donating towards our group travel funds.We have a great team of hard working women that are very eager to make a statement at playoffs this year.

As most of you may know I am a graduating senior in Kinesiology with an emphasis in Strength and Conditioning. I have worked at the SRC and been a part of the Lumberjack Iron family for the last four years. In my time with Lumberjack Iron I have broken a few school records, all three of which are directly related to my sport (powerlifting). In the 140-150 lb wt. class Squat 265lb; in the 150-160lb wt. class Squat 405lb (highest women's squat ever recorded at HSU) & Bench 190lb. Just recently I decided to venture out and compete in the sport of powerlifting. My very first competition was June 2015, with no expectations but to have fun, I went out and broke two California State record in the Junior 72kg class, Squat 320lbs & Bench 170lbs. With such a success on my first try, I set my sights for even larger records. My next goal was the American record for Junior 72 kg which was the Squat set at 347lb in December 2015. While I was unable to set a new American record at my second competition, I was fortunate enough to increase the current CA State record by 10lb, tie the state record in bench, and earn a personal best on a deadlift at 352lb. My next adventures take me to Providence, RI in April 2016 to Collegiate Nationals where I will represent Humboldt State University and Lumberjack Iron as I attempt to break some more records and get a national spotlight; I also head to Aurora, CO May 2016 to Junior Nationals where I will represent not only my family from Humboldt but the beautiful state of California again battling for another national title. Currently I am training to break the American record in the squat (347lb), my best in training are 370lb squats for 3 repetitions; I am also training the squat to be at a Junior World record level (yet to be set in an international competition) which must be a minimum 385 lbs. Competing and succeeding at both of these national level competitions are vital to receive an invitation to become a part of the American National team. The National team goes on and represent the United States of America at International Powerlifting Competitions. I am raising money for competition expenses, flight expenses, and hotel expenses for both national competitions.Powerlifting is more than just a sport to me, it is a passion embedded so deep into my soul that I wish to pass the flame to others so that you can then really understand how I feel.The amount of support I have received from this community so far has been incredible. At this point, it feels like everyone that has supported me is part of the team. I love to go out and perform for my team. I am extremely grateful and lucky to have such a support system. I understand that sometimes it is not possible to help financially, but I still want to say THANK YOU and I APPRECIATE YOU for reading my post and letting me get you up to date on my adventures. I will keep you updated on my training and of course on how the competitions go!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I have worked hard my entire life to place myself in the best position possible to achieve success and inspire success in others. I want to become a professional track and field athlete competing at the National Championships and the Olympics. Friends, what I need now is an opportunity to achieve this goal not only for my own success but for all those who see themselves in my story. My story is to encourage others to chase their own dreams and be the authors of their own stories.My name is Jarvis Harris. In May of 2015I graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. At graduationall my friends and classmates buzzed withexcitement from finally finishing our grueling race at school. But my races were yet to begin. Instead of being in Harvard Yard receiving my diploma, I was over a thousand miles away in Jacksonville, FL, at the 2015 NCAA Division I East Preliminaries of the National Track & FieldChampionship. I was preparing for the races of my life in the 110m hurdles and the 400m hurdles.And I couldnt help but have the same feeling as in 2011 when I was running for Jesuit High School of New Orleans at the state championship meet.Being at those championship meetsat that competitive level solidified in me that I want to reach higher heights and a greater stage after college.Recently, I have been accepted to continue training at Altis (previously known as the World Athletics Center) located in Phoenix, Arizona. Altis aims to provide an environment in which the elite track and eld athlete can grow:[they] help to shape the careers of the best athletes in the world, building championship performers. It is here surrounded with elite athletes from around the world where I choose to cultivate myself and pursue my goals of excellence on an international stage. It will most definitely require steady commitment and consistent hard work, but I believe I am prepared to meet this task for I have always been put to the grind. For many years now, I have competitively studied, sang, danced, acted, and ran track. I have grown since I was 10 years old dreading running the open 400 meter dash because of the pain and since I was 13 years old being terrified of going over small hurdles.But by the conclusion of my collegiate athletic experience I had overcome larger hurdles: I was a three-time Ivy League Champion, a four-time NCAA Regional Qualifier, Captain of Harvard University Mens Track & Field team, and was ranked in the top 20 of EastDivision I 400 meter hurdlers with a time of 51.10 seconds after only running this new event seven times. But as I said before talent, skill, and hard work arenot always enough to accomplish the goal.This is why I must ask you, my friends, to support me however you can because any and all help is appreciated. I will have a part-time job on top ofmy six days a week of full-time training to cover as much of the cost as I can by myself. But in reality, the cost of attendance at Altis ($7,500), housing ($10,500), traveling costs to attend competitions, and other training expenses sum up to an amount that I cannot handle alone. My funding goal is $20,000. I believe that it will secure the financialsupport for me to continue my track career at Altis and ultimately become a role model for talented hard workers who need the opportunity to achieve. For more information on my training at Altis, please visit the website here . Any help that you can provide goes a long way. However, if you are unable to financially contribute, I would be grateful if you simply shared my story with others.To see progress in my adventures come back and visit this page for updates and please follow me via Facebook @ Jarvis Harris and my newInstagram @jarviskharris .

There are seven girls per team on the field at a time, seven sisters playing the sport we love. We are a group of women who love Frisbee and love challenging ourselves while also helping each member to grow to their own potential, as well as promote the sport and bring it to groups of people who may otherwise not really know what it is.    We are raising money for the team to compete in fall and spring tournaments and better ourselves through challenging other colleges and university teams. We have to pay for all that we do with few reimbursements. We pay to compete, to travel, to stay at hotels, for equipment, for a coach, and for many other little things that come along the way. We are raising this money to help our team grow and to allow us to continue to play this sport that we all love so much. We will use the money for tournament fees, transportation costs and housing at each of the tournaments. We need to fundraise this money as soon as possible because our first tournament is coming up later this week and we have more in October and November as well as additional tournaments in the spring.     Your donations mean the world to us because our team is our family. We bond over our love for the sport and we are always excited to add new people to the team. We really just want to play and be able to expose ourselves to more ultimate while also promoting a sport that is so small in relation to other sports right now. We want more people to know about ultimate frisbee and how much fun it is to play. We all want to see it succeed because we know the potential of every girl on that field and their drive to learn and grow physically, emotionally and mentally. We really want to do this for the girls most of all! We all put our heart and soul into this team and any help you can give will mean so much to us.  Words literally cannot explain how grateful we would be to everyone willing to help, donate, or share this page. Every person is doing all they can to fundraise as much as possible but we only have so far we can go while continuing to get good grades and plan for our futures. This team is a huge part of our lives and we all love it so incredibly much and we just want to see it and our teammates succeed.

Building the Pitman Pumptrack ,$707 ,"$20,000 ",Sports," March 7, 2016",16,6,PITMAN,NJ,502000,,1,"                            Steven Blackman                                                                                                                   PITMAN, NJ                                                        We are trying to raise the funds required to build a public pumptrack within Shertle Park, in the center of Pitman, NJ. A pump track is a continuous loop of dirtberms and rollers (smooth dirt mounds) that you ride without pedaling. The namepump track comes from the pumping motion used by the riders upper and lowerbody as they ride around the track. The idea of a pump track is to use this pumpingmotion over the rollers and around the berms to maintain your speed around the track without pedaling. Its a great work outand tons of fun! The design that we will be using will have both an expert track and beginner track. This will allow riders of all ages and ability levels to utilize the facility.Pitman's town council has given us permission to move forward with the planning of the track. It has taken about 6 months to get to this point, and now we need to start spending money to continue to move forward. We are in need of funding for the survey of the site in order to obtain an accurate proposal from the designer of the track. The design of the track will need to be sealed by a licensed environmental engineer and landscape architect. We will also need an Erosion and Sediment Plan. All of these plans will have a significant cost, but are necessary to obtain legal written permission to build the track on the borough's property.This project has special meaning to me, personally, because I have been a lifelong cyclist and have seen the decline of outdoor activity participation in our communities. Let's build something that will get the kids outside and off the electronic devices that are consuming our lives. Pump tracks are gaining popularity because they are something that can be built without monumental funding and can be used and maintained by the community. Many tracks have orgainized ""dig to ride"" days, where the community comes out and helps to keep the track running smoothly. Please consider donating to the cause!

I wish I could say I never had doubts about this last bend of waiting to come around, but finances have had me worry about how much training I could do or how long I would be able to do it!..After planning I've figured that I can make this trip last just under 5 months; starting with a trip to Colorado at the end of July, catching a festival with friends, then my first visit to California for a few days in early August, followed by the journey in Thailand to which I would return just before Christmas.Doing some digging into various Muay Thai camps, I've planned the itinerary I expect to flow with! From Bangkok to the island of Koh Samui, to Phuket, then to Chonburi, and then finishing up the training in Bangkok where I also hope to have a fight or two through the local circuits!I will be posting a more precise version of my itinerary as July approaches, but the total cost of the trip is looking to be about $9000.I thought I would just have to grind and hustle through this final semester, but a darling friend suggested I start a GoFundMe! Brilliant! I feel I have one of the most loving and supportive networks of friends and family in the world, and so I am going to speak up and ask for a little help :)""I get by with a little help from my friends!"" This trip will be entirely drug-free, and very health conscious as I head towards my dreams of being a professional fighter, but also for the discipline I'll need to uphold through the Air Force after I make it home. The money raised will be going towards food, housing, traveling expenses, and martial arts training!For every person who donates $33 or more I will make you one of my cute little crystal healing bracelets, totally personalized to your energy and being that I've come to know!If you have any questions or concerns about my trip or financial struggles, feel free to contact me!

During my freshman year of college, I fell into a debilitating and life-threatening depression as I struggled to come to terms with my sexuality. I sought out running as way to cope with my sexuality and overcome my battle with my depression. With the completion of my first marathon in the spring of that year, I felt that I had taken control of my depression and come to terms with my sexuality. I learned how important it was to embrace my identity and live free of the fears that resulted in my depression. In that moment, I committed to living my life fully and embracing every aspect of myself. Later that same year, I took that commitment further when I ran the Philadelphia Marathon and raised money for The Trevor Project.The recent Orlando shooting at the Pulse Nightclub drew on fear and hatred as a means to quiet those who also committed to live their lives without fear of discrimination. These individuals embraced every aspect of themselves fully and did not succumb to stigma and stereotypes. Pulse provided them with a safe space to be who they are and, by living the way they did, they pushed for progress and acceptance for LGBT individuals nationwide. Pulse was, and still is, an emblem for LGBT equality.The Orlando shooting served as an important reminder for me to continue living fully as who I am  to keep embracing myself and pushing for progress. It made urgent the need for support. It motivated me to take action.On September 25th, I am competing in the Chattanooga Ironman triathlon and raising money for OneOrlando, an organization committed to helping the victims and community of Orlando rebuild after the recent tragedy. OneOrlando aims to restore the spirit of Orlando  to reestablish the community as a safe space, and to assist the families and individuals who are still coping.The Chattanooga Ironman continues not only my personal journey, but also the LGBT communitys journey towards equality and acceptance. In working with OneOrlando, I am furthering my commitment to embrace every aspect of myself and to break down stigmas surrounding the LGBT community. I hope that, with the efforts of OneOrlando, the LGBT community will not just recover, but be strengthened by the support and continue pushing towards equality.                    + Read More"

It is for athletes with physical impairments and has existed for more than 100 years. These athletes arent any less talented or less of an athlete because of their impairment. In many cases, if put on the same level, the competition would be very close to the same. 2nd  The Paralympic athletes receive all the benefits as the Olympic athletes. i.e.: the uniforms, housing, travel and hotel expenses, USA team gear, etcDejas Story - Deja was injured during birth with a shoulder dystocia. Basically, its were the babys shoulder muscles and nerves were torn during delivery. Currently, its an injury that only us, as parents, recognize because we know that it is there. She had some amazing doctors to perform surgeries at ages 16 months, 3-1/2, and 6 years old. It never slowed her down. In middle school, when Deja started participating in sports, the coaches counted her out before they could see what she was capable of. That frustrated the entire family. However, Deja pushed through it by proving her capabilities.She was shot down in basketball and lost any love for the game because of the criticism. She was put on the B teams when she deserved to be put on the A teams in volleyball even though she was one of the few overhand serving and the only one that was spiking. She was spiking and serving so hard that no one could return either. But, because she didnt use both arms equally, she was looked at as handicapped. THEN track season came around. There were tough moments throughout her entire childhood but as a family, we made it seem as if it was nothing. We dealt with issues as they came and moved on. We never let her think that she was less capable than anyone. Weve battled with principles, coaches, other parents and teammates. We let people know that she was not asking for special consideration but we were not going to accept anything less than fair.There was an instance when once of the coaches told her head coach that she would never go any further than high school sports because of her arm. There were times when we would be sitting in the stands at sporting events and we would over-hear other students or parents talking about her. We confronted each situation. We would let them know that her arm wasnt holding her back. We would tell them to watch and pay attention. 99% of the time, they would be cheering with amazement for her by the end of the event.She jokes about her arm as her golden goose all the time. What seemed to be heartbreaking in the beginning turned into a blessing. She knows that if it were not for her arm, there is a great possibility that she wouldnt have had all the opportunities that she has had. Not because she has gotten special treatment but because she has been introduced to a different level. She has always been an over-achiever. She is self-motivated. She goes over and above and everything that she does. She works out on her own. She doesnt take shortcuts. She realizes the opportunities that she has been given and appreciates them. More soshe deserves the world.Currently, she is the world champion in the 100m and is ranked 2nd in the world in the 200m.Weve always managed to travel and support her. We didnt make it to Doha, Qatar but fortunately, she has an amazing uncle who literally went to the ends of the earth to support her. We are asking for your support to enable us to go to Rio 2016 to support Deja and her much deserved teammates. Please give what you can and anything is greatly appreciated.

This small community of Owyhee, NV is located on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation and has not had a baseball team in approximately 40 years. The main sports thatour kidsplay since baseball disappeared are football, basketball and volleyball. This year we started two baseball teams with the hopes of having enough players just to fill the team. When the first day of practice started for our 7-9 year old team and our 10-12 year old team, I wouldn't of believed the amount of kids that showed up to play. Keep in mind 98% of these kids have never played baseball. Our finally tally on the first day of practice was over 40 boys and girls. It was such an amazing sight to see this many kids wanting to play baseball for the first time in their lives. We were lucky enough to have a baseball league allow us to participate this year with them. Our drive to play in the closest town is over 90 miles away. This year is a trial year to see if they will accept us in their league and hopefully they do. The down side for us is that our current baseball field situation is really non-existent. We have a backstop and a home plate which have been there for approximately 60-70 years. The rest of the field was wiped out years ago to make room for the high school track and football field. We don't have a pitchers mound or second base due to the HS track running right through the middle of the infield. Our first and third base situation is roughly the same.  We are hoping to one day have a home field of our own so we won't have to travel 90miles to play a home game. These kids are starting to love baseball and we want to keep their dreams alive of having a baseball field to call our own.  We want to Thank everyone for reading our story and Thank you for the generous donations. Every dollar is one step closer in fulfilling these kids dreams and for future generations of kids.                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I earned a spot on the USA Karate National team after traveling to Chicago, IL, for the 2014 Senior Team Trials. This seat qualifies me for two major tournaments: the North American Cup, which is scheduled March 21-23 in Vancouver, Canada; and the Senior Pan American Karate (PKF) Championships, which will take place in Venezuela the week of May 19-26. In the 2013 PKF Championships, I had placed 7th in the -55kg kumite category, and intend on continuing to represent Texas as an elite-caliber athlete on the international platform. Furthermore, this year's North American Cup is a qualifier for the 2015 Pan Am Games, recognized as an Olympic-quality event by the IOC. Going to these Games is a big dream for me!USA Karate does not offer sponsorship to second seat athletes.The estimated cost of each trip is $2500. I am a full time graduate student, work as a substitute teacher in my school district, and commit over 20-30 hours a week to training - while paying for all karate-related costs out of pocket. Please, I need YOUR HELP in order to attend these trips. I would be grateful for any donation or form of support... Even good thoughts, prayers, or wishes are appreciated!Karate is my passion, and has wonderfully impactedthe last thirteen years of my life. I am also incredibly blessedto have my Sensei, coaches, and teammates at the Academy of Classical Karateand WIKF Texas encourage me towork beyond my limits and tackle challenging goals. These trips are positive stepping stones in my competition journey, and I am ready to train and do my best at the North American Cup and PKF!Willyou help me with this pursuit?Thank you for your consideration and help! www.gofundme.com/MaxineLisot+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

The first day of practice is July 20, 2016 and we would love to have everything necessary prior to that date in order to get ourselves started. The organization was recently voted into the Western North Carolina Youth Football and Cheer Association and we are starting from ground zero. We are looking to out fit approximately 60-100 boys and 30-60 girls. Could be more or less but we have a starting point based on research of numbers of surrounding organizations. This organization means a lot to me personally because prior to the disbandment of our team in 1994, I played football as a youth for the same organization. It has been over 20 years since we have had our own team here in Hendersonville, NC and it is beyond time to field a team that used to be apart of our local football league here in Western North Carolina. It is especially important now that I have my own children that would be eligible to play and don the same colors as myself when I was a kid. That not only means alot to myself, but other parents as well who played or cheered and now have children that are old enough to participate. Our community is big on tradition, and wearing the red and white for the bearcats is one of the greatest traditions that we are apart of. We appreciate any and all donations to aid in getting this organization up and running. Thank You!!!                    + Read More"

The organization couldn't afford his school tuition and boarding so they introduced him to a basketball academy in the summer of 2013, and left Solomon here to fend for himself. This basketball academy financially supported him during the next year although they did not have thefinances to support him. This is now Solomon's senior school year and he needs finacial assistance in order to stay in the country to complete high school and train with the basketball academy.Solomon is really a fine young man and totally stole my heart last year. I love him like a son. He loves the Lord and is grateful to be here. He thrives in school and is one of the favorites among the other students. He works hard and helps out when needed. He is someone that you can count on in every situation. I truly believe that as he moves forward in life he will give back to others. Because of this I feel led to ensure that he is taken care of this next school year so he can acheive his goal of receiving a college basketball scholarship. His coach says he is on track for potentially being a #1 pick in the state of Arizona!Over this past summer he was threatened with the possibility of having to return to Nigeria without a high school diploma and the ability to go to college.

This would be the experience of a lifetime, and an outstanding way to cap off my career.Maccabi USA, the team I will be playing for this summer, is a non-pofit organization that works to preserve and perpetuate the American Jewish community through creating Jewish pride, strengthening Jewish bonds, and growing Jewish identities. Maccabi USA combines athletic opportunities with Jewish experiences. This summer over 3,000 Jews will meet in Berlin, Germany to compete, learn, and grow together. Athletics opens the doors for so many opportunities. It gave me the experience of being both a DIII and DI athlete at Ithaca College (2010-2014) and Central CT State University (2015).

With origins in the 1950's the sport is now played worldwide with play ranging from friendly club practices to World Championships.For all of you hockey veterans who would like a more detailed description of the camera and it's capabilities as well as tax deductible donation options please visit:  http://navisjon.com/ultimate-uwh-camera/However, if this is your first time learning about this sport I can't say I'm surprised; it hasn't been much of an experience for spectators. With practically all of the play taking place on the bottom of a pool, any observer from the pool deck is confronted with a virtually impenetrable wall of bubbles and waves. However, peering below the surface exposes an exciting game of strategy, stamina, teamwork and individual skill.At first glance Underwater Hockey is a frenzy of players moving in a chaotic back and forth as players flick, slide, push, and maneuver the puck to keep their team moving towards their opponent's goal. Getting a good feel for the game and it's fast paced action takes a little time, but once your brain starts deciphering the movements a beautiful game is revealed.Up until recently the best, and really only, way to get a good glimpse of the sport was to hop in the pool yourself. With the video camera advancements making them both smaller and cheaper it wasn't long until someone placed a camera in a waterproof housing and started filming the sport. These initial videos were grainy, low resolution and often times not pointed in the right direction to get the play in view. Advances in video quality, memory storage and battery life improved the video experience, but not much. There still were quality issues and pointing the camera in the wrong direction was all too common. The largest drawback was that the video was recording only, no live broadcast to the pool deck. While coaches and players were able to use the footage, it still excluded spectators from seeing the action real-time.Attempts at live broadcasts were made with varying success. Whether using a single camera on a pole that someone tried their best to point in the right direction or 3 wide angle view cameras that a video producer switched to keep as much of the play in view as possible; the sad truth was that action was missed, plays were just out of frame and underwater hockey remained ""not much of a spectator sport.""That has all changed. With the development of the Ultimate Underwater Hockey Camera the play is in view - all of it. Using a remote control the camera operator slides the camera back and forth to follow the play while using pan/tilt controls to keep the play centered and clear on the screen. No more dead spaces between cameras, no more misdirecting the camera, no more action missed.The prototype Ultimate Underwater Hockey Camera opened up a whole new aspect of the sport. Players and fans can now watch as teams compete - live. Coaches and team leaders now have access to quality video of their players without missing key developments in the play or worrying about not being able to identify who is who because the video is too grainy.But as with all new technological developments, after the initial excitement of Wow! This is awesome! fades the inevitable human response is Can it be better? Yes, yes it can.Two of the features that were most requested by the players and fans who love this sport so much are zoom and game play graphics. Zoom enables the play at the far side of the court to come into better view. Game play graphics such as time, score, and which teams are playing help in the immediate experience of watching the game; but perhaps more importantly they also help bring a sense of legitimacy to the sport.Adding these features along with design adjustments to make the system easily transportable are necessary steps towards providing quality video at as many tournaments around the country as possible. However, these improvements cost money and as previously stated the sport of underwater hockey is a small community with limited resources. We are asking for your help to make this sport more approachable and appealing to a wider audience which can only make it grow.The USA Underwater Hockey National competition will take place during June 2016 in Denver. Our hope is to have our funding goals met by the end of February 2016 to give us a chance to buy, build and test this new design. Additional funds past our stated goal of $5,500 will be applied towards adding cameras to view the reffing table and if that is achieved then adding cameras at the goals to get a different close up view of that exciting action. Please help us meet our goals.For more technical information please visit us at: http://navisjon.com/ultimate-uwh-camera/Here is an example video from the prototype Camera System from the 2015 National Championships in Los Angeles, CA:Here are some of the players/fans at the 2015 Nationals watching a game:+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

My name is Dawson Collins and I am 15 years old. I have been wrestling for 12 years. It is a passion of mine and because of my coaches, parentsand the support that I have received throughout my life, I have been very successful in this sport. I am driven to win. I practice hardand am very dedicated and diligentat what I do. I have wrestled for the Colorado Outlaws for the past 8 years.This year, I have also been invited to participate in the Mile High Wrestling Club on their Duals Team.This is a big deal for me!To receive the honor of wrestling on Colorado's Mile High team, you must be ranked Nationally, and win State titles. You then hope that they'll one day, recognize you at being one of the best in the State. I guess that's where I'm at, but with anything in life and successes comes hard work and expense. I am willing to continue with the hard work, it's the expense of it all that I need your help with. My parents, teams and coacheshave put forth a lot of money over the years toward the travel and registration fees to get me to where I am up until this point. My dad, who works in the oilfield, was laid off for a period of time recentlyand is still in limbo for steady income and though my mom works, her income covers needs rather than wants. The Mile High Team will be traveling to Baltimore, MD the weekend of January 23rd & 24th, as well as other tournaments across the U.S. through the remainder of the year. I also will continue to participate on the Colorado Outlaw team and have many upcoming wrestling tournaments on that schedule as well. I am working as much as I can and fundraising all I can to help afford some of these costs that my family and I will be facing. I hope to one day wrestle collegiately and perhaps even try out for the olympics! I would greatly appreciate any contibution to help toward travel and registrations for this 2016 Wrestling Season!

This is a phenomenal opportunity for Leo to build his career in martial arts. This event is considered to be the ""American Idol"" of MMA; many fighters are offered contracts in the UFC due to their performance in this event. Unfortunately, the many costs of fighting can sometimes be overwhelming. We are asking for donations to help Leo take advantage of this great opportunity. Anything helps! Leo trains year round to become a better fighter, but works especially hard during the few months before the fight. This often requires him to take time off of work to train. In the beginning, fighting professionaly costs much more money than the fighters will get paid for each fight. This is why fighters sometimes ask for support. The money will be used to help pay for Leo's expenses. This includes:Plane Tickets for Leo and his trainersTravel To and From AirportHotel RatesBlood TestsEye ExamPhysical ExamOther Travel CostsLeo's Bio:Leo ""Danger"" Perez is a professional mixed martial arts fighter. He started boxing in the backyard with his friends when he was in high school, and has loved the sport ever since. Leo currently trains out of BoneBreaker Gym in Morganton, NC under Jessy Becerra.

He loves school. He attends Heritage High school in Rockdale county where he has a 3.98 GPA, and is in many clubs( Beta, French, Honor Society, FCCLA, and HOSA where he holds the position as Vice President.) He also helps out in his community as he participates in many drives and park and river clean-ups. Tredarius is truely a great athlete and participates in many sports; Cross Country, Swimming, Track and Field, and Volleyball. He also does run Summer Track, and runs for Dynamic Speed Elite. He is a 400m Hurdler, Triple Jumper, and a Decathlete and he recently made it to the AAU Junior Olympics. It has honestly been his goal for many years to make it to the Junior Olympics. Unfortunately though, the Junior Olympics are all the way in Texas, which is no short nor safe drive from GA, especially for just two people. The money is being raised so that this young athlete can have a way to get to Texas to pursue his dream and achieve for greatness.The money will be used in many ways for this athlete. It will be used to buy plane tickets, rental car, hotel room, and registration fees for this week stay. There are also many items that the athlete must have as he travels to Texas. As being a Decathlete, he must have an Javelin and pole vault, which are not cheap items( ranging from $250 and up) which also cost extra for any airline to fly. He also must have his own implements for throwing events, and special spikes for each event according to the meet rules. The meet is at the end of July 2016 so the money is needed as soon as possible.This means a lot to him, he has worked so hard trying to get here and has finally made it, and now can mark one thing off his track and field career checklist if he gets to go. We'll be so thankful for any amount of donation, anything will help him reach his goal and get here. Thankyou very much and we hope you consider sponsoring him for his trip to Humble, TX                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I placed 1st in the 1500m and 800m for the AAU Southeast Region for 12 year old girls. Our 4x400 relay team ranks in the Top 5 in the country. To cut expenses we are taking a 15 hour road trip to Humble, TX along with the rest of the relay team and other runners that made it through Regionals. As you can see this fund raising effort is not just about me, but it will also help some of my other teammates as well. The championship run is a week-long event (August 1-6) so we will also have to purchase hotel rooms for the week as well as cover the cost of a rental car, gas and food which makes for an expensive trip. We will be leaving on July 31st as the first race will be on August 2nd. So anything you can do to help my team and I make it to the National Jr. Olympics in Texas and bring home a win to Florida would be greatly appreciated and not forgotten. We understand everyone may not be able to give so if that's the case we definitely take prayers as that is the most powerful gift out there.

Due to deterioration, the fields are currently in dire need of repair. A professional assessment was completed and approximately $40,000 is needed to repair the fields. The fields currently do not drain well and a slight rain can cause games to be cancelled for consecutive days. Considering these are the primary two fields these young men and women use, it causes frustration and heartache for the children that want nothing more than to learn and participate in a positive and competitive environment. In order to remedy this issue, the children have taken initiative to take corrective action. They have challenged themselves to collect $20 donations from donors. The quote below from one child says it best:""Our fields make me upset every time it rains. I feel like I should take pair of swimming floaties with me every time it rains on a gameday. While we kids might be small in size, we provide power in numbers. We do not want your donation. We want to give you an opportunity to be a hero to make our community a better place. Just like our work on the field, everything is earned. While we kids are the stars of the show, you can be a shining star by throwing out the first pitch at a selected game this year. All we are asking for is a $20 donation to make this happen.""With the power of community, anything can happen. Our children, our leaders of tomorrow, have recognized this issue and have taken it upon themselves to make the effort to enhance a community asset about which they are passionate.

I am reaching out to former members, members, and friends and family of members of Gentry High School. Our school is in need of instruments and uniforms for our band. We have gone years without uniforms or instruments because the funds are not there. As a mother of a child in the band, I also act as a Band Booster Member and I am constantly aware of the needs of the band members. Our students have tried to raise money for themselves by having a carwash this summer. Anyone from this area knows how hot it is in the summer, but they came out anyway. They held signs and washed cars themselves( with the help of other Band Booster) to raise money. The money is used to purchase shirts, food, water, etc. for these students, but it is never enough to purchase instruments or uniforms that are needed.I know that this may seem to be a large sum of money, but if we all come together and do what we can, it is achievable. We are trying to raise this money at least by October 14, 2016. We would love to have aChristmas parade wearing new uniforms and playing new instruments. This would mean a lot to me, but it would mean the world to our children.I would like to remind you of one of the first things that we are taught when we become members of the Gentry High School RamFamily, The Gentry Ode.Well now, friends and family, our school is calling you to your task.We are in need ofyour help and would appreciate anything that you can contribute to our cause. There is no amount too big or toosmall.

In order to be a part of the All American Squad you do have to try out during a Cheer Camp and get judged by 3 cheer coaches from all over the state. Arriana did try out and she was selected this year to be part of the All American Team and she was the only cheerleader selected in Austin, TX to attend. In order for her to participate she must raise roughly $3,000 to purchase hotels, food, All American Cheer Uniforms, shirts, etc. As many of you know Arriana has overcome many obstacles and has worked very hard to get her spot and we want to do whatever we can to help her participate in this event. Any donations would be greatly appreciated. Anything above the $3,000 amount will be donated to the Park Crest Middle School cheer squad so that they can attend other cheer events. We would like to thank everyone that has helped Arriana get to this point in her life and any donations that we receive. If you can't donate if you could please share so we can get the word out. We will also be doing other fundraisers to help but any donations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again! Sincerely, Jose, Cynthia, and Arriana+ Read MoreRead Latest Update"

TheGrosse Ile Rowing Clubis a volunteer organization dedicated to supporting, promoting and facilitating supervised, instructional and competitive programs for all Grosse Ile students desiring to participate in rowing, and Grosse Ile residents who wish to experience the health, educational, and personal benefits rowing presents. Our 7-member Board of Directors aims to build and to support high quality programs and facilities that promote access to rowing; encourage excellence in competitive rowing; and use rowing to foster physical activity, health, leadership, and community engagement. The GIRC has purchased property along the Detroit River, where it will construct and operate a boat house and training facility. Weve obtained the zoning variances, the planning commission approvals, and have ready to start approved construction drawings! This is where you can help!     We will not ""finance"" construction, and thereby risk losing the community's investment in this facility. Therefore, we must raise the funds to construct the facility and to establish an endowment fund to cover operating expenses.   This boat house will provide greater flexibility to the high school students, protect our equipment, and permit the Rowing Club to provide the residents of Grosse Ile the benefits rowing offers. The following outlines the programs planned at the boat house:Row to the Future A series of programs designed to engage individuals and groups of different ages in rowing activities that promote long term health and wellness. The boathouse will additionally serve as a social and athletic gathering place for current participants and alumni as a means of keeping them involved in this community-based program.Learn to Row/Development - Middle School Beginning with 6th grade students, learn to row programs will teach rowing technique and health and wellness through rowing in a fun environment. Students will be encouraged to build on these skills as they progress into the competitive high school program.Learn to Row/Recreational Rowing - Adult Adults will learn the basic rowing technique in this fun, recreational program. Improved health and wellness and the low impact nature of rowing will serve as cornerstones of this program.High School Rowing - Teenage The Grosse Ile High School rowing program is a no-cut program that uses competitive rowing to promote long term health and wellness. Student-athletes are also educated on the opportunities presented by rowing at the collegiate level (education, scholarship, travel, high level competition, etc.)Club Rowing During the summer and fall, competitive rowing programs for multiple age groups and levels of experience will use competitive rowing to promote long term health and wellness.

(Now we know to be prepared for next year...)But with bills and the hardship of her family situation, her family was unprepared and does not have the funds on hand to help make her dreams a reality.We have 10 days to raise enough for her to participate in this school activity she worked so hard for.Madelyn paid for her own school supplies in 8th grade as well as helped put all her birthday and Christmas money towards the fees for her Softball and Cheerleading during her 8th grade year.Madelyn insited she pay her own way. She told her mother that she had enough to worry about and would work as soon as she was of age to pay for all her own things, and she would help pay as much as she could on her own til then with what ever money she earned and received from Birthday's and Holidays because her mom has enough to worry about.Madelyn is very supportive, caring and loving.

I would like to share a little about him so that you can understand why I am going beyond myself to do this. Sean is 13 years old and is going into 8th grade. He is super passionate and extremely smart. He has been on the A/AB honor roll sincebeing in school. This past school year he took 3 Pre AP classes and excelled in them all.Because of that, he hadto take the 8th gradeSTARtest for each of those subjects and he passed all three. This kid excels at everything that he puts his mind to. He has been playing basketball since he was 7 and has been told byseveral coaches, parents, players, and even two ex-professionals that he has the potential to go far with it. He literally lives basketball. If he is not playing it with his team(s) (AAU/School), hes playing it with his friends at the house, at the neighborhood rec, on the game, or watching it on television. I always say his talent is truly God givenbecause he is reallyself-taught.He hasnever had any professionaltraining, and hetrains himself bywatching NBAgames or basketball videos (high school, college, or pro)on you tube and then trying them on the court. Sounds crazy, but thats how he has learned. If he dont succeed in his attempt then he keep watching the videos and keep trying until he get it right. That is the drive and determination he have. Up until last year he only played rec or league ball. Last year he tried out and made it on his first Select Basketball team. Those kids were on a totally different level than what Sean was used to, but he came in accepted the challenge and made his mark. Over the past season he is now a starter and one of their star players. This teamdoes a lotof traveling, which is part of the reason for this.They aretraveling to Las Vegas(July 24-29)for the biggest and final tournament of the AAU/Select basketball season. I am working on trying to ensure that he would be able to participate in that. I know that is pretty much what he, as well as all the other kidsplay for. To have an opportunity to play on that scale against the best teams across the nation. Also, last monthhis team went to Houston for a big tournament and unbeknownst to us there were scouts there. Sean was selected individually along with only a hand full of other kids thereto participate in an invitation only camp (August 6-7)to have an opportunity to compete with the best of the best in his class (C/O 2021)with the possibility of getting national rankings and become a Jr Future 150 player. He would also be competing to not only become a player but make the Elite 24 All American Team.  The amazing thing about him getting this invite is we found out that not only does most of the kids on his team train with professional trainers (some professional NBA players), but out of all the kids that were selected at that tournament Sean is the only kids that has had no professional training and is currently not getting trained. Not only did that amaze the scout, but to know his talent without training wowed me. I really believe that he can go to the camp and do great thingsI'm notsaying thatbecauseI am his mother and that is what I am supposed to believe, but because this kids never seize to amaze me. He have a dream and is determined to achieve it. He works hard towards it every day of his life. Going to Vegas to play in this tournament is a great opportunity, and getting the invite to go to this Jr Future 150 (invitation only) camp is an even greater opportunity. Sean did his part by working hard and making the team and working even harder and becoming a stand out player on an already great team. I would hate for him to miss out on either opportunity. Therefore I am reaching out to all those that I know to help me in trying to make sure that this guy does not miss out on these two wonderful opportunities, which in turncould bothvery possibly lead to even greater opportunities. The Fab 48 tournament is July25ththrough 28th, and the Jr Future 150 Elite 24 campis August 6th and 7th.Your donations will go towards his plane ticket to and from Las Vegas, his hotel stay for that week, his registration for the camp, his travel to Georgia for the camp, and his hotel stay for that weekend.Any donation is greatly appreciated, andI will keep you all updated.Thank you for your consideration of my lil dude...

I have been heavily involved in athletics my entire life and have always looked for new ways to challenge myself. Several years ago I started competing in Warrior Dash's and fell in love with obstacle course racing (OCR). However, I needed something that could push me more. That's when I tried my first Tough Mudder. It was both the best and hardest thing I had ever done in my life. I needed more. I have ran in three total TM's so far and have purchased the season pass for 2016. I'm currently signed up to run in 11 waves in the state's of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Illinois and New York. I have also committed myself to competing in the World's Toughest Mudder in Las Vegas in November of 2016. If you don't know, this is a 24 hour event where you complete the course as many times as you can in a 24 hour period. I have already purchased my event ticket, plane ticket, hotel, and rental car. All of that has pretty much exhausted my funds. Competing in this race is a dream of mine and I am determined to make it happen this year. I am asking for donations to help me purchase adequate gear so I can stay on the course and compete in this event to my fullest abilities. This is the first time I have ever competed in something like this so I will have to purchase everything I need. The money will go towards wet suits, headlamps, trail shoes, compression gear, nutrition for race day, a tent with camping gear and a few other race specific items. All of this will allow me to do more events of this nature in the future. Any funds that I have left over will be donated to St. Jude!Thank you for your consideration and please pass this along!                    + Read MoreRead Latest Update"

I was recently selected to the U.S. Classic Eagles ( www.classic-eagles.com) and will represent our country in the upcoming World Rugby Classic ( http://www.worldrugby.bm/) in November 2016. Being selected for this team is an achievement I am very proud of, and I am honored to be representing our country in an international competition.The World Rugby Classic is an annual tournament where past professional and high-level players from different countries come together and compete.

Evencio's CrossFit Level I Cert.,$150 ,"$1,100 ",Sports," September 22, 2016",3,3,POWAY,CA,13000,,,"                            Evencio Morales                                                                                                                   POWAY, CA                                My name is Evencio Morales. If you are reading this, the chances are that you most likely know who I am already.If you don't already know me, let me introduce myself. I'm technically Evencio Morales III (I know, I know ""There's three of them!?""). I'm 27 years old, currently living in San Diego, CA. I come from a large family with a combination of active duty and military veterans, closest to home being Marines. I try to be as supportive of our past and present military and law enforcement men and women as possible. As for myself, I'm currently getting ready to pursue an EMT certificate so that I can begin the process of pursuiung a career as a firefighter with San Diego Fire and Rescue. My favorite color is red. I enjoy getting out and going to coffee shops, the movies, concerts, and the beach. I love hiking and heavy metal music. I love college football and root for the USC Torjans and Oklahoma Sooners. Finally, I grew up in the Oklahoma and like to describe myself as""a Southern soul with a Seattle spirit.""Since the end of 2013 I have been participating in CrossFit. Yes, the fitness activity that everyone makes fun of for arguably good reason, and even has a popular joke that begins with: ""An atheist, a vegan, and a crossfitter walk into a bar..."" You can probably imagine the punch line.I have experienced the best fitness results of my life since switching my fitness activities from the conventional bro gym to CrossFit. I'm faster and strong than I ever wasduring my time as a track/football athlete in high school. I attribute that to the fitness philosophy of CrossFit. I don't usually speak on the aesthetic results of CrossFit very much for the reason that aesthetics are a seconday benefit on my personal fitness priority list, BUT, I have been fairly please with what I see in the mirror as well.This fitness transformation started in my early 20's when I let go of myself and let myself grow considerably overweight. I allowed myself to spiral into a driveless and ambitionless person who settled for everyday going to work and then spending my nights playing video games until 6AM while living off of junk food, and then sleeping in until 3PM the next day. During that time period, I felt like an old washed up athlete whose athletic days were a thing of the past. However, around the end of 2013, I would end up meeting a gym owner/head coach in a doughnut/coffee shop (irony) where I worked, who would begin to show me that the negative thinking that I had picked up along the way was simply a myth.So what in the world am I raising money for? I am raising $1100 so that I can take the CrossFit Level I Certification Course.$1000 for the cost of the course $100 for any additional costs (taxes, additional fees, course materials, etc.)This course is a two day introduction course toCrossFit's methodology and foundational movements, in which upon completion, I will be certified to coach CrossFit classes.Specifically, the objectives of the course includes: -An evaluation and critique of my personal execution of CrossFit movements, so that I can in turn demonstrate them properly and maintain movement standards. -Conducting a class. -Holding a standard of effective technique at high intensity. -Achieving relative high levels of intensity for each individual. -Scale for any ability level. -Define the core concepts of the CrossFit program. -Identify the primary points of performance of the foundational movements. -Perform the foundational movements safely and identify when they have committed a form error. -Identify correct movement when training others. -Identify unsound movement and apply appropriate correction toward improved movement. -Apply the CrossFit program safely and effectively while gaining the experience necessary to develop competency in training others using CrossFit methods.I have not registered for a specific date yet, but I am looking at having the full amount raised by November 15th, 2016. As soon as I raise the necessary amount, I immediately intend to register for the next available course in San Diego/Southen California.Progressing on to the next level and having the ability to coachothers means a lot to me because of how incredible and lifechanging the experience has been for myself. I have been doing CrossFit for a couple years and have trained under various coaches (all fantastic coaches), but the first coach I trained under had a profound impact on me and was able to draw things out of me that I never knew that I had inside of me. I don't know where I would be in life if I hadn't gone through that season of my life. My desire is almost spiritual in a sense. The vehicle is CrossFit and the goal is to pay it forward by helping others to dig deep down inside themselves to find that new passion, that motivation, that potential, that confidence, that new sense of purpose, and that vision, so that they can be the best version of themselves as possible. I can't solve everyboy's metaphysical dilemmas, but there is something theraputic about fitness, and I believe that through fitness and relationship, I can make a profound impact on people's lives. Maybe even change someone's life along the way. After all, it happened to me. That all begins with being able to coach.In addition to impacting people, being able to coach would also allow me to draw some income from my coaching endevours. That means less time at the conventional 9-5, and more time getting you into the best shape of your life!This fund doesn't offer any returns in the traditional sense of investment. However, I would be eternally grateful for your contribution, as you would essentially be partnering with me for something much greater and more meaningful than personal gainlives.My sincerest thanks for your generosity!+ Read More"
